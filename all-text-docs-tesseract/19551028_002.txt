Call to Culture

“The great law of culture is: Let each
become all that he was created capable of
being; expand, if possible. to his full
growth.” Thomas Carlyle.

Culture comes to Davidson. Through
foresight, planning. and selectivity, the
gentlemen responsible for the Artist
Series are able to present the best in mu-
sic, drama, and art for our enjoyment and
edification this year.

Varicty and quality characterize a
series highlighted by such names as
Robert Merrill, David Bar-Illan. Bennet
Cerf, and the Rogér Wagner Chorale.

These eight presentations were initi-
ated by a talented twosome: Basil Rath-
bone, curious but cultured mixture of
Paris and Scotland Yard, and Mrs. Gaha-
gen Douglas, gifted portrayer of immortal
works. Their program was widely at-
tended, accepted, and enjoyed tat the ex-
pense of two hours of Art Mooney). Robert
Merrill comes to campus this week as
one of the most outstanding and popular
baritones in America today. His achieve-
ments are only an indication of the charac-
ter, style, and popular appeal of the pro-
gram which he brings to campus.

Culture is not solely for the elite, the
Bohemian. or the faculty. Great creative
masters who are being performed in thesé
eight Artist Series presentations would
not have lived through the ages if such
were the case. These programs are de-
signed for those who appreciate and en-
joy good music, plays, art. and humor: If
you don't then there is a part of your per-
sonality that is serjously lacking. Fill in
this void at the coming Artist Series. As
Carlyle would say, you are not becoming
all that you were created capable of be-
ing; you are not approaching your full
growth.

Dress and Decorum
Some seem to be under the delusion
that culture is to be cultivated agricul-
tural style. They appear in the main audi-
torium as it were in dirty dungarees, mon-
soon shoes, limp shirt with tails hanging.
and an unthumbed textbook in hand for
purposes of impression. It has been said
that one sets the tone for such an evening
by the way he dresses. Brahms is not
synonomous with baggy jeans. Crude cul-
tivators are not welcome in the down:
stairs; and the Artist Series committee
has requested that all follow the direc-
tions of the ushers. The balcony is re-
served for those who cannot realistically
afford the time to dress in coat and tie.

During our first presentation this
year a harsh critic of the Charlotte Ob-
server observed the bellowing of some
lonesome sophomore on dorm row call-
ing to his long lost roommate some odds
yards away. It came in the middle of
Browning’s “How do I love thee . . .” and
was quite distracting to said observer.
You who would unmask your ignorance in
vocal dynamite kindly retire to the wilds
where nature may be more receptive.

Chapel Commendation

The staff notes with pleasure the re-
cent action by the Chapel Committee to
abolish all announcements on Tuesday
and Thursday chapels. The ‘‘most serious
error of the committee planning,” ac-
cording to T.W.W.’s editorial charge last
week, has now been eliminated and the
religious tone and purpose of chapel may
prevail unhindered by natural reaction to
such announcements.

If the chapel programs of this week
are indications of forthcoming programs,
the cut system should no longer be vio-
lated by anyone. Much time and thought
as well as inimitable personality has ob-
viously gone into the preparation of these
services and talks. Many thanks go to
those responsible. Following this current
series, there will be another of informa-
tive nature concerning Davidson con-
ducted by Mr. Martin and Mr. White.

Commendations are also due to mem-

bers of the Male Chorus who have given
of their time and talent to appear, dress
shirt and tie, to render vocal prestige and
worshipful tone to the chapel programs.

Collegiate Christianity

The fact that Dr. Puckett's speech in
Thursday's chapel, the first of a series on
the relation of Christianity to academic
subjects, was prompted by the requests
of students is an indication that at least a
few Davidsonians care enough about their
faith to examine some of its implications.
The question that immediately comes to
mind is whether this is part of a general
trend on the campus or whether it is only
a reflection of the small group of the faith-
ful.

Certainly, to judge from the country
as a whole, we could get the impression
that religion is a growing concern during
these days of uncertainty about the ability
of man to keep from destroying himself.
Books with “religious” themes have been
best sellers for several years, and several
radio and television programs concerned
with the several phases of religion are
very popular. It has even been said that
there is a trend for youth to return to con-
servatism and religion and that it is only
the old radicals who still carry on the
radical tradition.

But along with these signs of an in-
creasing interest in religion have been
warnings that things are not what they
seem: Some have felt that the “religious
boom" is in reality a “spiritual bust,” and
that the more important aspects of religion
have been submerged under a deluge of
superficial or even extraneous teachings.
For some, religion seems to have become
the easy way to happiness and security
in ten easy steps, and to others religion
has become a response to the hypnotic
fascination of the faith healer.

College students seem to have ig-
nored these types of religion to a great
extent, but at the same time they are
guilty of ignoring just about. everything
about religion. As reported by Stanley
Rowland, Jr., in the New York Times, col-
lege students have made very little

progress in church membership or at- |

tendance at religious services. In fact,
though it may sound parodoxical, much of
the inerease in religious interest on the
campus has been combined with a hos-
tility to the church itself.

Some of this hostility is rationaliza-
tion, as the remark: of one student will
show: “Christ passed up the church in
His day. Is it any better now?” Other
criticisms seem to be more just. “A lot of
what the church says is fine, but what's
it doing about it? All my church does is
give us a few parties and tell us to be
good boys and think about God. Does this
help solve the Negro problem? Will it pre-
vent World War III? Will it save a single
country from communism?”

Mr. Rowland writes that college stu-
dents seem to be applying to religion the
same intellectual approach found in other
academic disciplines such as science and
demanding answers. This is, we believe,
a healthy sign. for an unexamined faith
is hardly faith at all. That is, it would be
a healthy sign if we were sure that we
could find such a searching attitude among
students. We can find much evidence to
the contrary. A common attitude among
Davidson students in the past is that of
resistance to any attempt to apply the
principles of Christianity to daily life. A
convenient division of life into the sacred
and the secular has helped many students
to get rid of their qualms about the morali-
ty of certain practices in business, to men-
tion only one field. _

The present series of chapel address-
es is another in the effort to break down
‘this artificial division of the whole of life.
Dr. Puckett spoke on the relation of Chris-
tianity to the natural sciences, Dr. McAfee
will relate it to the social sciences, and
Professor Bailey will discuss Christianity’s
meaning for the humanities. Foreign pro-
phets have made little progress in these
fields on this campus: perhaps our own
prophets will not be without honor, even
in their own country.—M.A.C.

National YMCA’s ‘Intercollegian’
Questioned as to Purpose,Content

The Davidson YMCA has just
finished handing out 515 copies
of the Intercoliegian to those of
us who could afford to contribute
$5 or more to the “Y" program.

After reading the first issue it
might be well for us to find out
exactly what this magazine stands
for. The Intercollegian is published
nine times a year by the National
Student Council YMCA and the
National Student YWCA from their
New York City offices.

Just what is this magazine try-
ing to do? What are its purposes
and aims? What are its opinions on
the vital issues that concern every
American? Let’s go to the maga-
zine itself for the answers.

What about socialism? The April,
1954, issue of the Intercollegian
quotes the following passage by
Frederick L. Allen: “A nation of
men and women secure against ex-
ploitations and acute poverty ts a
nation of delighted buyers of goods,
to everybody’s profit .. it pays
better to produce the same sort of
food, clothing and equipment for
people of all income levels, than to
produce luxury goods for a few
.. . therefore one can make more
money by lowering class barriers.”
The article concludes, “Mr. Allen's
conclusion is that the United States
is not evolving toward socialism
but has passed socialism.”

What about admitting Red China
to the United Nations? The Feb-
ruary, 1955, issue says: “Americans
are being slow in recognizing the
existence of a Communist China.”
The March, 1955, issue criticized
the fact that “discussion of the
national debate topic on the admis-
sion of Communist China to the
United Nations has been pro-
hibited.”

What does the magazine ‘have
to say about the subject of race
relations? In the October. 1955, is-
sue one author states that if any
“college, fraternity, or association
is racially exclusive .. . it cannot
call itself Christian.” “The startling
observation has been made that
Americans are more segregated as
they sit in church worshipping God
than they are at any other hour of
the week .. . Negro Christians and
white Christians should worship

JACQUES DELPECH

together... .” (January, 1955.)

“Education. facilities cannot be
separate and at the same time
equal. One would expect that these
(church-related) colleges would be
the first to abolish racial segrega-
tion.” (January, 1955.) And finally
in the October, 1955, issue one
author advocates, among other
things, such “little acts that sound
no trumpet” as “drinking from
water-fountains or using toilets
marked ‘colored,’ if one is a white
student.”

What about fraternities? “In
most houses the members get a
vivid experience in racial and re-
ligious prejudice.” (April, 1955)
The YMCA National Committee on
Fraternities in Education plans “en-
couraging colleges, national organ-
izations and alumni to recognize
the importance of permitting young
people to select their own com-
panions.” (April, 1955.)

The National Student Assembly
of the YMCA recommended that
“Student YMCA and ¥YWCA do all
in their power toward racial inte-
gration in all areas of our national
life. Be it resolved that this Na-
tional Student Assembly (2) De-
nounce and oppose the discrimina-
tory clauses in local and national
fraternity and sorority constitu-
tions; (3) Urge student YMCA’s,
YMCA's and CA's to try to per-
suade their college administration
to outlaw those fraternities and
sororities which have discrimina-
tory clauses; (4) Instruct the Com-
mittee on Effective Citizenship to
sponsor and support bills in state
legislatures to bar fraternities and
sororities with discriminatory
clauses from _ state-supported
schools.” (March, 1955.) Is this con-
sistent with the YMCA's stand to
permit young people to select their
own companions?

And finally, what about revolu-
tion? From the February, 1955, is-
sue comes his statement: ‘Ours
will be an epoch-making revolution
even if it falls short of completely
attaining its very radical objec-
tives. The present upheaval is a
double revolt—against the West's
ascendancy over the rest of the
world and against Western middle.

class ascendancy over the Wes-
tern industrial workers.”

And fromthe same issue: “The
only ‘chance which the West has
left seems to lie in'the active sup-
port of indigenous revolutionary
movements. Some of these move-
Ments might well go Communist
and remain hostile to the West.
Others might go Communist with-
out being hostile to the West.
Others still might not go Com-
munist at all. This, it seems, is the
best we can hope for. . .”

The worship service of the April,
1955, issue is entitled “The Chris-
tian Community is Revolutionary.”
And from the same issue comes this
shocking statement: “Why is love
such a peril to every stable order?
There is a reason for it. To inaugu-
rate a revolution is an exhibition

of love! Love means taking a
chance. Love is identical with
activity.”

One might do well to ask why
the Intereollegian supports, favors,
and advocates revolution so strong-
ly. Is not the Christian response
more one of peace than revolution?
The YMCA is supposedly dedicated
to the proposition of Christian
service. Is revolution then Chris-
tian?

This is the Intercollegian that
we bought with our $5 donation
to the YMCA. The Davidson “Y"
has spent a total of $515.00 of our
money for this magazine. Since
the “Y” is founded on the prin-
ciple of Christian service, one
might well wonder. how many
quarts of milk $515 would buy
for those just a few feet from the
Davidson post office who will go
hungry this winter.

Or this same $515, which is near-
ly one-fifth of all the money raised
for last year’s Christmas Gift Fund
of the YMCA, would give this
year's fund a big boost towards
its goal.

We might al! do well to
thoroughly examine, study and
question the YMCA budget next
year before we contribute, in order
to find out exactly where our
money is going and to make sure
no one goes hungry at our back

door while we read the Intercol-

France’s North African Colonial

Strife Rages~-While Russia Waits

Now that everywhere the can-
nons have been silenced for a year
for the first time within sixteen
years, and now that a feeling of
improved relations seems to be
dominant after the most hopeful
summer of the age (the summer of
Geneva), France has had to take
up again its arms to wage war, not
against its traditional invaders, but
against her own children and her
longstanding friends, on her own
territory and: in her protectorates.
Algeria is under a state of siege.
Morocco’s situation is hardly better.

Jacques Delpech, of Montpelier,
“France, is studying at Davidson this
year under the auspices of friends
in this country
and the focal
chapter of Phi
Gamma Delite.
Extremely
well versed in
international af-
fairs, Jacques of-
fers to DAVID.
SONIAN readers
this week a keen
and perceptive
insight into the
crucial North African agitation, in
which his country is so vitally and
inextricably involved.

Jacques Delpech

At Paris the government is shaly
and tottering. In all the provinces
one sees strikes, and reservists go-
ing off to war against their will.
In order to understand this state
of mind and to grasp ‘the present
situation, one must bring together
in one’s mind the internal vicissi-
tudes of the French political sys-
tem, and add to that the idea of
a disillusioned, blase people who
wish under no circumstances to
take up arms again, without for-
getting the national financial bal-
ance sheet of the French, which,
with the weight of a military
budget too heavy for her economy,
cannot be brought inte a relatively
satisfactory balance and conse-
quently does not allow a dynamic
policy of investment which would
have a healthy effect on tomorrow's

life of the country.

Ten years of bitter and exhaust-
ing battles, all alone in the mud of
the rice fields of Indo-China, have
resulted only in the treaty of
Geneva and in the loss of that land
to which, in all sincerity, 1 believe
that we had brought more than an
avid and unscrupulous colonization.
I will content myself merely with
stating this fact, without searching
for its causes.

The first consequence of this
military, political and ideological
defeat is the inflamation of Tune.
sia, Morocco, and Algeria, and the
preparation in black Africa for
similar battles which seem des-
tined to break out without delay.
These incessant skirmishes are
bringing Mohammedan outlaws con-
Stantly into opposition with the
defenders of the public order, the
French army. But what the Arabs
and the handful of intellectuals
who direct them desire is a com-
plete autonomy which would allow
them to drive out the French colo-
nists and to install themselves in
their place. From this replacement
there would result a sort of govern-
ing class which would attempt to
reap personal profit, while selling
the country to the highest bidder
and which would in no manner
resolve the problem which is above
all a statistical problem of popula-
tion.

France has brought into a semi-
arid and little cultivated country a
modern civilization, made up of
important public works, mechanical
implements, culture, hospitals, and
comfort. Brought into contact with
the Europeans, the Arabs have had
new needs. A hundred years ago
an Algerian family lived on a few
dates and a little wheat. Now the
Arab wants cigarettes, and auto-
mobiles. What is more to be ex-
pected? Infant mortality once
ravaged three out of four children.
Now three children live and only
one is lost.

In addition to this population in-
crease and this desire to live like
an European, the agricultural and
industrial expansion has undergone
a rising but less dynamic curve.

Why? One has only to study the
geography of these countries to see
that they are mountainous and arid,
and that the mineral resources are
almost non-existent. A latent and
growing unemployment reigns
everywhere. These unemployed
hordes are an easy prey to a facile
propaganda which tells them (in
the words of La Fontaine) to

“Raise hire and cry against this
ragamuffin, this —

Scabby fellow from whom come all
our ills.”

And likewise sixty out of the
hundred Parisian lawyers who are
regularly enrolled in the Commu-
nist party are now in North Africa
openly conducting a campaign for
a general insurrection. And almost
everywhere whole families of Euro-
peans are being cowardly massa-
cred without respect to sex or age,
in the fervor of a holy war, for one
has taken care to tell the fanatical
Mohammedan Arabs that in killing
a Christian they are killing an in-
fidel and are thus winning Para-
dise.

The attitude of the Moroccan and
Algerian French is understandable.
They want to save their lives, the
lands that they have made valuable
with the patience and all the
courage of an immigrant. In this
they resemble the first settlers of
Virginia and Carolina who de-
fended themselves against the at-
tacks of the Indians.

A forced mobilization of French
troops has made this war very un-
popular in France, and the fact that
America has been critical of us, has
cooled off more than one pro-
American sympathizer.

Meanwhile, on the other side of
the Iron Curtain, where people who
can neither think nor express them-
selves live in an almost semi-medie-
val slavery, and those who govern
them oppose us with an unbroken
front.

For Russia is always there,
awaiting first sign of weakness with
an Oriental patience and with this
everlasting display of charm—even
while lying—which makes her so
unique.

Answer ROTC, PT Queries

THE OPEN FORU

QUESTION: Does Davidson Col.
lege benefit financially from the
presence of the R. O. T. C. Depart.
ment on campus? is the R. 0. T. C.
here at Davidson’s request or as a
result of state or federal tegisia-
tion? Why has it become in the
past year more difficult for fresh-
men to be excused from military
training here at Davidson?

ANSWER: It has been called to
my attention that there are several
points of misunderstanding about
the status of the ROTC at Davidson.
The following facts are published
in an effort to clear these up:

1. The college derives no finan-
cial benefit whatsoever from the
presence of the ROTC on the cam-
pus. As a matter of fact the con-
tract requires. that the college, at
its own expense, furnish quarters
and certain other services to the
ROTC.

2. The ROTC Unit at Davidson
is here at the request of the col-
lege. When the ROTC units were
first established shortly after the

tions on any phase of life at the

istration, or student body whe can

first World War, Davidson College
along with many others, feeling
that it had a contribution to make
to the nation’s defense, requested
that one of the newly established
units be placed here.

3. The arrangement between the
government and Davidson College
is covered by a contract which stip-
ulates that the basic course (first
two years) be required of all en-
tering students except those who
are physically disqualified, have
had prior military service, or are
entering with advanced standing.

The Army has informally allowed
the college to excuse occasional stu-
dents whose families for good rea-
sons did not wish their sons to
tuke military training at all. Until
last year parents were not required
to state the reason for such a re-
quest, and such instances were rel-
atively few. However, because of
misunderstanding of the system,
the requirement in the catalog was
changed this year to read that no
student should be excused on the
basis of parental request unless
reasons satisfactory to college
authorities were furnished.

Dean of Students

QUESTION: Since the members
of the junior and senior classes are
not participating in the physical
training program, would it be poe
sible for sophomores to be, given
@ greater selection of activities?

ANSWER: The present program
of Physical Education activities for
the freshmen and sophomores pro-
vides a great variety of individual
and team sports, many of which
have carry over value for students
as they grow older. Freshmen stu-
dents are given the opportunity to
learn more about soccer, wrestling,
basketball, and tennis, while sopho-
mores participate in volleyball,
handball, softball and golf. In addi-
tion to these sports, each student
participates in swimming one
period each week during his first
two years at Davidson. At the pres-
ent time, in some of our larger
sophomore sections, we are giving
instructions in soccer, It is the be-
lief of the Department that the
activities from the two classes are
varied and that each student will
benefit from participating in them.
As this program went into effect
this year, the sophomores will miss
out on the freshmen activities, but
it is hoped that they will be able
to participate in activities of their
choice in the intramural program.

Yipes! We Missed the Beach!

Listen my children and you shall hear

Of midnight happenings most queer

By moonlight rouges had had their fun

Tho’ only faculty saw their pun.

For Gant's swift force outsped the light

And lumbering trucks rolled ‘way the sight.
Smith’s Beach with all its trappings rare
Was hastened off with little care.

When Chambers knelled the starting day
And sleepy scholars rolled out the hay

And stumbled classward unaware,

‘Twas only a bit of boardwalk there.

With humdrum order the day progressed
And yet a spark the air possessed

As some knew not the deed thus foiled—
That deed well known to those who toiled.

When clanging gong called all to prayer

And organ groanings filled the air

They fell like nickels through a grate

Into the slots decreed by fate

While chapel checkers earned their pay

By fleecing our flock for sheep astray.

Amid the coughs and shuffling feet

The faculty's choice rose from his seat

And urged that all should sing with glee

Some hymn just. named one forty three.

The chorus male gave Frontis aid

While he his lovely solo made.

He spoke with such grand dignity

Old George himself resembled he,

But all they remembered in his speech

Was the brief comment on Smith’s Beach.

The students felt that robbed they'd been

By those who moved the scene unseen

And all with mumbling wonder left

Not sure of what they were bereft.

What was the nature of the prank

And who the ones we are to thank

For taking hence those emerald gems

That hold our unfamiliar hymns?

Scarce was a man that day alive

Who on October twenty-five

Knew what went on at Davidson,

Yet some, we guess, had had their fun.
