SLC ReportSuggests Eating Clubs

, AN ANALYSIS
By TOM VERNON
~ Associate Editor
College (President Samuel
R. Spencer Jr. released Mon-

day recommendations of the |

Student Life Committee

(SLC) which’ call for a ma-’

jor ‘revamping of campus
social life.

Spencer is forwarding the
recommendations with his
«ndorsement to the board of
trustees for action at their
Oct. 16 meeting.

The recommendations call
for “transforming .the pre-
cent fraternity system into
a system of eating clubs,
nonexclusive in nature,
which would serve as the
basic social units for stu-
dents after the freshman
year.”

The first change, if the re-

commendations are passed,’

would eliminate. rush this

year through random assign-

ment of the Class of 1974.
Present freshmen would

be allowed to vote in the.

elections for next year’s of-
ficers.

The SLC based its report
on two. arguments. First,

Fraternities Divided Over

AN ANALYSIS

By JOE SMITH
Associate Editor

Although college president
Samuel R. Spencer's Mon-
day statement on Davidson's
social. system directly af-
fects their existence, the na-
tional fraternities here are
- not of one mind on the re-
forms which have been hint-
cd at.
This conclusion is drawn
from interviews with leaders
of the campus’ social fra-

‘ernities, whose attitudes on

the president's speech rang-
ed\ from strong approval to
serious doubt.

that present day campus so-
cial life is inadequate and
that meaningful ‘‘not merely
superficial’’ — changes are
needed. Second, that the pre-
sent’ fraternity system ope-
rates on the basis of exctfu-
sion, theréby shutting out a
significamt number of  stu-
dents from a full social life.

The SLC agreed that an
‘‘adequate social system
should, not’ be based upon
this principle and they were

backed ‘by ° three other .

groups in ‘as -many years:

the Blue Sky Subcommittee —

on Student Life, the Social
Patterns Study Commission,
and the Academy for Edu-
cational Development.

The SLC also _ outlined

specific changes for the
next.three years, allowing
for the same random assign-
ment procedures ending in
the 1973-74 academic year
with all houses haying been
transformed into . eating
clubs with random .assign-
ment as the only basis for
membership.

In his speech Monday,

Spencer not only mentioned |

this system, but also gave

“I thought it was°an ex-
cellent speéch,"’ said John
Bruner, presidem of the In-
terfraternity Council (IFC).
“The president did a fine
job of outlining the good and
short points of the fraterni-
ty system. If we can retain
the good points while remov-
ing the ‘bad, that will be
fine.

‘‘A number of details need
to be worked out before the
plan, can go «into effect,’’
Bruner’ continued. ‘The
method of membership al-
lotment, whether at random,
by self-selection, or some
other method, is one exam-
ple. The end of national fra-

equal play to the idea of
self selection as a basis o
membership to the 12 hous-
es.

The SLC outlined three ad-
ditional needs: Any new ‘sys-
tem should bring the social
academic aspects of the col-
lege into a better partner-
ship, for example, increas-
ing faculty-student con-
tacts outside the classroom.

The quality of life in the
residence halls needs  sub-
stantial upgrading—as far
as physieal plant and as far

-as its socal impact is con-

cerned.
There is a need for in-
creased campus-wide social

activities and for enter-
taining visitors, the SLC
said,

Another feature of the .”

SLC plan is the incorpora-
tion of faculty fellows (per-
haps up to six) who ‘would
be encouraged to dine in the
house fairly regularly,”
serving also as faculty ‘ad-
visors to the house officers.

The plan allows those who
do wish to random assign-
ment to continue eating in
the college union, and for

ternities will also bring prob-
lems » especially with re-
gard to house furnishings,

-but these are minor points."’

| Bruner went onto say that
the presidents and IFC re-
presentatives of Davidson's
12 national fraternities will
meet with Spencer at the
first of next week to discuss
the problems involved in a
new system.

The majority of officers
questioned agreed “with
Bruner that the speech was
“in the right spirit." Teddy
Ravenel, Sigma Alpha Epsi-
lon president, commented
that, “I. was impressed by
the reasonable, rational ap-
proach of the speech. I was
afraid that it would be an
attack on the fraternity, but
it was more like an open
forum."’

All of the officers agreed

that the speech failed to

provide any details on which
discussion could be based.

This criticisni spanned the
spectrum from Gteve Eng-
strom of the Beta Theta- Pi,
who feels that Spencer

‘should have taken. more de-

finite action, to Kappa Al-
pha Robert Truitt, who
maintains that sweeping re-
form may do more harm
than good. All seemed to be
waiting fora more defihite
proposal to be forwarded.
Fraternity presidents were
united in disapproval of the
random selection proposal,
saying that it would create
as many problems as_ it
solved. Alpha Tau Omega
president John Bolinger said
that his house would prefer
a system based on -self-se-

present assignment, the plan

next year.

Giving the. residence hall
renovation as a high priori-
ty, the SLC specified dorms
with public common rooms
and at least some _ suites
‘which provide space for
study and for entertaining
guests, as well as space for
sleeping.”’

The committee felt the
most attractive idea was to
convert the three bedrooms
into. two bedrooms with a

the new system ito allow for
the individual who is not
happy with his Situation.

Although many fraternity
leaders were in favor of so-
ciaV reform, there were se-
veral who opposed it as a
substitute for ithe present
system.

SAE’s Ravenel, KA’s Tru-
itt and Rick Weddle of Sigma
(Chi expressed doubts about
the workability of the pro-
posed reforms and concern
over the impending abolition
of nationals.

“It is a bad Situation,”
noted Weddle, ‘‘when the
college tries to assume com-
plete responsibility for the
social patterns of 1000 indi-
viduals. I feel that a per-
son’s social ‘life is his own
business, an area in which
the student is not under the
control of the Hill.”

‘Ravenel noted that the
number of fraternities ‘May
be too large at present, but
defended the right of a few
fraternities to stay in opera-
tion So that the student could
choose beween different
types of social organizations.

Truitt questioned the plau-
sibility of either of the al-
lotment systems discussed

in Spencer's Speech, He said |
random selecion would cause -

more dissatisfaction than
than the present System and
that a self-selection system
would ultimately revert to
a system based on the asso-
ciation of social ““types.”’
All of the presidents who
opposed wholesale reform
admitted ‘the Possibility of
compromise with regard to
the fraternity system such
as a combination of Selec-
tive and non-selective orga-

sive changes.

The committee also look-
ed into the problem of mar-
ried student housing, ‘dh
area ‘where there is little
indication that the college
has assumed any significant
responsibility.”

They _ recommended no
specific changes, but sug:
gested the college assume a
much larger role as s00n as
the library and . residence
hall renovations have been
accomplished.

people, since most have al-
ready come at noon or 1.
The solution to the problem
is having a better percent-
age of freshmen without a
class at 12.”

, In the past, Kleeburg said,
if such a situation had come
about in the fall term, the
assignment of students to
certain classes and ‘the de-
cision on which hour a

course is to be taught have-

been juggled to leave fewer
freshmen in class at noon,
and hence also lighten the
temporary load on the cafe-
teria capacity.

“We could handle quite a
few more people here if the
would spread them-

ple coming through from
12:30 to 12:50, when we now
have practically no one com-
ing through,” Kleeberg add-
ed.
