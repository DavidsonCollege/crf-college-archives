Cornell Projects New

$5.89 Million Budget

By ALEC HOON
Managing Editor
Davidson College will operate
on a tenative budget of $5.894
million next year, an increase
of $163,000, Vice President for
Finance and ‘Development C.
David Cornell announced on

Tuesday.

“There will definitely be a
$225 increase in tuition for next
year, bringing the maximum fee
to $3,390 for a student eating in
the college union facilities,”
Cornell stated.

‘‘We feel that such a tuition
increase will still keep Davidson
competitive with other compar-
able colleges,” he said.

Cornell took the budget, which
had been prepared by the busi-
ness office, to a Budget, Build-
ing and Grounds meeting on

Monday. for recommendations
by faculty members and _ stu-
dents.

He stated that this tentative
budget will now go back to the
business office to see if any ad-
ditional cuts can be made.

“We will try to further cut
some minor things to reduce
the budget another $20,000 to
$50,000 to make sure that we
don’t run a deficit next year,”
Cornell said.

About $25,000 to $30,000 has
been outlayed for capital needs.
This will be spent in three
areas: 1) to improve campus
lighting; (2) to install a new
voltage regulator, and (3) to
build a new road behind the

gym.
“Unfortunately, there are
some improvements that need

to be made that we just did not
have money to fund. It was a
question of ordering the college
priorities,” Cornell explained.

The money for lighting ($12,-
000 to $15,000) is the source of
some controversy. The funds are
to be used to light-up the area
between Chambers and Main
Street to make this part of the
campus safer for girls and oth-
ers at night, according to a
plan submitted by Director of
the Physical Plant Grover
Meetze.

In his plan, additional money
was to be spent over the next
two years to further improve
the lighting elsewhere on the
campus.

The problem now is that the
college has decided to further
review Meetze’s plans (since
they were first written several
years ago and may need revi-
sion), so that the money is there,
but no plan.

No additional money has been
put in the budget to cover the
hiring of more security person-
nel. This has been the subject
of much student concern, espe-
cially in light of the recent at-
tacks on coeds.

Cornell indicated that several
options are being studied, in-
cluding the use of students to
patrol as work-study jobs and
the hiring of a larger force.

“We feel that we have financ-
ed this adequately for next
year,” he said.

The second expenditure will
be for a new voltage regulator
to handle any current’ over-
loads.

“‘We have been fortunate not
to have ruined the computer al-
ready, because at times the cur-
rent has dipped to hazardous
levels. The regulator should cor-
rect this,” Cornell noted.

Action Postponed
On Coeducation

By BILL GIDUZ
Asst. Managing Editor

The Educational Policy Com-
mittee (EPC) was unable to
act on their coeducation report
Tuesday because they still have
not received a report on the
financial feasibility of going co
ed.

A i1equest for an analysis of
the cost of coeducation was for-
mally submitted to a subcom-
mittee of the Budget, Building
and Grounds Committee over a
month ago. When completed,
the financial report will be in-
corporated into the final EPC
report.

According to Vice President
of Academic Affairs John M.
Bevan, the unfinished finance
report is the only thing delay-

ing the presentation of the fini |
report to the faculty.

Bevan now expects that th:
financial report will be finishe |
by April 3 and the complet -
EPC report presented to the
faculty April 11.

Vice President for Financ>
and Development C. David Cor-
nell explained the delay in th¢
finance report by saying that
Comptroller Robert W. David-
son has been busy with this
vear’s as well as last year’s
budget.

Sophomore Doug Brown, who
is a member of the EPC, reject-
ed Cornell's explanation, say'ng,
“When the EPC subcommittee
was set up around the first of
the vear, Mr. Cornell also set up

Faculty Monopoly Stagnates College

By RICH WILSON
Editor - in - Chief

(Ed. Note: This is the second in
a series or articles entitled “Cam-
pus Governance: Crisis of Authori-
ty.”’)

In practice, Davidson’s present
governance system is one long and
bitter game of king of the moun-
tain in which the faculty occupies
the peak of decision-making, while
administrators and students strive
for a greater share of authority.

The original rules for this game
were set down as thé Faculty Con-
stitution five years ago. At that
time the trustees, playing the role
of omniscient gods, thought wisely
to allow a trial period for this sy-
stem before finally ratifying it.

Their caution proved very wise
indeed. In the intervening years,
the weaknesses in the original set
of rules were magnified many

times. y

The primary weakness of the:
Faculty Constitution is that the
faculty claims responsibility for all
matters ‘which affect directly and
indirectly the educational atmos-
phere of the college.”

But in an academic institution
it is difficult to find an issue that
does not affect the ‘educational
atmosphere of the college; con-
sequently the faculty gave itself
the responsibility for almost every-
thing.

It is clear from the endless fac-
ulty votes on open dorms that they
are not qualified to be the sole
judge of student conduct.

It is also clear that the faculty
should not have sole control of the
academic curriculum, since many
a gpa’ and educationally val-
uable programs have been vetoed,
while such programs as Area

Exams are approved without re-
gard to their educational effect.

While students and administra-
tors have a token imput at the com-
mittee level, the faculty’s mono-
poly of power excludes these con-
stituencies in the final decision
making process.

Certainly the faculty should cast
a large majority of the votes on ed-
ucational issues, but the Faculty
Constitution is so constructed that
this body excludes the other con-
stituencies from any final say.

It is this condition which has
caused the students and the ad-
ministration to challenge the fac-
ulty’s authority on several oc-
casions, and has caused the fac-
tionalism of the present governance
system.

While the basic problem of
Davidson’s governance system is the
faculty’s monopoly of power, this

situation has produced many side
effects in the governance process,

Secrecy is the standard policy
of all deliberations. Most faculty
committee meetings are held be
hind closed doors with its mem-
bers sworn to confidentiality. And
general faculty meetings are even
more -mysterious. Students are
banned from the meetings and at-
tendance of administrators is ‘rown-
ed upon.

A*second side effect of this pro-
cess is that there are no_ formal
procedures for voicing grievances.
In short, there is no further appeal
than the faculty. If this body kills
an academic proposal, the issue is
dead with little prospect of revision
or resuscitation.

A third effect is that it is diffi-
culi to hold the faculty account-
able for any action they may take.
