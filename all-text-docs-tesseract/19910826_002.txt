STORRS, Conn. (CPS) -- A Uni-

isn’t doing cartwheels for her
school these days.. Instead, she
threw the university for a loop by
filing a sexual discrimination
complaintafter officials dismissed
her from the squad for weighing
too much.

The Connecticut Commission
on Human Rights and Opportuni-
tics is looking into Michele
Budnik’s complaint filed in July.
“We feel it is inappropriate to
comment on the case right now
because it is still pending,” said
university spokesman Mark Roy.

doesn’t vary with different
heights. Budnik, unavailable for
comment, told the Associated
Press earlier that, “It’s absolutely
ridiculous. You should be judged
on your ability and not how much
you weigh.”

After her initial suspension,
Budnik said she starved herself to
try to lose the weight, but decided
instead to take action.

rate America is changing its atti-
tude about cultural differences in
the workplace, say two University
of Minnesota researchers. Butuntil
the problem is attacked squarely,
companies will lose productivity
and profit.

Research assistant Sandra
Johnson and Mary Ann Smith,
assistant professor of vocational
and technical education, compiled
information from major firms about
strategies for dealing cultural and
personality differences in the
workplace.

In a book titled “Valuing Dif-
ferences in the Workplace,” the
two researchers note that some

people may thrive on personal -

recognition for their work, while
others don’t. “Native American
Indians, for instance, or Orientals
feel drawing personal attention to
themselves is in poor taste,” says
Smith.

Management should encour-
age cultural groups to share their
heritage with other members of the
workplace, she said.

Professor's Remark Sparks Uproar

Courtesy College Press Service
NEW YORK (CPS) - A pro-
fessor’s claim that Jewish
filmmakers and their Mafia back-
ers conspired to destroy African-
Americans has sparked debate
about his future at City College
and the point at which academic
freedom should begin and end.

_ Dr. Leonard Jeffries remarks
onthe white conspiracy, “planned,
plotted and programmed out of
Hollywood,” came July 20 at the
Empire State Black Arts and Cul-
tural Festival. Jeffries, chairman
of the college’s Black Studies
Department, also said that “the
white boy can’t be trust

Since then, university officials
have received an onslaught of
complaints, including requests for
disciplinary action against Jeffries
from the state attorney general,
state legislators, Senate Majority
Leader Ralph Marino and Gov.
~ Mario Cuomo. ~

“The governor isn’t telling
(university officials) what to do,”

said Terry Lynam, a spokesman
for Cuomo. : “He just thinks that
these comments are so egregious
that City College ought to take
action or explain to the community
why no action was taken.”

Others have asked for Jeffries’
resignation from his position as
black studies.chairman and from
City College.

“The governor is concerned
because this is a free speech issue,
but he felt he needed to say some-
thing because the comments were
intemperate, inaccurate and de-
structively divisive,” Lynam said.

University officials have said

~ that while they don’t support what

Jeffries said and plan to investi-
gate, they do support his right to
free speech.

“I would like to reassure you I
will conduct a thorough review of
the situation,” City College Presi-
dent Bernard Harleston wrote ina
letter to the City University chan-
cellor and CUNY’s board of trus-
tees. That review will begin in the

fall and will include input from
students and faculty.

CUNY Chancellor Ann Rey-
nolds, along with the board of trus-
tees chairman and vice chairman,
issued a statement saying that uni-
versity officials were “shocked and
disturbed” by Jeffries’ comments
and that they “inténd to examine
Professor Jeffries’. actions and
statements and, if warranted, to
pursue vigorously with City Col-
lege the remedies that may be
appropriate and available.”

The chancellor also released a
statement saying she supports
Harleston’s handling of the inci-
dent, according to David Fields,
special counsel to the chancellor.

“These are very serious state-
ments” that Jeffries has made,
Fields said.

Cuomo agrees. “The larger
issue is that we need to deal with
this kind of attitude,” Lynam said.
“This is not just a Jewish-black-
white issue. It divides us as a city,
a State and a nation.”

Town Enforces Speed Limits

By Tom Koonce

Inanattemptto prevent speed-
ing in Davidson, the town’s police
have been asked to enforce the
current speed limit more rigidly.

During last week’s Town Hall
meeting, aconcerned group of citi-
zens asked that the speed limit be
lowered on Main Street and Con-
cord Road.

The current speed limit on
those streets is 35 mph. The citi-
zens asked for this to be lowered to
25 mph.

_After discussing this proposal
it was decided that the current speed
limit is adequate and a lowered
limit is not needed if the public is

sors also tend to stock labs accord-
ing to the needs of the courses they
teach, and when that professor
leaves their institution, full inven-
tories are rarely taken. Said Bar-
ber, “Professors have a bad way of
squirreling away chemicals.”

Schools are becoming more
sensitive to these problems, how-
ever, by taking more thorough
inventories more often, as well as
discontinuing the purchase of
chemicals in bulk amounts. Ac-
cording to Giduz, the money saved
by buying large amounts of chemi-
cals does notcompareto the amount

it costs the college to remove the

forgotten excess. Saturday’ sclean-
up cost approximately $5,000.
Giduz also noted that the col-
lege no longer uses piric acid in
chemistry experiments, due to its
potential volatility.

law.

According to Mayor Russell
Knox the police have, “strict in-
structions to enforce the current
speed limit.” Knox added that
speeding on these roads is not a
problem that has justcome up since
Davidson students returned to
campus.

Students should therefore be
aware that there will be increased
police enforcement of the 35 mph
speed limit on Main Street and
Concord Road. Town Adminis-
trator Leamon Brice warned,
“We'll place an officer out there as
often as possible.”

There will be an open house in
