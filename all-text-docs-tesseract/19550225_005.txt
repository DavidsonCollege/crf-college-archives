Wildcat Varsity

Outlook

Seems Better Than Ever

By BUNNY PERKINSON

In the spring when most every young man’s fancy turns
to love, there are a select few whose fancy is directed along
other lines—those across the football field. While most David-
son men are concerned with frolic and fun, these sixty or
seventy are primarily concerned with blocking and tackling
(also done on the football field). Each spring, they devote
some twenty days to practice, over a period of time beginning
on February 1 and continuing to March 5th.

. These spring “workouts” are
considered by many experts to be
the time when a football team
makes or breaks itself for the
next season, so all the Cat sup-
porters hope that this year’s ses-
sion has been a good one. In fact,
some of the alumni who closely
follow and lend great support to
Davidson athletics through the
Wildeat Club are interested
enough to learn first hand how

strong next year’s Cats will be.!

They have assembled some players
of the pre-Korean War days and
challenged the Cats to a game
on March 5, the day spring prac-
tice ends. Besides learning how
strong next year’s squad will be,

these Wildcat Clubbers have in:

mind—only way in the back of
their minds, naturally—raising as
much as $5,000 to cohtribute to
the athletic fund here at David-
son for 1955-56. This great sacri-
fice on the part of their bodies as
well as dollars to the cause of Da-
vidson athletics is certainly to be
admired and greatly appreciated
by the student body.

The “Old-Timers,” as they are
called, should provide some real
competition for the varsity squad,
and this game is a fitting climax
to the spring practice. Coaches
Dole, Hambright, Clements, and
Acker have done a great job of
rounding the squad into excellent
form. Practices have been long and
hard, but it will certainly pay off
next week and next fall.

Numerous changes in personnel
have necessitated several changes

in position for some of the squad.
The loss of Henry Brown at the
fullback spot left a great gap to
be filled, so Harley Smith has been
moved over from the halfback
position. He and Ken Conger, ably
assisted by Jim West, will provide
as much ability as can be needed
at that position. To fill the half-
back posts vacated by Jim Thacker

and Smith, and to bolster the gap!-

made when Greg Poole dropped
from the squad, the coaches have
decided to move Bill Rowland to
halfback in order to make use of
the running ability he displayed
on occasions last ‘year. He will
team with Don McCree, Don Camp-
bell, Don Comer, plus Harry
Heinitsh and Ralph Setzler, up
from the JVs, to give more than
adequate strength to the halfback
spot.

The quarter back position is
being held by Dyke Little and Dick
Belton, juniors next season, and

Harris, a rising sophomore.

The end position should be one
of the team’s strongest points next
season. barring any injuries. Al.
though the loss of Charlie Rankin,
Corky King, and Lea Powell will
certainly be felt, plenty of first-
rate material remains in the per-
sons of Tom Newton, Bill Gramley,
Jim Patterson, and Bob Campbell
of last year’s squad. All except Pat-
terson (a rising senior) will be
juniors next year. David Fagg was
an outstanding end’ on the JVs
and should add to the strength

HOBBY COBB

Broken Finger Halts
Cobb’s Scoring Spree

By BOB PULLIAM

When Davidson College took the floor Monday night
against Catawba, something seemed to be missing from the
Cats—it was the Cats’ high-scoring center Hobby Cobb who
was out with a broken finger. The Cats, sparked by Ray Hard-
ing, played well in winning, but Cobb’s absence was evident.

Hobby, this year’s leading scorer
and rebounder for the Cats, hails
from Charlotte, North Carolina,
where he starred for Central High
School before coming to Davidson.
Hobby is twenty years old and
stands six feet three inches tall.

Here at Davidson, Hobby has
displayed his talents for the Cats
for three years, playing varsity
ball as a freshman and stepping
into a starting position in his
sophomore year. Fourth in scoring
his freshman year, Cobb last year
stepped into the scoring position
held by Joe Dudley and led the
team with 381 points and a game
average of just over sixteen points.
This year Hobby has taken over
where he left off last year and
has scored a 22.2 average to date.
Cobb played forward and guard
his first two years, but due to a
marked lack of height in the Cats’
lineup, Coach Miller switched him
to center where he took over as if
he had played there all his life.

Hobby is majoring in business
and hopes to enter some field of
the business world on graduation.
He is a member of the Kappa Sig-
ma Fraternity, vice-president of
the Student Council, vice president
of the D Club and member of the
Beaver Club.

Hobby is likened to another Da-
vidson great, Whit Cobb, who was
Southern Conference Athlete of
the Year in 1050, Cosch Miller
feels that Hobby will rate as one

of the finest players ever to wear
a Davidson uniform.

On Monday of this week the
Charlotte Observer published the
Observer’s 1955 All-State team.

With an abundance of stars at

such schools as State, Duke, Wake

Forest, and Carolina, it was not}

expected that a player or a team
of the caliber of Davidson’s could
place a player on the top three
teams. However, Cobb was placed
on the third team among such
stars as Vayda of North Carolina
and Scheffel of State. All the
players on the first three teams
are playing on a winning team with
the exception of Cobb, which
speaks for his ability. Only six
of the players selected are cur-
rently outscoring Hobby, and three
of those are only by a point or less.
Hobby rates Dickie Hemric, the
All-American from Wake Forest,
as the best player he has played
against in his three years at Da-
vidson, and looking at Hemric’s
record, one can readily tell why.
At the present, Hobby is out of
the lineup with a broken finger
sustained in practice. He will prob-
ably be out for about two weeks,
and it is hoped by all concerned
that the finger will be healed by
the time the Southern Conference
tournament rolls around on March

3rd, 4th, and Sth.

THE DAVIDSONIAN

PAGE FIVE

Alumni-Varsity Game Set For March $

““Old Timers’ Return As
Cats End Spring Practice

Next Saturday afternoon will bring football back to the
Davidson campus for a brief two-hour period as the Davidson
Varsity meets a group of Wildcat Alumni who played here
in early post-war days. The game will get under way at 2:15
p-m. on Richardson Field, The contest will pit some of David-
son’s former stars against the group that, last season, brought
Davidson its best season since 1933. Gone will be seven
seniors who played a very important role in that record, but
the slack is being taken up by some who are just as good.

Alumni Line-up Boasts Surplus Of Stars

-When the Davidson Alumni
team takes the field next Saturday
against Davidson's present Varsity
squad, the “Old Timers” line-up
will have a host of former Wildcat
Stars. The squad will be taken
from the teams of 1946-1949 and
will also have a few pre-war play-
ers in the line-up. Johnny Mack-
orell and “Teeny” Lafferty are two
outstanding players in the latter
category.

Coach Bill Story will have only

three days to work with his squad,
and many of the boys will be out
of shape. Nevertheless, the talent
and experience are enough to make
this an awfully tough team. Lead-
ing the “Old Timer” attack will
be All-Conference tailback Auburn
Lambeth, holder of all known pass-
ing records at Davidson. The line
for the Alumni will be big, and
have plenty of speed, with Jim
Fasul and Bill Acker playing with
the group since they were on the

squads before going into service.

Listed below is the full squad
of the Alumni, listed by positions:
Ends—-Dick O'Hair, Tom Comer,
Bill Iverson, and Cecil Brandon.

Tackles—Sandy Carnegie, Ernie
Stricklin, Carl Eborn, “Easy”
Rhodes, and  Hoopy Davis.

Guards—Bob Sharpe, Bill Boyd,
Buddy Chandler, Red Wilson, and

Jim Fasul. Centers—-Henry Wilson,
Bronco Bailey, and Bill Acker.
Blocking backs—Red Bethea, Char-

lie Rimer, and Grover Lee. tail-
backs—Auburn Lambeth and Cliff
Turner. Wingbacks — Jack Wade
and Dave Erwin. Fullbacks—Mack
Erwin and Car? Pahl.

There may be other additions
to the line-up before before the
Saturday scrap comes around, but
this is the squad at present. Most
of the members are due to come
in next Thursday and Friday, with
the entire number expected for

the Friday practice.

The game is being sponsored by
the Wildcat Club, in conjunction
with their annual fund-raising cam-
paign. Tickets are on sale and
cost $1 for students and $1.50 for
adults. The goal for the drive is
$5,000, and the Wildcat Clubbers

are counting on the student body.

to help reach it.’

It is hoped that this game will
become an annual event, for in
the past, the spring practice ses-
sion has always closed with an
intra-squad game. With the alumni
rallying to the support of the
“Old Timers,” as the alumni team
will be called, it seems that not
only will the Davidson football
team have a scrap on its hands, but
the Davidson cheering section as
well.

The game will give both stu-
dents and alumni an opportunity
to have a look at what next year’s
Varsity will look like. It will also
be a test for the team against
older and more experienced
players. Friendly competition is
the pass-word, and the alumni will
supply enough steam to really

make the Cats work.

The students will have an op.
portunity to see what the Davidson
single wing, as run by Coach Bil)
Story, looked like. Davidson did
not run up against this type forma-
tion last season since most clubs
now use the “T” and its varia-
tions. The Wildcats will move.
from the “T” and the Notre Dame
Box. the latter being quite familiar
to upperclassmen who saw .Dole’s
1952 team use it.

The game will be a rough one,
physically, for some of the Alumni
squad, since they have had quite
a long lay-off. The question of
reserve strength comes to the fore-
ground as the big one. If the
Alumni can keep enough substi-
tutes handly to relieve the tiring
players, it should be a whale of
a scrap. Many of the Alumni group
have been working in jobs which
keep them in pretty good shape,
and the going will be pretty rough
when they're in there. It’s going
to be a pleasant afternoon for all

football fans, so don’t slip up and *

miss the eontest. Get a ticket, and
back the Wildcats.
