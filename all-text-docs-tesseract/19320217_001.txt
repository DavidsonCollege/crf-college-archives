retary for Mission Work

Last Tuesday morning at chapel Dr. C. Darby
Fulton began his Mission School with the stu-
dent body as a whole. The schedule was shifted
somewhat in order that he might have a greater
length of time in which to tell all that he de-
sired. The address was on missions and their
relation students. Dr. Fulton amply
capable of giving this very helpful advice to the
students, as he has, for some number of years,
quite a bit of student work, especially
in regards to missions and missionaries, and

has had experience in Japan.

The chapel hour was not, however, the first
address presented by Dr. Fulton. He had be-
gun. his speeches at one of the Sophomore Bible
classes just before the chapel period. This was
continued immediately after chapel at two more
of the Sophomore Bible classes. were
held in the for first,
that all the separate classes under the different
instructors might meet together; and second,
that any students with vacant periods might
take advantage of these extra addresses, gain-
ing more than would be the case should they
have attended only those given at the morning
prayers.

On Wednesday his schedule was the same.
with the exception that he spoke to the Fresh-
man classes instead of those. just above them,
these also meeting in the auditorium for the
same purposes.

These

auditorium two reasons:

The subject of the speeches in all cases was
practically the same. They centered around “the
student and the mission.” He presented and
answered any questions that might be troubling
students about any phase of mission life and
activities.

As scheduled, he talked to the Ministerial
Band and the Student Volunteer group Tues-
day evening at 7 o'clock. Tonight at the same
time he will hold informal discussion, an open
forum, at the Y. M. C. A. social center. There,
still more individual student questions will be
answered.

As a speaker Dr. Fulton is quite eloquent,
and, to say the least, very interesting, David-
son is very proud to have had Dr. Fulton pre-
sent some of his student volunteer work. Be-
sides this work, his addresses have carried him
to many national conventions.

Annual Junior Speaking

Scheduled ed March 18-19

On March 18 and 19? the 19 the class of 1933 will
put pn what should prove to be one of the
house parties of the year,

This house party, Junior Speaking, will be-
gin with a dance Friday night, from 10 to 2,
and will continue through Saturday night.

best

On Saturday afternoon there will be two
attractions. One is the annual high school track
meet, at which high schools from all over the
state will be represented, and the other is the
tea dance which will take place after the track
meet, from 4:30 to 7.

Following the tea dance there will be a Satur-
day night dance from 9 to 12, which will offi-
cially conclude the week-end celebrations.

All of these dances will be informal, and all
of them will take place in the Charlotte Arm-
ory, providing plenty of space for the large
crowd that is expected) to attend.

This crowd will be greatly augmented due
to the fact that the Junior class has been able
to secure as the orchestra for these dances
the nationally-known Edward's Collegians, that
famous negro orchestra that last year closed
their third successive season at the Greystone
Ballroom in Cincinnati, Ohio.

The orchestra contains ten pieces, one of them
particularly, a trumpet player, being an excel-
lent soloist. But the orchestra features not so
much solo work as harmony, featuring first the
brass section, two, trumpets and a trombone,
then the saxophone section, and so forth.

Also, instead of having a voice solo on most
oftheir pieces,.the orchestra brings into use the
famous negro ear for harmony in using a trio
for a large number of them.
