in Charlotte.
General Discussion
Mr. Hayward discussed
broadcasting in general, taking up
the fields of engineering, drama,
studio announcing, and sports an-
nouncing. Going into more detail,
he discussed the field of commercial
broadcasting and the Federal-Com-

Hill, but the old Davidson spirit is
in essence just what you made it
when you were in school.

So welcome, alumni. We've al-
ready met you, although we didn’t
recognize you individually, in the
customs and spirit we found when
we came. When you come here
this week-end, we'll probably be
awkward in our conversation with

radio

munications. Commission which|you. You won't understand all our
deals, with the legal side of broad-} expressions; we won't get all your
casting. view-points.. But we'll realize down

The course is to include a field
trip or two to Station WBT.
There will be a small fee to cover
all such matters.

underneath that you had your Share
in making Davidson what it is to-
day. And because of that you are
sincerely and warmly welcome,
