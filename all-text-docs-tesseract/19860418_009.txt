Joe Jackson cursed with purity

Short Takes

Big World
A&M Records CS 6021

Joe Jackson has fallen victim to a
curse that is rare in popular music, the
curse of purity. His last album, Body and
Soul, was recorded live (without an audi-
ence or overdubs) in a large music hall in
NYC. And that’s fine. It sounded great.
It was a joy to listen to. Best of all, I sup-
pose, Joe didn’t prostitute any of those
sacred musical values of his. But now,
Joe's values have “evolved.” For his new
album, Big World, things have gotten
even simpler. Not only is he playing in
small acoustically satisfying clubs, not
only is he using only a two track recorder
(as opposed to 16, 24, or 32) and no over-
dubs, but he is playing in front of a real
LIVE audience who don’t even cheer or
applaud. Well, I’m certainly impressed.
It really does sound great. But, uh, Joe,

what about the songwriting?
Songwriting? You mean the sound?
The songs sure sound good. This is
Jackson's fatal mistake. He has lost him-
self in the sound of his own music and
forgotten the songs themselves. But |
guess that this is a lot like a live show, I
mean if you've had a few beers, turn off
the brain, and listen. But if Joe Jackson
really wants to bring live music in its
“pure” form to the public, why doesn’t he
tour more often? If he’s going to make re-
cords at all, why ignore or rebel against
that convention? The eventual result on
Big World is that all the songs sound
good, but they almost all sound the same.
The standouts are “Wild West,” “The Jet
Set,” “Right and Wrong,” “We Can’t
Live Together,” and “Forty Years.” In
fact, these songs could have made a re-
ally striking live EP, but as it is there are
ten other songs that are hardly distin-
guishable from most of Jackson’s work in

the last several years. Not to say that this
is a bad album. If you like Joe Jackson,
you'll really like this record. But if you
expect a lot of him you'll be disap-
pointed.

Robyn Hitchcock and the Egyptians
Fegmania
Slash Records 25316-!

Wednesday aftemoon. One record
review down, one to go. “Hey
guys .. . Do you know any interesting
records that have come out lately?”

“Yeah Lee, there is this really neat re-
cord by Robyn Hitchcock and the Egyp-
tians. Its called Fegmania.” (Lee doubt-
fully) “Fegmania . . . Really?”

I admit it. I was incredulous. Feg-
mania is not the sort of album that you ex-
pect in 1986. This record would have
been more at home in 1968. It uses a
combination of psychedelic lyrics and
new wave (I mean that in the sense of that

revolutionary period of '77-'81) musical
values. The songs are either disturbingly
surreal or humorously absurd. From the
giddy, “My Wife and My Dead Wife,” to
the enthralling “Heaven,” this album en-
tertains unabashedly without pretense.
And since the album sets out to do little
more than engage its audience, it is prob-
ably one of the most successful albums |
have heard in months.

The music works in layers, not only
referring to older styles, but diving into
unknown depths of the absurd. Through
it all, the musical quality endears the lis-
tener despite the alienating lyrics. Favor-
ite tracks include: “Another Bubble.”
“The Man With the Lightbulb Head,”
“Strawberry Mind.” “Glass.” and
“Heaven.” But Fegmania is not for ev-
erybody. If you are looking for a record
that is titilating, interesting, and simply
fun, I recommmend Fegmania.

Council member Mayhew discusses town

By NELLE MCCORKLE

William B. (W.B.) Mayhew,
town council member, has sold
hotdogs, improved streets, and
dressed as Santa Claus, all for the
benefit of Davidson.

Retired from the position of
postmaster since 1980, Mayhew
was born in Comelius and moved
to Davidson in 1926. His father
worked on the college mainte-
nance crew, and Mayhew grew up
in an on-campus house located
east of the current gymnasium. He
remembers sitting on a sandpile at
the age of six or seven watching
construction of the west end of the
stadium. The site of the present
athletic fields “was pretty much
my private stomping area,”
Mayhew said. He set rabbit traps
there in winter, picked blackber-
ries on summer mornings, and
caddied on the golf course there
on summer afternoons. Cows
grazed in then undeveloped Pat-
terson Court, and Mayhew’s
father raised chickens and pigs in
what is now a parking lot adjacent
to Richardson dormitory.

“It’s grown,” Mayhew said of
the college, “but in a nice, slow

way, just the way we hope the
town will.” He called the town “an
island of tranquility surrounded
by all these people who want to
build.” He predicted limited geo-
graphic expansion for the town
because of the closeness of Cor-
nelius to the south and Lake Nor-
man to the west, although he
noted recent annexation of lake
condominium developments.

Mayhew praised the town
government’s continuity, and
mentioned a long-term plan to
build a town park across from In-
gersoll-Rand. While serving on
the governor's Transportation Ef-
ficiency Council for the past four
years, he has worked for local
street improvement; currently, he
represents Davidson on the Char-
lotte/Mecklenburg Metropolitan
Planning Organization for trans-
portation.

“We are going through the
biggest change in Davidson,”
Mayhew said. “Bob Currie aptly
put it, ‘You couldn't stop in the
street and carry on a conversation
with your neighbor anymore.’”
Mayhew called the college. Inger-

and Talley Industries’ General
Time Instruments, Inc. major
local industries. He anticipates in-
creased effects of Lake Norman
development: “Davidson Landing
will make a big difference if those
people become year-round citi-
zens. They can march over to the
ballot box and change things.”

Asked to characterize David-
son as compared to other towns of
its size, Mayhew said, “What sets
Davidson apart as much as any-
thing else are the people. I don't
think I’ve ever seen anybody in
need. . . that wasn't helped.” He
cited townspeople’s donations of
toys and cash to needy local
families at Christmas; although he
can't remember how the custom
began Mayhew distributes the

gifts in costume.

Mayhew became involved in
helping Gene McEver and others
maintain a weekend concession
stand to raise funds for Davidson
Youth Baseball Program because

“We needed something to keep it

going and of course I like to cook
anyway . . . Gene always tried to
schedule the games to begin or
end at mealtimes.”

The concession stand helped
finance McEver Field which is lo-
cated on South Street and was
built and maintained without tax
money. The field is the site of the
State Pony League Champion-
ship.

At the Davidson Methodist
Church Mayhew currently chairs
the Official Board. He is a past
Master and Secretary of the
Davidson Masonic Lodge. During
his term as Postmaster, Mayhew
oversaw two building changes.
He worked for Charlotte
Wholesaler Allison Erwin before
becoming employed by the Post
Office; he also served a four-year
stint in the Army, stationed in At-
lanta, Korea, and Okinawa,
Japan. “One agreement | had with

sny wife when we married was
that as soon as I get out of this
man’s Army, we're going to
Davidson.” Mayhew and his wife
Joy have a son and a daughter and
one grandson.

When away from civic,
church, and home responsibili-
ties, Mayhew fly-fishes with En-
glish professor Frank Bliss in
nearby ponds. Mayhew said he
told Bliss, “I'll have to blindfold
you and swear you to secrecy re-
garding their fishing location. The
first time we went, he came out of
the house with a bag over his
head.”

“If you're going to live in a
town, you've got to pay your
dues, so to speak,” Mayhew said.
“I have a concern for the town; |
have a concem for the people. If
you've lived here as long as |
have, I think you'll feel that way
too."

feature spot-lighting different in-
dividuals in Davidson, whom stu
dents may pass in the street but
