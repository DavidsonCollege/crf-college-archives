The Eagles Soar Into Tequila Sunrise

By LEE HUDSPETH
(wie Staff Writer
Eagles—composed of
Don Henley, Glenn Frey, Ran-
dy Meisner, and Bernie
Leadon--produced their
second of three albums in 1973. ,
The theme of the album is well
expressed by its
do. ”

Songs like ‘‘Doolin-Dalton,”’
‘“‘Tequila . Sunrise,’’
“Desperado,” ‘Saturday
Night” and “Bitter Creek”
show us the sad and wistful
life of desperados in the old
West.

However, this record is
more than just a nostalgic look
at our heritage; the tales told
are all applicable today.

For example, ‘Doolin-
Dalton,’’ the first song on Side
One, tells of the lives of two
outlaws Bill Doolin and Bill
Dalton. The language
describes a dry and hopeless
land where “towns lay out
across the dusty plains, like
graveyards filled with tom-
bstones waiting for the
names.”

“Bitter Creek” is a song

this song is that of a lonesome

A paradox springs up here,
for are we in too deep if we live
the peaceful life of the far-

for living like desperados?
