WASHINGTON, D.C. (CPS)
—At the close of the last
session of Congress, the U.S.
Senate approved a
measure that would create a
new cabinet department, the U.
' S. Department of Education.
_ By a 72-11 vote, it gave the

new department—which would
centralize most federal educa-
tion programs under one admi-
nistrative roof —$14.6 billion
and 16,000 staffers.

But, in the end, the proposal:
was scuttled. Opponents in the
House of Representatives
' tacked over 100 amendments to
the proposal. The delaying tac-
tics worked.. When the 95th
Congress adjourned, there still
’ was no department of education

and the U. S. was still the only
industrialized nation in the
world without one.
~ Tt’s not for lack~of “trying.
) has considered over
120 proposals for adminstering
education programs -since the
1850’s. One of the few that was
actually passed was in 1954,
when the newly-created U. S.
Department of Health, Educa-
tion and Welfare (HEW) was
given authority over most’ go-
vernment school-related activi-
ties. Discontent with that ar-
rangement continues. Almost
inevitably, it’s expected to re-
sult in yet another bill for a
- Department of Education iii the
96th session of Congress, which
opens January 15.

‘Indeed, debate over the pro-
posal_is_expected_to dominate
education action on the Hill this

by the spring. But opponents
are equally optimistic. They
expect to pick up support
because of the ‘‘tax revolt,” and
the free-floating suspicion that
attends the creation of any new
bureaucracy.

Those opponents are worried
that centralizing all education
programs. under one roof ‘could
do more harm than good. For
example, James O'Hara, a lob-
byist with the American Fede-
ration of Teachers, is scared
that education would be isola-
ted in a new department, and
that, as the result, federal
funding will be harder to get.

Others say elementary and
secondary education would get
the most attention in a.depart-
ment, while higher education
would have a lower priority.

Some major research univer-
sities have announced a fear
that a centralized department
would only involve the federal
government more in all levels of
education— federal involvement
now is a source of escalating
concern—and would make
grants harder to get.

Representative Shirley Chi-
solm (D-NY) protested that the
proposal doesn’t guarantee in-
dependence for the office of civil
rights, and that it would dis-
rupt Indian education programs
by removing them from the
Bureau of Indian Affiars.

The ‘‘government control’’
issue, though, seems to be at
the heart of the opposition.

John Phillips, head of the

National Association of Inde-

pendent Colleges and Universi-
ties, is officially ‘‘undecided”
himself, but claims ‘growing
numbers of college presidents
are concerned about govern-
ment control.”’

Phillips fears ‘‘the depart-
ment (idea) tends to reinforce a
trend, and that’s why there is
reluctant to support it.” The
trend, says Senator Harrison
Schmitt of New Mexico, is
mostly toward ‘‘increased inef-
ficiency.’’

Yet a number of education
groups actively support the
idea. A seperate department
devoted to education would,

, according to the supporters,

finally make a coherent national
education policy possible.

John Ryor, president of the
National Education Associa-
tion, also sees less waste.
Administration costs could be
cut by centralizing education
programs, while giving educa-

tion. clout in the congres-
sional t process. At pre-
sent, points out Rufus Miles,

Senior Fellow at Princeton’s
Woodrow Wilson School, 40

‘agencies manage 300 education

programs, of which 200 are
outside HEW. Education it
thus the last agency within
HEW to get money.

Even then, Ryor adds, educa-
tion doesn’t get as much moneh
as it needs. The entire HEW
budget has quadrupled since
1968, but education expendi-
tures have only doubled. Edu-
cation currently gets only about
five percent of the entire HEW

How much food does it take to feed 1200 pigs? That’s what the
planners of the Progressive Pig-Out have been asking.
estimate that 1000 to 1200 students, faculty, and staff will
the campus-wide dinner this Friday.

In order to accomplish this massive culinary feat, an amazing
amount of cooperation and just plain hard work has taken place.

The idea was developed before Christmas, and a small committee
headed by David Barnard was formed which began hatching
schemes early in December.

They. have obtained the cooperation of the Patterson Court
houses (who will provide some of the food and most of the people),
ARA Slater and various independents and faculty wives in the
rounding-up of food.

In addition, large numbers of stidlecta will aid in serving the
various dishes, preparing the food, and, necessarily, directing the

w.
© courses of the meal will be served in the Union (hors
d'oeuvres in the 900 Room, dessert in the TV Loung and Morrison
Room), and the rest will be in Chambers (salad on the third floor,
soup on the second floor, and the-entree’in the Gallery), with at
least two serving areas in each place to speed the traffic flow.

Publicity chairman Weezie Mann, who brought a live pig onto
campus for advertisement, doesn’t anticipate any problems. “It's
all gone very smoothly so far. . ahs 37 cd
