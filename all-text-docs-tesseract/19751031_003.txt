Learning committee seeks
grade greivance process

.( SGA Senate report

By STEPHEN BELL
Staff Writer

The SGA Senate’s Commi-
tee on Learning has ironed out
the procedure whereby a stu-
dent may complain about a
grade he has received.

Last week, committee chair-
man Roger Brown met with
Dean of Students Will H.
Terry and acting Vice Presi-
dent Frontis Johnston in order
to have a complaint process
specified. Until Brown’s lob-
bying, no procedure had been
established, and each case of
complaint had been essentially
left to Terry’s discretion.

The procedure for a student
to complain about a grade now
begins with a meeting with the
professor involved. If the stu-
dent is unable to resolve the
problem with the professor
individually, he may ask for a
conference with the professor
and the dean of students.

If arbitzation with the dean
stili does not yield a solution,
the student may try to gene-
rate some pressure on the
professor to persuade him to
change the grade by going to
the department chairman,
then the academic vice-presi-
dent, and ultimately, the
president of the college.

However, no matter how
much support a student may
receive at these levels, no one
except the professor himself,
not even the president, can
have an unfair grade changed.

Brown cautioned that,
although this procedure will be
published in future editions of
the Wildcat Handbook, its
effectiveness depends on those
involved--especially the dean--
choosing to abide by it. It is
still not a part of the trustee
by-laws or faculty regulations.

According to Brown, ‘‘Both
(Terry and I) felt this would be
the best procedure. But it
would be nice to have it
established in one of the
faculty’s by-laws or regula-
tions.”

Brown received the support
of the Senate for the procedure
at the Senate meeting Tues-
day night. Also Tuesday
night, the Senate passed final
approval on an amendment to
its by-laws permitting suspen-
sion of the filing deadlines for
SGA elections in order to
lengthen the campaigning
period.

In the meeting of the pre-
vious week, the Senate passed
a resolution calling for a
student convicted of a crime to
have the option of referring his
case either to the dean of
students or to the student
hearing committee for the
decision on what disciplinary
action the school should take.

As it stands now, it is the
dean who has the option of
deciding the case himself or of
referring it to the Student

equipment.”’

“A three to five year plan is
needed,” said Terry, ‘‘so that
we can incorporate the costs of
these improvements gradually
into the budget.

“We have already compiled
an unofficial list of the im-
provements we would like to
see in equipment and services.
The first thing to do is to get
rid of those World War II beds
upstairs in the infirmary.”

Some of the equipment
needs on the list include a

Hearing Committee.

Also at the meeting of
October 21, the Senate turned
down a request from the
Biology Club for $200 in
support of the Biology lecture
series. The vote refusing the
request was 8-9, with three
abstentians.

Absent from the two
meetings were senators Eng-
lish, Roylance (2), Shewmake,
Sibley, Strange, and Weber.

antes for students, a
phone not connected to the
college’s switchboard, storm
windows, an elevator or dumb
waiter and a drainage system
to keep the basement from
flooding.

In the way of services the
list suggests the hiring of a
janitor, better support from
doctors on call at night, and a
better system for students to
get to the infirmary and check
in at the infirmary at night.

checking out the feasibility of
hiring more nurses for the
infirmary. As it now stands
there are three full-time and
one part-time nurse working
there up to 60 hours per week a

“If the physician the town
and college found had _ his
offices in the infirmary, he
would probably hire some of
his own staff,’’ noted Terry.

Finally, the plan, as the
trustees approved it, calls for
the raising of the student
health fee by up to $30, if
necessary, ‘‘to secure the fina-
ncial resources’’ to implement

the improvements recom-
mended.
Students currently pay

about $66 apiece, a rate Mc-
Farland has called ‘‘the lowest
I’ve ever seen.’ The rate
increase, as yeté undecided,
will take effect July 1, 1976.
