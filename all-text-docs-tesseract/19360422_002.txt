Pacific Militarist ....

Today some 35,000 students under the auspices
of the NSPA participate in their annual “peace
strike.” Tronically enough, most of the members
of Davidson's two lower classes celebrated this
“out-law war day" by pacifically cleaning their
rifles tor the government inspection !

THE DAVIDSONIAN joins with the
faculty and student body in extending

sincerest sympathy to Dr. M. E. Sentelle
in the recent loss of his father.

themselves about just what they are talking.

It is needless to discuss the merits of military
training here, where, in the first year after such
was made optional, the battalion showed
a larger enrollment than at any time in its history.
But we would like to point out that no other group
in the country is more opposed to war than the
army, and no other group has less voice in bring-
ing about a war.

The War Department is the machine which
fights the war. And the pleasant knowledge that
he will be among the first to get shot doesn’t in-
spire the average service man with urge to demand
an act of Congress authorizing him to go out and
die tor blood-thirsty fellow-countrymen. Don’t
misunderstand us; the members of the Army, O.
RC,
the contrary, they stand second to none in courage

and National Guard are not cowards, Quite
and intelligence. They merely are not as likely
to be misled by the propaganda’ which floods our
land whenever we seem about to become involved
in foreign military controversy.

Many of the peace strikers were motivated by
unquestioned sincerity, But we are tempted to feel
that-many more were swayed by the feeling of
mass activity which would impel the same strikers
to be among the first to rush to the colors, should
public opinion endorse such action.

Campus Comments
Dear Editor:

In answering the request to comment on. stu-
dent lite my mind runs to a topic in which I am
personally quite interested. I refer to the chang-
ing status of the freshman on the campuses of
\merican colleges and more particularly on our
own.

In the past we have been prone to underrate

the freshman as an individual and their class
|which is always’ the largest in the student
body. IEvery freshman who steps upon our cam-

pus ts not only a potential senior and alumnus, but
As

a man whose destiny we can help to shape.

| freshmen we respect and emulate those older than

So

the student body feels that a swimming |

pool is the most erying need of the Davidson cam- |

\

pus! No doubt the administration is enjoying @

hearty laugh at this! “Who will supply and-pay

for the water? What about the cost of heating
a pool in the winter? What about chlorination ?
Yesand the cost of lockers? Undoubtedly the |

nmst useless and expensive thing to keep up yet |

It wasn't even included in the build- |

ing program!”

suggested,

Maybe the fact that spring thas arrived had |
something to do with this choice. Yet we feel |

that it is significant that students chose three con-

we, but as upper-classmen we quickly lose sight

fot the influence we can weild over the freshman.

In most cases the attitudes instilled into a man
during his first year at Davidson determine his
conduct for four years and even for life.

With this thought in mind several groups on
the campus have suggested a plan for the election
of the Freshman Advisor in a slightly different
way than that used now. Instead of allowing the
freshmen to remain on the campus three or four
months before electing an Adviser themselves
trom the senior class, we suggest that in April
the members of O.D.K. place in nomination. the

tributions which would, have direct bearing of | names of several rising seniors, supplemented by

The in-
firmary was a close second, while the gymnasium
was not far behind. The importance of physical |

health as their three major preferences.

hygiene and sound health is increasingly realized |
as a factor of major importance in successful
living. It contributes not only to mental health,
but spiritual adjustment, as well.
corpore sano has increasingly become the goal
of the modern college.

Mens sana in |
|
!

Almost no other school of Davidson's size and |
rank fails to provide swimming facilities for its |
students. Next to golf and tennis no other sport |
has become so-universal, grown so popular. It pro-
vides an opportunity for building a well-developed
body; bringing in to play, as it does, almost all
muscles, jt affords well-rounded development.

Participation in inter-collegiate activities is nec-
essarily limited. With our present equipment
intra-murals cannot hope to meet the recreational
necds of all students. Besides we have facilities
of a limited nature, it is true, for almost all forms
of exercise save this one. ‘It is the one with
which the great majority are already familiar,
So our request for a swimming pool was not so
ridiculous as first appears!

Perhaps the alumni and college authorities will

nominations from the floor, and ‘that the rising
seniors elect this man. If this idea were used
it would mean that the Advisor could plan his
work during the summer, and be on hand to wel-
come the freshmen as they arrive. He could learn
to know them from the beginning, and act as their
class president for the whole year.

The man elected to this position will realize that

| his is the largest field for service on the campus.

His responsibilities will be second only to the
president of the student body, and the honor of
the position will be proportionate.

The procedure necessary to effect this change
is relatively simple, and I hope that we will be
able to see it go into operation next year.

Sincerely,

BOB LINDSAY,
P, S.—I request Woodrow Hassell, Captain
of C Company, to submit a letter for Campus

Comments for the next issue of The Davidsonian.

But
the lack of a swimming pool remains a glaring
deficiency in our school plant. Should the stu-
dents still want this next year, perhaps they,
you, we, all of us will have occasion to contribute
towards the filling of that need.

Dear Seniors:

In a few more weeks you graduate. Now comes the stern
realities of life. But you are prepared. Sheepskin in hand you
can look your prospective boss in the eye (of course, if you
enter your father’s business, it will be simpler) with confidence.

Fix him with that hypnotic stare (Psychology), grasp his
hand in the seeret handclasp (Chemical Fraternity), make a
pointed observation about the weather (Astronomy), be sure
to rattle off a “s'il vous plait” (French A) to show your com-
mand of foreign tongues, get off some-mouth filling phrase
(English 1), assure him that you can hear a letter (Business 8),
astound him with an obscure Biblical reference (Bible 1), cas-
ually mention that two and two are four (Math 1), and he is
in your power.

Should he be obstinate and fail to be amazed by such a
miracle of culture as a freshly-spewed Senior and hustle you
from his presence, do not be discouraged. Fell him with a gem
from your store of miscellaneous erudition by shouting that a
sonnet has fourteen lines or that Constantinople fell in 1453.
Then stalk away. If Philistine there are countless
others who are ready to swoon in the aurora of your person-
ality and wierd clothing combination,

reams of useless information at school—but you have acquired
a background and some worthwhile knowledge. Point ahead,
follow up your advantage and you may yet be worth a little
something. For goodness’ sake, do not think that you are the
messiah to a starved world because of a degree you haven't
even really earned. ;

To those seniors who believe that they are the Alpha and
Omega of wisdom and the quintessence of all success, I have
a final word, With your diploma—and a nickel—you may ride

When people up at Macalester

young man who teaches the course
in marriage problems, the professor
generally changes the subject hur-

Mr. ‘Cornell, you see, is a bache-

Mr. Cornell is strong for matri-
mony—for other people.

“Love? No one can fall intelli-
gently in love,” declared the pro-

“But professor, who wants to be

thing in his class of 35.
