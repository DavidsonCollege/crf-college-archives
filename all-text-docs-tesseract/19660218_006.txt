Stiffened Fingers Ripple .. .

Twain Returns To Life

By ALLEN WESB
Davidsonian Feature Writer
The American writer and hum-

orist Mark Twain became vig-
orously alive again Monday
night when Hal Holbrook gave
his one-man presentation “Mark
Twain Tonight’’ in Chambers
Auditorium.

Playing to a nearly full house,
Holbrook made an uncanny
transformation into the septua-
genarian Twain as he recreated
an actual tour performance the
author made shortly before his
death some 50 years ago.

Since the conception of the
idea of his solo show in 1953,
Holbrook has spent years per-
fecting his performance, visit-
ing friends of the author, study-
ing photographs of Twain in his
seventies and making every ef-
fort to keep his impersonation

DEVELOPMENT

“I did this character,” says
Holbrook explaining his decision
to play the role, ‘as part of a
two-person show I developed in
college. At the time I didn’t
know anything about Twain but I
reread Tom Sawyer and got in-
terested in his ideas."

ing required Vespers.

Timmons related that Rev.

vored doing away with Vespers

ice in chapel every other Thurs-

system would also be installed.

Terry’s plan has, however,
met with opposition from certain
faculty and administration mem-
bers.

Knight, chairman of the Student
Council Parking Committee, out-
lined a new parking ticket and
