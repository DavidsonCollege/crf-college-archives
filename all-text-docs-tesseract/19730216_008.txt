Horowitz Leads Wildcats Past Furman

Davidson Wins 89-84 As Horowitz Hits 31,
Team Approaches Sixth Conference Title

By CHARLIE SLAGLE
Staff Writer

Someone forgot to tell Larry
Horowitz that Furman was sup-
posed to dominate play near the
bucket. This oversight allowed
Davidson to move closer to its
sixth straight Southern Con-
ference regular season title by
beating the Paladins 89-84.

Many Davidson fans hope
that Horowitz remains ignored
for the rest of the games this
season.

Horowitz's 31 points. coming
off the bench. is a new scoring
high for the Wildcats this sea-
son and earned him a starting
role. But despite this Larry
was alone when one looked
for stars in this game.

John Falconi had a good night
adding 17 points along with a
good number of feeds to
Horowitz. which either resulted
in baskets or trips to the toul
line

Greg Dunn had another good
game with 16 points and tive
assists

The last star tor the Wildcats
would have to be Jay Powell
who with three minutes
remaining had not scored a
point and was playing just a fair
game

In those last three minutes
Powell managed to pick up
seven straight points while Fur-
man could only tally two

Each of these plavers deserve
credit. but last Monday night
belonged to Horowitz who must
be looking to take Eric Minkin’s

Davidson matmen practice their moves.

spot on the Jewish All-America
team.

Horowitz started off with a
bang when he was substituted
into the game after about three
minutes of play.

He scored 12 straight David-
son points and made a 10-5
deficit into a 17-14 lead.

By this point Horowitz could
do little wrong and at the halt he
had 18 points and had not
missed any of his five tield goal
attempts.

Horowitz continued his great
play in the second halt and two
of his 13 second halt points
came on a “Horrible” 20 toot
jump shot which proved he
could do little wrong

Despite all ot Horowitz's
heroics and most of Furman’s
big men in toul trouble the
Paladins stayed in the game.
and it was not until Powell's
scoring spurt that the Wildcats
could claim the victory

All the Cats need now ts a Vic-
tory over Appalachian to cap-
ture another Conterence ttle
and go into the tournament as
the number one seed

In the other game last week
Davidson beat The Citadel 85-
75. The word “game’™ is used
very loosely in this case as it
had to be one of the poorest
exhibitions of basketball ever to
be put on television

The most exciting thing which
happened all day was mascot
Dave Bender's high flving act
before the game. After that
everything seemed to ge

downhill.

Against the weak Bulldogs,
Davidson committed 24 first
half turnovers but still led at in-
termission 32-29 (that must be
some sort of record).

While “only” committing 13
turnovers in the second half the
Cats pulled away and even-
tually won by 10.

Horowitz. Dunn, T
Pecorak. Paul Wagner and
Falconi all scored in double
figures. Horowitz prepared for
his game against Furman by
pulling down 15 rebounds to go
along with his 18 points

Dunn also had 18 points while
T. Jay Pecorak and Wagner
had 16 and 12 respectively.
Falconi had nine assists to go
with his 11 points.

Jay

Jay Powell sat this game out
in order to make himself
eligible tor the Conterence tour-
nament. Jay had plaved in an
extra scrimmage while still on
the J.V.'s and had to miss a

game to make him eligible.

SHOOT IT THIS WAY
Horowitz goes up for a shot.

Rumors Of Team Dissention

By GORDON WIDENHOUSE

Criticism can sometimes be
very destructive

This is especially true with an
athletic team

Grapplers Rout Weak Pfeiffer

By JACK LINARD
Staff Writer

In a match that was so short
that many spectators were not
yet seated when it ended.
Davidson College's wrestling
team routed Pfeiffer College.
58-0.

The reason for the short match
was that Pfeiffer had only
four men on its wrestling team,
of whom three were pinned.

After Peter Hotchkiss and
Rob Jacobs picked up forfeits,
Rob Benton got an easy first
period pin by using his favorite
hold. the figure four on the
head

Jim Knights evened his dual

meet record at 2-2 with a major
decision on the only Pfeiffer
wrestler to last all eight
minutes of the match.

Dave Cormack received a for-
feit, and then John Kennelly got
a third period pin.

Randy Webster finished off
the night's wrestling: with
another first period pin.

“This match was entirely for
tun.’ mused Dave Cormak.

The next’ match would have
been even more fun because
UNCC has only two men on its
team.

It was canceled, more or less,
making the next appearance for
the grapplers the Southern Con-
ference meet next weekend.

The conference  cham-
pionships will be held in
Williamsburg, Va. on the 23rd
and 24th at William & Mary.

Davidson has a good chance
to take three medals in the
meet. Rob Benton in the 134 Ib.
class and Rusty Winchester at
142 Lb. represent the team’s
best chances. .

If John Scandling is healthy
again in time for the meet, he
stands a very good chance to
score inthe 150 Ib. division.

The team’s chances as a
whole are not so optimistic.
Coach Charles Parker expects
that Davidson should be able to
beat only Furman and The
Citadel in the meet.

73 basketball season. there have
been numerous .rumors ot
dissention and criticism ot the
style basketball Head Coach

Terry Holland has been em-
ploving
However. according to three

players. there is no dissention
on the team now

Mike Sorrentino, the junior
point man for the Wildcats. is
detinitely disappointed with the
performance the Wildcats have
shown thus tar.

He attributes this to the
“team as a whole, the players
as well as the coaches.

Sorrentino feels that the
team’s record could have been
as high as 22-0. “We could have
won all of our games.” the for-
mer Archbishop Maloy stand-
out said. ‘Everyone feels that
way. But the blame should not
rest on the coaches. Everyone
has made mistakes and we have
had a lot ot bad breaks.”

Captain John Pecorak ex-
plained the situation saying.
“Each player on this club is an
individual. It is really hard to
please everyone.

“At the beginning of the
season, there were probably ten
players that felt they should be
playing a lot.

“Everyone cannot play.
though. I think that everyone is
satisfied to just play as much as
they can and take it in stride if
they do not play a lot.” he ex-
plained.

“1 think Coach Holland main-
tains the best possible relations
with the players on the team,”
Pecorak continued. “He has ex-
plained the situation of having
so many good plavers to us and
we know that some of us cannot
play that much all the time.”

Pecorak went on to establish
the point that he felt there was

no dissention among the plavers

now.

“T think that our friendships
have grown and molded us
together as a unit.” he said.

Younger brother T. Jay was
with his brother and he agreed
with the elder’s analysis

“LT think that Coach Holland
has done the best job possible.
he said

“What people do not realize ts
that there are mostly high
school all-Americans or stand-
outs on this team. Not
evervone is going to be able to
play.’ he explained. ‘‘We have
learned that. with a bunch ol
good plavers. you have to think
of the team first.”

He went on to state that he felt
the losses the team had en-
countered thus tar were not the
tault of the coaches

Evidently there is very little
criticism trom the inside. No
doubt the win over) Furman
should keep morale high

The logical conclusion would
be to save the rumors tor a
more deserving occurance. [tis
quite clear that they are not
needed with the basketball
squad

Now itseems that the Wildcats
have not only the momentum
and the desire. but also the
team spirit to go after the
Southern Conterence Tour-
nament title as a unit

_The players feel that the at-
titude is right. It is time for the
tans’ attitudes to tollow. their
lead.
