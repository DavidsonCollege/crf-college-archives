The Honorable Stanford H.
Brookshire began with the “con-

‘Twenties. “Good morning.

accordingly with those involv-

ed.

The most predominant minor
offenses have included failure
to wear beanies, walking on the
grass, and failing to speak.

“Even though some. of the
regulations seem trivial. the
freshmen should try to take
them all seriously.” Stewart
said. He explained that, primar-
ily, the regulations are provid-
ed to mold the freshman into
the Davidson tradition and to
give them a sense of unity as
members of a class.

interview. Stewart indicated that
the Freshman. Court would try
at least 12 freshmen in its meet-
ing scheduled Wednesday. night.

“There will probably be
more than 15 appearing be-
fore the court when the re-

sults of Wednesday morning’s

freshman quiz are known,”

said Stewart. The writ was a
test on the Honor System,
alma mater, and officers o
the student government. :

While describing the Fresh-
man Court’s latest indictments
and the freshman attitude,
Stewart also emphasized that
the present. court penalties are
not the same that the old Fresh-
man Court of Control used to
impose.

Rather than allow the violator
to “show off” in front of the
freshman class, the court now
requires that he submit to ob-
secure, menial jobs as penance
for his offense.

Vagabonds Spotlight
Set Of Props

BY TOM.LOFLIN
Davidsonian Feature Writer

The Vagabonds will revive an old Egyptian custom
<ome next Tuesday night with the opening of The Man
Who Came To Dinner.

During the last act, a burial
of sorts, will be performed on
stage, complete with a mummy
case and all the trimmings.

The “trimmings,” by the way,
will mainly consist of the not-
so-shriveled mummy played by
Mrs. Laura Ann Stevens who
will wear a rather “sexy dress,
as Don Stowell, assistant direc-
tor of dramatics, puts it. The
rites will be rather simple and
very humorous, according to
Stowell.

Stowell also hinted that the
audience might do well to
come equipped with DDT or
other pest eradicators due to
the fact that a crate of roaches
is included in the props. Four
penguins will also be needed,
but the Vagabonds admit thet
stuffed ones will be used to
keep Peter Stuart Ney !V
from getting an inferiority
complex.

Just in case you're wondering
by now exactly what kind of a
thing will go on at the Fine Arts
Building from Tuesday through
Saturday nights beginning at
8:30 p.m., Stowell’s advice . is
to come and see.

“Actually The Man Who
Came To Dinner is a funny,
funny three act play that has
hed more than ifs share of
success since it was first pro-
duced on Broadway in 1939,”

last appeared with that group
in 1957 in The Desperate Hours,

In fact, in 1942, he played
the same role with the Little
Theatre thet he now has with
the Vagabonds. Pitts also
served as Entertainments Edi-
tor with the Charlotte Obser-
ver for 16 years.

The penurious in the aud-
jence will be pleased to see
their heroine Louise Sloan in a
maid’s costume instead of in
the library basement scanning
the Stock Market reports. “She's
real funny and does her part
quite well,” Stowell compli-
mented her.

There won't be any fake
British accents when Bever-
ly Carlton, an English play-
wright, enters. The Vagabonds
have found a real Englishman,
Richardson Scholar Goeffrey
Luckock, to give forth with
that horribfe vernacular.

To try to persuade the ad-
ministration of the true worth
of drama on the campus, the
Vagabonds will also sponsor a
discussion on the “nature of
laughter.”

No faculty leader has yet
been obtained, but debate will
begin at 7:30 p.m. every night
the play is given, except Fri-
day.
