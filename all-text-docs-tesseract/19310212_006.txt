Book Review

Mata Harvi. By Major Thomas: Coulson.
Harper & Brothers, publishers, New York. |
1930. 312 pp.

“In your soul and in your conscience are |
you convinced that this woman is guilty of |
having communicated information and docu-
ments to the enemy, and.having caused the |
death of many of. our soldiers?”

Very calmly and without hesitation each
officer replied, “Yes.”

As the sentence of death was read to her
that pleasant June evening, did Mata Hari,
notorious German war spy, hear from the
shades of desolation and terror the trampling
of ghostly feet, as a phantom army paraded;

that group of fifty thousand men who had |

been sent to their death as the direct result
of her treachery.

From early in 1914 the Red Dancer and
her partner, Death, strode together from
stage to stage. From early in the morning
of the 10th day of June, 1917, Death alone,
smiling grimly, continued the way.

Many legends have been woven around the
almost magic name of Mata Hari. A pupil
of Marie Anne Lesser, this girl of Dutch
descent became one of the most dangerous
of enemy spies.
not unaware of her actions. Yet they were
powerless,
Hari were to be found ambassadors,
ing officers, and some of the highest offi-
cials of France, Spain, and other countries.
In anguish the intelligence department
sought definite and conclusive evidence by
which they might convict. It remained. for
the woman to betray herself through -her
vanity.

In a clear-cut authoritative fashion Major
Coulson reveals the true facts about Mata
Hari. Romance, glamour, legénd—all are laid
aside and a cold directness used. Apparently

the author is in a position to speak with a/

certainty rising from sure knowledee, clse
much he says would have to be omitted.
The book is only fairly well writtea, but
because of, the nature of the subject, the
reader is pale spellbound from a to coyer.

England and France were |

for among the lovers of Mata)
rank- |

| of another musical season. The
| of the chapter who heard you are all en-
_ thusiastically

of the books in the long and honored list of
this popular travel-writer.

We shall take for granted the fact that
| Americans are generally in ignorance of the
| true life in the Scandinavian countries. We
| have come to think of these countries as
merely possessing beautiful scenery, and are
| almost in complete ignorance of the peoples
| themselves. Harry Franck does much in this
| book to correct this impression. With his
genius for making friends among strange
| people, he’ goes among the Scandinavians
/and comes back with a story which is filled
| with understanding. He has gone to the
quaint little hamlets of these people. and
has emerged with powerful impressions of
the true Dane, the true Swede, and the true
Norwegian.

His adventure has been called an adven-
ture of the spirit rather than an adventure
of the flesh. Those who merely seek infor-
| mation will receive much enjoyment from
the book as well as those who wish to spend
time in this umost interesting part of the
| world.

appearing in concerts and re-
citals in all of the large musical centers.
Probably the most famous church that he
appeared in was St. Peters in the Vatican in
Rome. At this church he played several re-
citals and they were greatly enjoyed by his
audiences. The organist of this great church
wrote of Mr. Seibert’s playing that, “Great-
er sentiment could not have been expressed.
The technique of which you have manifested
mastery is worthy of praise.”

Last season Mr. Seibert appeared before
the Buffalo Chapter, American Guild. of
Organists, in St. Paul’s Cathedrah. The
dean of the Guild, DeWitt C. Garretson,
wrote to Mr. Seibert, “Your recent recital

Three
Sons,

Titans. Emil Ludwig. Putnam’s
New York, 1930. 356 pp. $3.50.
Michelangelo, Rembrandt, and Beethoven—
Three Titans. Look at;the three heads and
you have the daemonic affinity. _
Michelangelo receives by far the most sat-

isfying treatment. One is at once fascinated |
and charmed’ when this first chapter is fin-|

ished, and it is with genuine eagerness that
one looks to the second and third. The life
of the famed sculptor is slowly traced from

earliest childhood. Many seemingly. insigni- |

ficant details are brought in to lend strength
to the portrait. It is noticeable throughout
that Ludwig has a way of bringing out the

greatness of his subjects by a subtle under- |

rating or disaparaging of contemporaries.
This method is successful here, for certainly |
his Titans seem supreme.

In the study of Rembrandt, Ludwig seems’!
to picture a man who became a master in|

spite of himself, Rembrandt strove for lux- |

ury, but found it only part of the time.
Though much of his life was filled with |

misery, he seems supremely happy. His over- |

indulgence in the baser things of life per-
haps accounts to some extent for the un-
usual amount of the grotesque found in his
works.

One does not feel a full satisfaction from
the treatment of Beethoven. Truly a Titan,
the. great composer rises above his environ- |
ment. He cannot be held down. The slight-
est interference may send him into fits
of rage. The criticism of this man is too
mechanical; it seems to lack true musician-

ship. One feels as if the story was being |

forced in order to obtain a certain effect.
Graphically the passing of this famous
composer is described. Lying unconscious,

Beethoven is roused for a moment by a ter- |

rific clap of thunder. Struggling to a sitting
position, he turns to his friends and says,
“Plaudite, amici, comoedia finita est,” then
shaking his fist at the elements he cries out
in anguish and slowly sinks back—dead.
On closing the book one might perhaps
ask if these characters are not demi-gods.
The answer will be—no, not gods, but rather
three Titans who accepted battle with the
gods. A. R. J.

A Scandinavian Summer. By ‘Harry A
Franck. The Century Company, publishers.
New York. 1931.

Harry Franck has spent twenty-five years
of his life traveling in tropic and semi-tropic
countries. This “Prince of the Vagabonds”
decided to cool off for a season in Europe’s
far north. He decided to, go to Scandinavia.
He came back with this book which is fresh
with bouyancy. It is as eye-opening as any

heard him was in the Town Hall in New
York. Prof. Cullum was so impressed with
his playing that he promised Mr. Seibert
an engagement at-Davidson.

The following “are some of the impres-
sions that he gave where he played:

“Recital. stupendous in  appeal.”—New
York Sun.

“Organ played in such a way. has heen
a revelation.”.—La Perseveranza, Milan,
Italy. ;

“Tt was the best.’—‘“Never heard more
finished work.”—“Seibert is the best.”

Three More Games

For Freshman Quint

Will Meet Carolina N. C. State, and
Charlotte Hi, This Month

Three more games remain on .the David-
son Freshman basketball schedule. The)
Wildkittens have yet to meet the yearlings
of both Carolina University and State Col-
lege, and the Charlotte Hi five. Last Tues- |
day they met a strong Presbyterian Junior
College quintet, but the outcome was not
known at press time.

The contest with the Carolina Freshmen |
will be played on Thursday, the 12th, at}
Chapel Hill, as a preliminary to the Varsity- |
Carolina game. This foe, since they have |
subdued everyone they have met, promises |
to be the toughest the Wildkittens will en- |
counter. On the following night, the 13th, |
the Kittens journey to Raleigh, where they |
meet the State yearlings in another prelim- |
inary to the Varsity game. The State Fresh- |
men also have a strong team, having been |
defeated only once during the season, that |
loss being administered by the Duke Fresh. |

On the 20th the Wildkittens close their |
season by meeting the strong Charlotte Hi
quintet on the Davidson court. This game
will be the second meetings between the two |
teams, the high school winning the first on |

the Charlotte-eetrrt-by a 27-18 score. |

Duke 27—Davidson 18
The Davidson Wildcats dropped their
first Big Five game on Tuesday night, Feb-
ruary 3, to the fast-stepping Duke Uni-
versity quint by the score of 27-18. The
Blue Devils, playing before a big crowd of
| home fans, were met on even terms by the

| Wildcats in the first half, but pulled out in
| front in the last half.

George Rogers, Duke forward, opened the

| scoring in the first minute by sinking a long
‘shot from the right side of the court. The

game then went scoreless for nine minutes
before Goodson found the basket and _ tied

| the score, 2-2. Duke held the lead through-

| out the game except for a few minutes of
the first half after Martin had looped in
a field goal to give his team a 7-6 lead.
Duke guard, countered with a field
goal and thereafter Duke was in the lead,
leaving the floor at.the half with the slight
lead of 12-11.

In the

%.

second half the work of Shaw

|} and Rogers enabled the Blue Devils to forge

lead which was not
threatened during the rest of the game.
Shaw of Duke was high point man of the
night with a total of 13 points, marking up
four field goals and five fouls. He was fol-
lowed by Martin, Davidson center, who
scoed four field goals for a total of eight

| points.
