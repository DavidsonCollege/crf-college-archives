College Union Sponsors ‘Celebrate Women Day’

By SARA BEASLEY

The Union patio was the site
of a considerable range of activity
Wednesday afternoon. “Celebrate
Women Day!” was sponsored by
the Women’s Concerns Commit-
tee, the Rape Committee, and the
Union Patio Committee, and fea-
tured a variety of entertainment
and information. Among the
booths arranged around the patio
were Davidson’s Women’s Athle-
tics, a collection of music and lit-
erature by women, a table for
making Mother's day cards, as
well as information about birth
control and rape. The May Pole,
created from an ordinary lamp
post, was the center of a celebrat-
ory dance ritual. The Patio was
decorated with carnations every-
where and
from the tree.

In keeping with a theme of va-
riety in womanhood, the celebra-
tion offered an entire program of
entertainment and enlightenment.
Susie Myers acted as emcee and,
in good cheerleading fashion,
twice led the responsive crowd in
spelling out “W-O-M-E-N.”

The Davidson Gospel Choir
started the afternoon's festivities
with “God Has Smiled On Me.”
Pianist and Assistant Choir Direc-
tor Dee Perry said: “It is a beauti-
ful day and we have each other.
Our song, ‘Happy,’ reflects these

streamers hanging

Thanks Bill, Living Off
Campus Wont Be That Bad

feelings.” After the Gospel Choir
sang, the Girl Scouts of Troop 382
performed several selections. The
Girl Scouts, led by Judy Redd,
Paige Dalton, and Linda Higbie,
performed “We Are the World.”
Young participant Kebe Springs
exclaimed, “I had a good time!”
Other musical contributions in-
cluded Alva Moore's soaring sop-
rano voice in “You Make Me Feel
Like a Natural Woman.

Lauren Smith read several of
Davidson's Dance Troupe, led by

Paulette Kurani: “The dance was
provocative, too.”

Also provoking enthusiasm
were skits directed by Roxanna
Guilford. “Roxy’s Players” per-
formed memorable dialogues to
illustrate the differences (and the
similarities) between the sexes. In
a skit written by Rob Reiner,
Mark Swift and Elizabeth Winter-
mute acted out two babies learn-
her poems, especially those which
focused on different aspects of
womanhood. Janet Stovall also
read some of her poetry, inviting
both sexes to reconsider their re-
lationships with each other.
Senior John Syme said that he
“enjoyed the poetry especially,
simply because it was provoca-
tive... I'm glad we had this
May Day to raise awareness about
women’s issues.’’ Syme also re-
marked on the performance by

ing to distinguish between boy
and girl characteristics.

Rusk Scholar Sophie Manham
offered this perspective on the
events of the day: “It’s a good
idea. I'd like to see a lot more of it.
Women don’t seem to talk about
being a minority, except among
themselves. As somewhat of an
outsider on campus, I have
noticed a rather patriarchal envi-
ronment in Davidson. I worry that
this May Day celebration has been
specially packaged. It should stem
naturally.” Coach Patty Daley
commented that, “It is about time
and it is wonderful!” Missy
Kuykendall remarked, “I am de-
lighted that Davidson students are
doing this.”

Sonie Wood read some of her
stories and Karen Jones-Meadows
contributed to the finale of the af-
ternoon’s events with the reading
of her own poetry. The afternoon
ended with the crowd of students,
community members, children,
faculty and staff dispersing reluc-
tantly, clasping carnations and
crayoned Mother's Day cards

The celebration was the
brainstorm of Mary Jo Clark and
Pam Strader, was organized by
Ellen Papadeas, and was overseen
by Women’s Concerns Commit-
tee Melissa Jones and Union exec-
utives Ruth Pittard and Elizabeth
Smiley. Mary Jo Clark summed
up by saying, “I thought it was

wonderful. The age range of the
talent was remarkable. It was a re-
ally festive occasion; an opportu-
nity to think about the issues and
have a real fun time. We ought tc
make it an annual event.” Reli-

Students perform at “Women’s Day” celebration.

gion Professor William Mahony
added: “I can't think of a more ap-
propriate day than May |. It is an
archaic day for celebrating the
feminine cosmos.”

A less popular person on campus this
time of year is none other than Director of
Housing Bill Bolding. As of Thursday, the
waiting list for on-campus rooms was
fluctuating around 100. Naturally, those
displaced souls — and their parents —
need something (or someone) upon which
they can vent their frustrations. Yes, these
days, Bolding is everyone's favorite
punching bag, as it were.

DRUNK

By DAVID McGEE

My roomate, senior David Snyder,
would gladly relish attaching Bill Bolding
to any ceiling should anyone care to excise
their anxiety just as Muhammad Ali
would. Snyder hasn't lived in a dorm since
his freshman year. He and senior Steven
Bernhardt were forced off campus their
sophomore year due (unfortunately!) to
Steven’s astronomical room-lottery
number that he drew that year.

Having close to the highest number in
the entire lottery doesn’t quite put one on
first Watts or in a Duke single. In addition
to David’s mediocre draw, the closest to

campus the two were destined to live was,
at best, the trailer park behind the Buttery
& Beanery. With tears in their eyes, David
and Steven immediately entered the off-
campus housing market.

Their first stop was a house (which we
now fondly call the monastery) not far
from where David and I have lived for the
past two years. Steven and David cordially
met their potential landlady in her parlor.
“This isn’t such a bad place,” they
thought.

Just before they saw the downstairs
apartment however, the owner stopped at
the basement door and announced, “‘l
might as well tell y'all now that I don't
allow smoking, drinking, or any girls. |
don't want to worry about what's going on
down there.”

Steven, after a quick glance at David,
said, “We'll take a look at it anyway.” For
those of you frantically searching for a
place to live next year, off-campus living
can actually be a real joy. Later, you
might even thank Bill Bolding for booting
you out of the dorms. Well, maybe not.
Anyway, I haven't missed living in a dorm
for one nanosecond. | haven't missed, for
instance, the indigenous piles of muddied.
mildewed, and beer-stained shoes, pants,
shirts, and jock straps — left to rot in the
hall — from that game of mudball last
week.

Or the shower that you share with 30
other people, for that matter. Or that sorry
excuse for a primate who surrounds his
three-day Humes paper binge with his
pizza box collection in the hall lounge.

Yes, the Sunday morning strolls through

weekend.

knee-deep ilk (beer cartons, old Charlotte
Observers, wads of brown laundry paper,
football gear, and other assorted grunge)
to the fungus and human-hair crested
shower are now forgotten memories.

Just once, | wish someone would
knock on my door at 2 a.m. and ask to
borrow the phone and apologize for (this
used to just kill me) — waking me up. But
don't be disillusioned. Living off campus
does have its hazards.

There is always the temptation to study

in complete peace and quiet. Along with
that goes all the nights you'll sleep
soundly — uninterrupted. The tons of
privacy you suddenly find yourself with
can become quiet a burdon if you're not
careful.

You may just have to live through the
times when your landlord goes to
Singapore for a month, leaving the house
to yourself and the Party Squad. So,
despair not, evicted of Davidson! There's
