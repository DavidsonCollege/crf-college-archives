The establishinent of a unit ‘of the
Reserve Otiicers’ ‘Vraining Corps at Da-
vidson has at last become an actuality.
Last Monday the students expecting to

checome members ot the unit were meas-

ured. for uniforms, and close order drill
is being taken up this week.

A number of inquiries have been made
about the R. OQ. ‘F.C. and this article
hepes to answer some of them.

To begin with, one hundred: thou-
sand complete uniforms, and one hun-
dred thousand sets of infantry equip.
ment, including rifles, ammunition, ete.
are available and held subject to orders
of the R. O. T. C. committee. So there
is no need to fear a shortage. of uni-
forms. It has not been definitely stated
by the War Department but it is thought
that these. uniforms will be given as per-
manent property.

‘To receive the comiiutation of 40
cerits per day a preliminary course of
two years’ military work is. required.
The equivalents of this course which it
is hoped will be adopted are:

1, Service as a commissioned officer
of the United States.

2. ‘Three months’ service as an en-
listed man with combat troops in France
or Italy.

3. Four months in the service of
supply, in training camps or schools in
Europe.

4. Six months in cantonments in the
United States.

Service in the §. A. T. C. may count
month for month as equal to service in
the R. O. T. C. in the two years’ pre-
liminary course to the advanced train-
ing.

Members of the Naval Reserve (in-
active’status) are not eligible under pres-
