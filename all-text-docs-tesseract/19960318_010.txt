Stress

Jazz Ensemble im-
presses small crowd .

By Nick Paut
Staff Writer

In a rare opportunity missed
by almost the entire Davidson stu-
dent body, the lost art of jazz
ensemble was performed in the
900 Room just prior to Spring
Break by the Johnson C. Smith
Jazz ensemble.

Unlike the solo or small group
jazz performances that are more
prevalent in our day and age, the
jazz ensemble consists of a larger
group of mostly brass instruments.
With their mellow blues highlights
and soft jazz beat, the group pro-
vided an excellent atmosphere to
escape from the pressure of mid-
terms and packing.

I am not an authority on jazz
music, but! found myself in excel-
lent company with our ex-SGA
president Bill Gullan, who has his
own radio show dedicated to this
genre, on my left. On my right was
blues connoisseur Jason Ferris
whose foot tapping and rapt atten-
tion were a testament to the quality
of the performance.

The musicians found their
roots in many different states across
the U.S. and their renditions of
some of the Jazz Era greats were
excellent. I guess my moment
came at the last tune, a personal
favorite, “Ride the A”

I would like to express my
thanks to this group for making
Davidson the last stop on its tour
and my contempt for those who
failed to advertise the event and
thereby denied Davidson students
some damn fine jazz.

brings the gang to town

Love, peace, and harmony. The
jolly folks from Eddie From Ohio
played to a packed 900 Room last
Monday. Legs dangled from the
balcony and people sweated to the
standing-room-only mob.

My first glimpse of the band
proved that they were a fun group.
Robbie, who looked like the direc-
tor of the youth group at church,
was hopelessly balding and fright-
eningly zealous in his guitar play-
ing and vocals. Squirrel-cute Julie
was equally enthusiastic, slapping
her sides to the beat while smiling

and singing perkily. Long-haired
Mike also supplied vocals, com-
edy, guitar and the occasional har-
monica. The namesake of the band,
drummer Eddie, was the most seri-
ous and least talkative as he slapped
away at his leisure. Eddie spoke
through the drums, providing an
orgasmic, prolonged drum solo,
finishing-up by slapping the flanks
and neck of Robbie’s guitar.

The crowd loved the show.
Students danced, swayed, shared
gorp, and called for requests. The
three males’ voices blended like a
barber shop quartet, while Julie’s
sweet voice serenaded.

It was a toe-tappin’, thigh-

slappin’, acoustical rhythm good
time.

The Grateful Dead influence
was obvious. They don’t try to
hide this fact, for they appropriate
the Dead’s skull image on their t-
shirts. To the audience’s delight,
along with playing original mate-
rial, they covered happy tunes like
the Indigo Girls’ Closer to Fine ,
Lyle Lovett’s /f ] had a Boat, and
an unidentifiable James Taylor
gem. Most exciting was their
acoustic rendition of Motley Crue’s
classic glam anthem Shout at the
Devil.

As aifavorite among students,
the band promised them a good

time. .Toward the end of the set,
they played the tunes of popular
T.V. shows like Green Acres and
The Brady Bunch. To pay their
respects, they cutely changed the
lyrics of Green Acres to “Davidson
is where I’d like to stay.”

The show was all about fun.
The players love what they are
doing, and it was obvious that they,
would have played all night if
asked. During the final tune, Julie
exclaimed, “We don’t know how
to get out of this song!”

Whenall the metallic rhythms
and booty-shakin’ beats were over,
the crowd left elevated and happy.

It’s great to be alive, man.

Book Review

Traveling Europe on 84¢ a Day

By Pau. -Ropert PALMER
Guest Writer (The Brock Press)

Most copies of Gil White’s
Europe on 84¢ a Day will no doubt
become well-traveled and dog-
eared as their owners use them to
navigate Europe and employ his
advice.

“I simply plucked the ‘84¢’
out of the air to drive home the
point that you don’t need thou-
sands of dollars to go to Europe,”
explains the author. ‘Too many
students try to measure their fun by
how much money they can spend
rather than budgeting and explor-
ing the country creatively.”

White’s formula for reducing
major expenses is simple: the trav-
eler should possess enthusiasm, an
interest in meeting the people, trust
in people, and more importantly,
the willingness to return the hospi-
tality by performing simple chores
such as, washing dishes, baby-sit-
ting, milking cows or by offering

gifts such as stamps, t-shirts or
cassette tapes. This ‘trade-off’ al-
lows the traveler not only to reduce
the costs, but more importantly
gain greater insight and understand-
ing of the people and the country.

Europe on 84¢ a Day is back
by popular demand, revised and
updated for the ‘90s and is the most
creative and adventurous travel
book to come along in years —
unlike other travel books that offer
only the nuts and bolt of travel
(hotel and restaurant addresses,
museum opening times).

The author also presents many
methods that female travelers can
employ to stay safe, while still
having as much fun as the guys.
Among his precautions are taking
advantage of university ride boards,
cycling, or using companies that
arrange rides for you.

“The biggest mistake you can
make is to buy a Eurail pass for the
entire trip. Take the trains and stay
in youth hostels for the first three

weeks and as you gradually gain
confidence, branch off into my
more creative ideas,” says the au-
thor.

He recommends leaving your
options open, cycle one day, hitch
the next, take a train or bus, camp,
stay in vacant hotel staff rooms or
with a farmer, or a university stu-
dent. Some of his most useful
travel tips are truly entertaining
and insightful which will provide
the best memories of your trip.
Imagine getting rides by using
“You’re on the Air” (being on a
radio station) method, the ‘New
Wave-Switch-Over,’ the ‘Wrong-
Sign-Right-Road’ method, and
even ‘Yacht-Hiking’ along the
French Riviera.

By covering 36 countries
(Western and Eastern Europe, the
Middle East, and North Africa),

the author provides information:

on places you might not expect to
travel. He offers practical tips on
what to take, and for each country,

White provides the best festivals,
best scenery, the must-see tourist
sights, night life, history, and pe-
culiar customs. The author says
traveling can sometimes be over-
whelming and by providing the
‘best’ of the country, the student
can plan the day better if he or she
is pressed for time. Actually, the
book is two books in one, with the
listing of over 3,000 youth hostels
and their telephone numbers — all
located on over 130 country and
city maps.

Indispensable are the tradi-
tional phrases in 20 languages, as
well as the specific. phrases for
getting accommodations, food, or
rides.

“You may be too tired to cycle.
to the next town, so open the book
to the phrases in German which
explain to the farmer you would
like to work for a few hours in
exchange for a bed, two meals and
