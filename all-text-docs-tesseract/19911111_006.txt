... Europeans tend to pooh-pooh
an American preoccupation with
ethics in general, and an elected
official‘s failure to possess any in
particular. Rather condescend-
ingly, the more ’sophisticated“ of
our European allies think that we
presentan interesting and amusing
example of Judeo-Christian hypoc-
risy at work. Perhaps we might be
grateful not to: be so worldly.
Blessedly free of such inhibitions,
in England it was rumored that
normally liberal publishers in the
scandal sheet trade secretly sup-
ported John Major for Prime Min-
ister precisely because they could
envision headlines like "Major
Cock Up,“ or "Major Screws
Again.“

Where Italian governments fall
faster than autumn leaves, what
seems an astonishing breach of
trust by President Nixon is merely
acurios foible to the likes of Edith
”Gaffe“ Crésson, France‘s former
foreign minister. Imagine Jeanne
Kirkpatrick declaring that all Ca-
nadian men were gay (tell that one
to Janet Jones, Wayne Gretzky‘s
wife), but American men were not.
In the first place, scandals past
would immediately invalidate the
claim (Q: Why won‘t the Library
of Congress let Senators check out
any more books? A: They kept
bending over the pages (Dah-
Dump-Dump)). But there is also
the feeling that to make such a
spurious claim would be somehow
disingenuous and lacking in hu-
mility. In fairness were itrevealed
that Ms. Kirkpatrick had some per-
sonal interest in that respect, no
amount of attention would be
spared in aneffortto bring to public
view all the relevant facts.“

Hence, theanguish with which
Americans (in general) balance
their taste for the lurid and the bold
with an almost apologetic unease

that seeks to expiate the guilt they’

feel. Would Clarence Thomas have
received so much attention had it
been startlingly exposed that a
limited partnership with which he
was involved had committed po-
tentially criminal tax code viola-
tions? In fact, a Post revealed on
Nightline the same day as the Anita
Hill scandal began to break that
Thomas had two separate liens

Where was the outrage? Which
allegation do you remember more
vividly? It is difficult to imagine

“the Three Bigs (Geraldo, Sally

Jessie and Oprah (sorry Phil)) de-
tailing Justice Thomas‘ tax prob-
lems with as much relish as the
Anita Hill story and all the associ-
ated titillations.

Yet, through itall, every single
pontificating individual who man-
aged to squeeze in front of a cam-
era, or type out a line of print was
denouncing the process,“ pre-
sumably because it was so dis-
tasteful. If reverse-discrimination
is David Duke‘s code word for the
nostalgia for good old-fashioned“
discrimination, then, quite possi-
bly, the ’process“ that critics were

decrying entailed its seaminess far -

more than its perceived unfairness
to either party.

Literally for years, the hints,
suspicions, and outrightrevelations

about the S&L crises floundered .

on the economic pages where bad
(read: ’boring“) news goes to die.
But let the President‘s son be
implicated, and suddenly the
movement has a ”Poster Boy.‘
Never mind that deregulation de-
signed by the White House, smil-
ingly assented by the Congress,
and gleefully implemented by

inexperienced and only occasion- —

ally crooked: bankers was more
probably the cause. Should asmok-
ing gun and an open mouth reveal,
in the words of Charles Keating,
that, hell yes he bought influence,
then suddenly the Congress gets
theirs aswell...

~ ~"“‘We are saddened that our rep-
resentatives felt at liberty to write
themselves small (and not-so-
small) interest free loans in the
form of checks. But we are out-
raged that you, the American tax-
payer, would for so long ignore the
three trillion dollar loan, hardly
interest free, that the bums felt free
to write in all of our names ”with
the full faith andcreditof the United
States of America.“

Who do you think is going to
pay that bill? Not Ronald Reagan
and Tom Foley. They‘ll be dead.
There‘s just us, the surviving
American taxpayers, whose real
household wages just topped the
1973 mark. Think about that as
you turn past the economic page to
check on the color of that bra. Hey,

that! Hey, while he‘s up there ask

him how he plans to fund the

Unemployment Compensation

Act. He‘ll probably tell you to tack

iton the deficit. You want scandal
. . that’s scandal.

You want finger-pointing and
demagogic blame to take away the
sting of enjoying A Current Affair
so much, at least make yourself
useful. Direct your blame at the
real problems this country faces.
And when you blame people, as
you surely will, blame them fornot
providing a means of securing
adequate housing for the millions
of Americans whocannotafford it.
Or blame them for the fifty or sixty
percent ofhigh-school seniors who
graduate semi-literate and not good
for anything. Or, better yet, don‘t
even bother to blame; identify the
problem and attempt a construc-
tive solution. Moral failings are
indicative of our humanity and are
thus excusable; failure to act
humanely transcends immorality
and cannot be excused. -

And here‘s where this little
tirade fits into your miserable lives.
Apparently certain tidbits of cam-
pus life revolving around Patter-
son Court have offended various

_ membersofthecommunity. While

we certainly do not advocate be-
grudging the rights of the individ-
ual (even the infantile and gutless
ones who urge us all to rot in hell,
but don‘t bother to give us the
satisfaction of knowing whocursed
us to such an insensitive fate), we
can expect more of certain indi-
viduals. ,

~ Sexism and bigotry i is clearly
inexcusable and inhumane. Pass-
ing off obviously prejudiced and
ridiculous antics as non-offensive
in origin because of a *humorous‘“
motivation is clearly no defense.
Viewing and presenting any hu-
man as intrinsically lower‘ than
another human is wrong. While

we can acknowledge an individ-’

ual’s right to express any position
they hold, we need not respect or
excuse the idiotic. :

So, scrawlers of swastikas and
creators of sex kittens feel free to
dabble in the offensive; it is your
inalienable right, But don‘t deny
society the opportunity to prove
that itcan still respect humanity by
denouncing your acts of artistic

aggression.

our problems to just disappear if
we all sit around and think about
rainbows. It just seems we can
find other ways to work together,
rather than letting tension and ani-
mosity get the best of us. We’ve
gottoomuch to giveto the worldto
be so negative all the time. Ideal-
istic? Maybe. But, really, what’s
so wrong with looking for the bright
side? Why does constructive criti-
cism have to be negative?

Finally, I must close by ad-
dressing Ms Player and Ms Hollo-

man. Do you two know Tom |
Koonce? As a personal friend of.

Tom’s, I, along with many others,
felt extremely offended, hurt, and

outraged upon reading your cal-

lous comments.

__ Maybe you-two just had a bad

day or something; I don’t know.

Your cruel comments were com-
pletely unnecessary and unfair. I
suggest you go meet the guy, and I
think you’ll understand.

~ One Davidson student says, “I
was under the impression that I
was only signing as an advocate of
their [homosexual] civil rights. I
didn’t know that I was signing in
support of an organization on this
campus ... 1 don’t know what’s

_ going on.” Behind this voice there

may be many others who are
equally misinformed about this
moral issue. Students need to be
made aware of all the facts and

allowed to make an educated deci-
sion. Without a campus wide ref-
erendum we will never know ex-
actly how the issue stands; thus
responsibility lies with the leaders
of the eating houses, fraternities,
independents, and freshmen. A
closed ballot should be demanded
to deter the peer pressure which
was previously involved. :
Davidson College was founded
on, and should continue to exer-
cise the Christian values estab-
lished in 1837. Itwould beashame
to see the standards that have been
upheld for so many years eat away
at the moral fiber of the Davidson
College community. -' Davidson

College has heard from the few ©

ment, now let’s hear from every-

one else.

side five experienced members. As
their forerunners had done, these
veteran council members serve as
examples for the newcomers.
Freshmen quickly learn how the
council is meant to operate: what
kind of questions are appropriate
and what kinds are not, and which
mindsets should be maintained and
which.are best avoided. Ina simi-
lar vein, lessons learned from past
cases, which can be crucial to a

‘councilmember’s decision, can be

carried by a member to provide
new insight into future cases.
Random jury selection would
eliminate any contribution knowl-
edge and experience from prior
cases could provide. Each case
coming before the council would
be decided by a group of students
with little, if any, experience with
procedure and precedent. The
proper role of a councilperson in
the proceedings, proper lines of
question -- in fact, virtually every
aspect of the hearing -- would be
new to each juror. Time better
spent in debate and deliberation
would be tied up in explanations of
what is “normally done” and why,
And in the end, solemn decisions
of suspension or eviction would be
made by students who, while
competent in decision-making

_ Skills, may lack sufficient experi-

ence to hand down such important
verdicts, Personally, ifmy guilt or

innocence was on the line, I would

wantas muchexpertise on the other
side of the table as possible.

The new proposal would also
radically redefine the role of the
Honor Council Chairman. Under
the current system, the Chairman’s
vote is one of six on a panel and is

no more or less important than

those of the other five jurors. I fear
that, under the random selection
proposal, the independence of these
remaining five votes would be at
risk. Since the Chairman would
most likely be the only voting
councilmember who had served
on a previous case, the possibility
that a juror would feel pressure to

follow the Chairman’s lead would
increase. This is not to say that
Davidson students are wishy-
washy or incapable of making up
their own minds. However, the
fact remains that people in unfa-
miliar situations often tend to look
to those with experience for guid-
ance. In the context of an Honor
Council trial, this could be ex-
tremely dangerous.

As I said before, I can-under-
stand how this proposal may seem
to be more “democratic” in the
sense «that: it: may: more’ closely
represent the perspectives of a
diverse student body, The system
is already democratic. Each year,
students have the right to elect
three of their peers to represent
them on the council. The people
on the ballot are not goose-step-
ping pawns hand-picked by the
college administration; they are by
contrast, your friends, your hall-
mates, your fraternity brothersand
fellow eating house members.
Moreover, they are people who, by
placing their names on the ballot,
have made a public commitment
of their willingness to invest time,
energy, and talent in the Hunor
System. Students vote for the

“individuals they feel are the most

qualified and worthy for the task.
In short, random jury selection
would deny students the right to
choose those people who will be
willing and able to be the best,
most dedicated council members.
Seen in this light; it seems that the
current system may be more
“democratic” than random selec- —
tion.
The Honor System is
Davidson’s most treasured tradi
tion, and the sense of community
and trust it engenders ‘makes
Davidson unique in higher educa
tion. Not only am I confident that ©
random jury selection would be to ”
the student's detriment, I also fear
that the modification would per-
manently alter the character and
appeal of Davidson College. For
these reasons, I strongly urge the
student body to reject the random

jury selection Proposal, —
