What sculpture is to a block of
marbel, education is to a human
soul. —Addison.

‘Things don't turn up in this
world until some one turns them
up. A pound of pluck is worth
a ton of luck.’’

The student body has decided
to erect a bronze tablet in honor
of those who died in Service.
Now for the donor of an attract-
ive set of gates at the entrance
of the Campus on which this
tablet may be placed.

Davidson is very fortunate in
being able to hold Col. Mueller
for next year. Watch him make
things hum. He is certainly a
man we can not afford to lose.

Talking about Spirit and
‘‘Pep’’ Davidson certainly has
it. See on the back page what
the Greater Davidson Club is do-
ing for her.

We wish to express our appre-
ciation for the pleasure which
Mrs. R. W. Miles, Miss Margaret
Miles, her mother and others have
afforded to the Student Body
and the visiting Alumni by taste-
fully arranging a ‘‘Y’’ rest room
and social center at the Gym.

‘*The lucky man is the one who
grasps his opportunity.’’

SUBSCRIPT ION CAMPAIGN.

The Circulation Department has as
its goal “Every Davidson Alumnus a
Subscriber of the Davidsonian.” Dur-
ing the summer our wide awake Cir-
culation Manager will send you a letter
with an enclosed card. Sign up and re-
turn to him. This will mean that we
can give you onc of the best if not the
best college papers in the State. Back
us while we are backing Alma Mater.

a ee DAVIDSONIAN. May 28, 1919

An open letter to the College Men
of the South from the University Com-

MENT |
we write this, you are either speed-| mission on Southern ‘Race Questions :

ing away towards home or have already
arrived and are enjoying the beginning
of your summer vacation, Commence-
ment, 1919, has passed and there will be
no regret in the heart of those who re-

mained for the exercises, for these past
Those
who let the call of home draw them
away beforehand will be the only ones
to regret.

The absence of students was so con-
spicuous that it brought forth many ex-
pressions of surprise. Especially was
this true on Sunday night at the Y. M.
C. A.

We hope that the old college spirit of
Davidson will take possession of the
hearts of all its undergraduates and that
they will to the last man remain through
the whole commencement — exercises.
When we were asked, “Where are your
{ellow students?” we could not keep the
bloud from rushing to our faces as we
would answer, ‘“They have gone home.”

We have heard some speak of making
this great festivity compulsory as in
other colleges, but this will never solve
the problem satisfactorily. “The way to
solve it is to make commencement so at-
tractive that none will want to leave.

This can be done by giving every one
a part. In the first place, let us give
the Freshmen a part. At the beginning
of the year let them organize a dramatic
club, so then when commencement comes
give them a night in which they may
prove their ability to amuse the public.

The Sophomores and Juniors with
others that have musical ability can or-
ganize a band. Then we will not have
to depend on outsiders for our music.

Let the Seniors have a_well arranged
and interesting program ‘for their class
day exercises,

‘And finally may all the student organ-
izations on the hill have open house dur-
ing this brief period of happiness and
goud feeling,

Of course we should not leave out the
Alumni, for they are the larger part.
Let them have a grand procession on the
day of their class reunions with colors
and banners.

With this spirit of co-operation we
are sure that the old commencement
days will soon return.

FOURTH R. O. T. C. DISTRICT'S
CREED,

“Keepe Your Grit and Plug Along.”
The following little squib by Edgar

A. Guest appeals to the District Inspec-

tor to such an extent that he is passing

it on to the sceveral units in this dis-

trict:

“What Wins.’

“It's the exerlasting climbing that
gets you to the top, and the everlasting
sticking to the task you'd like to drop;
it's the grit and vim and muscle in the
rough and tumble tussle that will bring
you home to victory and the distant goal
you seck; it’s the ever up and working,
never lying down and shirking that
eventually will land you on the moun-
tain's suny peak. [t's the patient perse-
verance to the plan which you. have
made that will bring you through the
dangers and the pitfall§ which are laid;
it's the steady, constant driving to the
goal for which you're striving, not the
speed with which you travel. that will
make your victory sure; it’s the everlast-
ing gaining, w rithout whimpering or com-
plaining at the burdens you are pearing
or the woes you must endure. s the
holding to a purpose, and the never giv-
ing in, it's in cutting down the distance
by the little that you win; it’s the sure
and firm endeavor, not the brilliant
stroke and clever, that shall bring you
home to gladness and to days of joy and
song; it’s the iron will to do it, and the
steady sticking to it, so whate'er your
task, go to it! Keep your grit and plug
along!”

Let us adopt this as our creed, and let
each one of us try to live up to the
standard as set. I don’t know where I
have ever found any writing that suits
my fancy quite so well as this, particu-
larly this part. “It’s the iron will to
do it, and the steady sticking to it, so
whate’er your task, go to it! Keep your
grit and plug along!

A NEW RECONSTRUCTION.

The world-wide reconstruction that
's following in the wake of the war will
necessarily affect the South in a peculiar
way. Nearly 300,000 negroes have
heen called into the military service of
the country; many thousands more have
been drawn from peaceful pursuits into
industries born of the war. The demo-
ailization of the army and the transi-
‘ion of industry from a war to a peace
hasis are creating many problems which
an be solved only by the efforts of both
races. ‘The negro in adapting himself

wise sympathy and generous co-operation! June 17th, when the 25th year of the

of his white neighbors. It is to the in-
terest of these as well as of the negro
himself, that readjustment should  pro-
ceed with the least possible difficulty
ind delay.

‘The negroes’ contribution to the wel-
fare of the nation has never béen more
clearly indicated than by his services
during the great war, When the call
to arms was sounded his country expect-
ed him to do his duty, and he did not
fail. Large numbers of black men on
the fields of France made the supreme
sacrifice for the cause of world democ-
racy. In other war services the negroes
did their full share. Many thousands
were employed in the building of ships,
the manufacture of munitions, the con-
struction of cantonments, and in the
production of the coal, iron, cotton and
food stuffs without which victory would]:
have been impossible. ‘The negroes’ pur-

‘chases of Liberty Bonds and War Sav-

ings Stamps and their contributions to
the Red Cross, the United War Work
Fund, and other similar agencies are in
themselves a splendid record of which
the negroes and their white friends may
be justly proud.

Tt may also be appropriate in this
connection to recall that throughout the
period of hostilities the negro was never
suspected of espionage or of sympathy
with the enemy, and that he has been
wholly indifferent to those movements
festered by radical aliens that aim
at the destruction ,of the American
form of government. This goud rec-
ord of the whole race deserves such
publicity as will offset the common ten-/
dency to judge it by the shortcomings
of some of its members, No people is
spurred to higher things when habit-
ually referred to in disparaging or con-
temptuous terms. Ordinary human be-
ings tend to live up to or down to the
role assigned them by their acighbors.

At this time we would appeal espe-
cially for a large measure of thought-
fulriess and consideration, for the con-
trol of careless habits of speech which
vive. needless offense and for the prac-
tice of just relations, To seck by all
Practical means to cultivate a more tol-
erant spirit, a more generous sympathy,
and a wider degree of co-operation be-
tween the best clements of both races,
to emphasize the best rather than the
worst features of interracial relations,
to secure(greater publicity for those
whose viewk are based on reason rather
than prejidice—these, we believe, are
essential parts of the reconstruction pro-
gramme by which it is hoped to bring
into the world a pew era of peace and
democracy.

Thrift is a double protection for wage
earners. [t not only leads to independ-
ence, but it produces those accumulations
of capital upon which, husbanded and
invested by savings institutions, the in-
dustries of the country. and consequently
the opportunity for labor must depend.
Practice thrift by buying Thrift Stamps
and War Savings Stamps.
