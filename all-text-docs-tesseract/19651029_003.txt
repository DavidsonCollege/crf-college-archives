Josh Jr. Follows Father

By HEYWARD CARTER

Davidsonian Feature Editor

One of the -greatest folk sing-
ers of our time, Josh White.
has the following and the inter-
national acclaim to make any-
one connected with him a share
in'some part of his glory.

Anyone. you think, who would
give up a billing at the top of
the ladder for a chance of his

own success in show business
would have to be a fool. But
you are the fool if you find
yourself believing Josh White
Jr. when he tells you that he‘ll
never be able to follow his fa-
ther in greatness.

Young Josh is already great.
He proved that to all who heard
him in the Union Tuesday night.
We already has the style of his
father captured in his guitar—

Junior Year In Hawaii’

Available To Students

The East-West Center at the
University of Hawaii is offering
a junior year program in Asian
Studies in Honolulu.

Dr. Paul Marrotte, a mem-
ber of the foreign studies com-
mittee, said this program was
“a fabulous opportunity for a
good student interested in either
the Chinese or Japanese. langu-
age and culture.”

Dr. Marrotte encouraged any
sophomore or freshman who has
already decided on a profes-
sional career in Asian affairs
to consider entrince into this

program.

The Bast-West Center pro-
gram attempts to promote edu-
cational and. cultural interchange
between Asia and the United
States. The program was de-
signed especially for small lib-
eral arts colleges that don’t of.
fer Chinese or Japanese

The 30 students who are ac-
cepted into this highly competi-
tive program will receive a com-
plete grant of almost $5,000 to
provide for tuition. food. lodging
and transportation. They will
study either Japanese or Chi-
nese at the University of Ha-
waii during the summer between
their sophomore and junior
years. This summer course will
be the equivalent of two full
years of language study.

During their junior year the
students will continue their study
of a language, together with one
related Asian area course and
one or two electives. The 10 top
students will receive further
grants and will spend their next
summer studying in either
Taipei or Tokyo.

The East-West Center also
provides the opportunity for 100
American students to pursue
graduate studies in Asian langu-
ages and affairs on complete
scholarships. These students will

live with other. students from
24 Asian-Pacific countries in an
international atmosphere at the
University of Hawaii.

Vespers To Feature
Folk Music, Guitars

The emphasis of Sunday's Ves-
pers service will be folk music,
and the sermon will be deliv-
ered by the Rev. Will H. Terry,
college chaplain. |

Organist Wilmer Welsh will)
improvise folk hymns for the!
prelude and.the benediction. The |

call to worship is a Negro spirit- ‘|

ual, “Let Us Break Bread To- .
gether."” The Male Chorus will
present an old Southern religious
anthem entitled

by Chip Vogan and David Fore
on guitars.

Since this will be the fifth Sun-
day no faculty homes will be
open to students visitors Sunday '
evening.

Work Will Begin
On Phones Nov. 15

Additional telephones will be
placed in several dormitories
on campus beginning Nov. 15,
according to Mrs. Peter Nich-
olls, supervisor of dormitories.

Mrs. Nicholls also pointed
out that a public telephone will
be placed in the hallway in the

south wing of the College
Union.

vertently reported that the
work would begin Nov. 5. The |
editors regret this error. ‘

He can make you sway to his
rendition of ‘Down and Out” or
keep you absolutely still. strain-
ing with the solid blues feeling
of his own “Baby, Baby, Baby,
Baby.”

But by his own admission, he
is not trying to follow in his ta-
ther’s footsteps, even though no
one really listens to him when
he says that “They are much
too big for me to fill.”

Besides the soul-blues type of
singing his. father became fa-

-mous fo:, Josh often switches

into a faster, more modern folk
number, or he simply impro-
vises on the guitar when the
mood strikes him

Even though he is only 24,
Josh is scarcely a newcomer to

the stage. He has been play-
ing the guitar since he was
four, and up to 1961 he accom-
panied his father on tour and
on some a!bums.

But Josh insists he has, to
make it on his own, and the
only way to do that is to stop be-
ing the son of Josh White and
start being Josh White Jr., sing-
er and guitarist.

Even with fas talent and con-
tacts it hasn’t been easy. In
the four years since he’s been on
his own Josh has cut four sin-
gles and one album by himself.

‘All have caught on in “isolated

spots’’ but he is still waiting for
the one that will ride him to the
top .”

After appearing at Davidson,
Josh went back to N. C. State
(where he also played Sunday)
for a concert on Thursday. -

Meetze said that | two main
changes have been ‘made: the
replacement of two coal boilers
with gas boilers, along with the
renovation of an existing gas
boiler: and the construction of
a new maintenance and engi-
neering shop as an addition to
the old steam plant. A new
slate roof was also added to
the old steam plant.

The two new boilers each cost
about $30,000. All of the boilers
are provided with a new, cen-
trally-controlled “chemical-feed

tion of $20 from the - Student

which provides a ‘100 per cent

give the groups a chance to state
their purpose and activities on
campus as required by. the Stu-
dent Body Regulations. These
forms are usually distributed in
the spring, but Council decided
to wait until fall since many of
the clubs had not yet elected
their slate of officers.

The overall Student Council
platform was discussed briefly,
and Council asked if anyone
had anything pertinent to report
on in his particular area of
concern. No one volunteered.
Council urged every member to
get down to work on his topic.

ATHLETIC COUNCIL

Paul Marion and Sonny
Graves were elected over eight
other candidates to fill the two
open positions on the Athletic
Council. They will serve as stu-
dent body representatives to the
faculty committee which dis-
cusses the use of athletic funds
and passes on such things as
additional tennis courts, more

Dave ‘Powell, freshman ad-
visor, asked that the Council
approve the election of Bobby
Vagt and Johnny Roe to the two
freshman positions on the Cam-
pus Social Council, ‘These boys
have worked on the Freshman
Social Committee and have
shown their willingness to do
this kind of work,’’ said Powell.
Roe and Vagt were unanimous-
ly approved by the Council.

The horror movies will be

of the Union beginning at 8

ROTC drill period Tuesday aft-
ernoon was replaced by a dem-
onstration conducted by Com-
pany A, Third Special Forces
Group from Fort Bragg. The
12-man detachment used the
woods behind the soccer field
as the site for their presenta-
tion which was separated into
six displays.

This Special Forces ‘‘A’’ de-
tachment, consisting of two com-
missioned officers and 10 non-
commissioned officers, had just
returned from Ethiopia where
they assisted in the training of
that country’s army. Captain
John P, Sweeney was in charge
of the company which arrived
by bus Saturday afternoon and
departed early Wednesday morn-
ing.

The first of the six displays
was an exnibit of Special Forces
equipment. One demonstrator
was dressed in the typical out-
fit of a jungle paratrooper. Also
shown was the apparatus em-
ployed by Special Forces in the

Professor Bealy
Shows Progress

Professor Ernest A. Beaty,
who suffered a severe heart at-
tack in the latter part of Au-
gust, is ‘‘more like his cheerful
self,”" according to Dr. J. Alex-
ander McGeachy.

After returning to his home
two weeks ago, Professor Beaty
has been constantly improving
and is now able to move about.
However, on his doctor's advice,
he. may see only a limited num.
ber of visitors at the present
time.

Professor Beaty hopes to pick
up a few classes next semester,
although no definite plans have
been made.

have an auxiliary oil fuel sys-
tem, which they use quite of-
ten since the college buys its
gas on an “‘interruptible gas
rate.”

This rate allows the college
to buy moré cheaply than It or-
dinarily could, but: requires it
to switch off the system when
the demand [or gas is great. “‘If
it gets cold at. all, we usually
have to switch over to the aux-
jliarty system,"” said Meetze. °

The outside of the new main-
tenance shop has been complet.
ed but the inside still needs some
work. The coal bins for the oil

gions.

The demolition display con-
tained not only specially con-
structed equipment, but also
many “homemade” devices. The
“Dirty Trick Department’
made use of a number of de-
molition devices which could be
set off by a person while per-
forming, such routiné tasks as
opening a door.

Two other displays dealt spe-
cifically with the survival of
Special Forces broups. The use
of troops and snares enable Spe-
cial Forces personnel to catch
anything from a field mouse to 9
bear. Food is no problem be-
cause the Special Forces can
prepare and eat everything that
“walks, crawls, swims, flies or
grows from the soil,"" with few
exceptions. Several different
types of traps and snares were
built by the company from ma-
terials found in the area.

The weapons exhibition dealt
explicitly with submachine guns

from various countries. On dis- |

;play were submachine guns
\from Germany. Denmark,
France, Sweden, Israel. and the
,U.S.S.R. as well as the U. S.
Army's Thompson. submachine

boilers have been cleaned and
sandblasted and will provide ad-
ditional space for the shop.

The campus utilities section
will use the new shop. The old
shop, located across the’ street
from the laundry will be left
for woodworking.

When asked if “he expected
any trouble from the new sys-
tem, Meetze commented: ‘We
expect the normal break-in diffi-
culties; we're anxious to get
some real cold weather so we
can check them out. But, all in
all, we expect the new system
to be a great improvement over
the former one.”

Rides Now Available p-
To Walking Freshmen

The Freshman Transportation
Committee. operating under the
direction of Freshmen Blake An-
derson and Bobby Vagt, is at-
tempting to solve the transporta-
tion problem for the freshmen.
In the past, a fraternity broth-
er might be able to provide a
ride, but with delayed rush and
the new rush regulations, the
freshman has found himself
walking much more than riding.

This new committee presents
a very workable solution for
this problem. It presently does
not have funds at its disposal.
but it does arrange rides, coor-

dinate bus, train and plane
schedules and help in any other |
way.

The ‘‘office hours” for the,
FTC are from 6:30 to 7:30 p.m. ,
Monday through Friday in the
Union lobby. Conversations in
the ‘office’ may concern char-
tering a bus or the visitor may
be an upperclassman offering a

ride to someone. The commit-|

te members commented that full
advantage is ‘not being taken of

the service offered and empha-|. _

sized the fact that no one has
been turned away.
