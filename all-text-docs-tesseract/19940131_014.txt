Narratives swagger in folk-tinged rock of Counting Crows

By Rachel Newcomb

By the time you read this ar-
ticle, I’ll be in Morocco. How-
ever, I couldn’t leave without tell-
ing you about what I feel is one of
the best new bands of the decade,
Counting Crows. Their 1993 re-
lease, August and Everything Af-
ter is one of the finest albums I’ve
heard by a new group in years. I
was blown away by their perfor-
mance on Saturday Night Live,
and their record has won them the
Rolling Stone critic’s award for
best new band of the year, an honor
richly deserved.

Hailing from California,
Counting Crows writes folk-tinged
rock music that has drawn com-
parisons to the Band and REM.

However, the
band carves out a
niche all of its
own, taking a fresh
approach to
songwriting.

"In the middle of the night, there's
an old man threading his toes through

a bucket of rain."

-"Omaha," by Counting Crows

ning with stark
vocals, a guitar
rhythm, and
slowly adding
drums and bass,
itis impossible to
deny the song’s

None of the songs

are harsh or grating, and all man-
age to convey a strong melody and
a clear mood or meaning. Lead
singer and songwriter Adam Duritz
has carefully crafted songs that are
extremely intimate, stunning in
their poetic imagery and visceral
intensity.

Throughout the album, Adam

Duritz’s narratives are swagger-
ing. “Omaha,” one of my favorite
cuts on the album, is a chilling
hymn to Middle America. Open-

ing with a haunting organ and
mandolin melody, “Omaha” is full
of brilliant lyrics delivering a tale
ofcycles and anonymity set against
the backdrop of farmland. “In the
middle of the night/There’s an old
man threading his toes through a
bucket of rain,” Duritz croons sol-
emnly in a wavering and emo-
tional voice.

“Mr. Jones,” which you may
have already heard on the radio, is
one of the strongest songs. Begin-

overwhelming sense of sadness
despite the jangly, upbeat melody.
“Believe in me/Because I don’t
believe in anything,” Duritz sings
plaintively as he tells the story of a
man and his drinking companion,
both searching for meaning in a
meaningless existence.

Other songs on the album ex-
cel as well. In “Blue Buildings,”
the soft, carefully modulated mu-
sic provides a background to
Duritz’s reflective lyrics. “Anna

Begins” isan ambivalent love song,
while “Rain King” isalively, eclec-
tic tune that makes allusions to
Saul Bellow’s novel Henderson
the Rain King. “Ghost Train” is
extremely quotable as well, with
lines like “Remember everything/
When only memory remains.”
Many ofthe songs describe asense
ofalienation without alienating the
listener, which results in a feeling
of being brought into the music
rather than being pushed away.
The music creates a thoughtful,
contemplative mood rather than a
depressing one. Although I hate to
compare them to another band be-
cause they are so unique, it is pos-

Still Whistlin' Dixie
Whatever

happened to
Coal Miner's
Daughter ?

By Geoff Graham

Something strange occurred
to me while writing the top ten list
for last week’s article. In Country
music, it seems, the times, they are
a changin.’

Number one was (I’m sure

you remember, but there may be a
deprived few out there who missed
it) Radney Foster’s “Easier Said
than Done.” It’s a serious and
realistic attempt to describe the
aftermath of betrayal. Number four
was Doug Supernaw’s “I Don’t
Call Him Daddy.” Here, a father
tries to fit into his young son’s life
after divorce and distance have
done their best to separate the two.
Number five was Sawyer Brown’s
“All these Years,” in which Mark
Miller voices a couple’s helpless-
ness when an affair emerges in
their decades old marriage.

These aren’t the typical songs
we expect to hear on a Country
station. Whatever happened to
“Take this Job and Shove It,” “Ten-
nessee Whiskey,” or Loretta
Lynn’s “Coal Miner’s Daughter?”
Whatever happened to “Elvira?”
True love, the plight of the work-
ing man, and rural roots still have
astrong hold on much of Country’s
subject matter, but new forces gain
ground every year.

A few years ago, Alan Jack-
son released “Here in the Real
World,” and artists seemed to take
him literally.

Clint Black and Garth Brooks,
being two of the big shots in the
industry, currently enjoy the free-
dom to break away from the mold
with songs like “The Thunder
Rolls” and “A Bad Goodbye” (even
“Killin’ Time” has some definite
suicidal over tones) However, the
trend doesn’t simply end with the
superstars. Hal Ketchum’s 1991
release, “Long Day Comin’,” ex-
emplifies the new type of song in

Collie paints the battles after the war

By Josh Larned
Soldier’s Heart, an exhibit by

Charlotte resident Kate Collie is ©

currently on display at the Visual
Arts Center. Through these series
of portraits and recorded dialogue
of a Vietnam veteran (Steve
Piscitelli), the artist attempts to
relate to the viewer a story that is
together shocking, illuminating,
and frighteningly real.

Collie examines a subject that
is all too often overlooked in
today’s society: the plight of veter-
ans who live with the grim actual-
ity of suffering from post-traumatic

stress disorders. It is no doubt that .

the artist’s intentions in develop-
ing this particular study were de-
signed to create a message decry-
ing the dire effects of battle upon
the individual. Collie describes in
her artist’s statement that “In order
to turn the powerful feelings gen-
erated by these facts into a coher-
ent and, I hope, profound anti-war
statement, I chose to do an “ex-
panded portrait” of a particular
Vietnam combat veteran as a se-
ries of paintings accompanied by
documentation in the form of let-
ters, first-hand accounts, and hos-
pital reports.”

Indeed, the artist successfully

achieves her aim as evident in the
paintings themselves. Each por-
trait is a particular episode from
Steve Piscitelli’s actual Vietnam
veteran experience and the results
ofthe war. “Monterey, April 1969,”
like a blurry photograph--an inac-
curate rendition ofreality)--depicts
Piscitelli as an idyllic youth in
proud stance, readily anticipating

"Collie examines a subject
that is all too often over-
looked in today's society:
the plight of veterans
who live with the grim
actuality of suffering from
post-traumatic stress
disorders."

glory and the prospects of serving
his country. This portrait serves as
a stark contrast to its successor
entitled “Da Nang, February 1970.”
Here in shades of blacks, whites,
and grays, Collie paints a wounded
Piscitelli being awarded the Purple
Heart by a superior in a military
hospital. However, it is not the
setting and palette of the picture
which frightens but the actual coun-
tenance of the protagonist himself...

Piscitelli is changed as his scarred
demeanor reveals the intense men-
tal anguish and fear encountered
during his tour of duty.

In subsequent episodes, Col-
lie examines the widening rift in
Piscitelli’s personality brought
about by an inability to eliminate a
“combat mentality.” “Soldier in a
Shooting Gallery” and its accom-
panying documentation powerfully
convey. this fact with harsh irony
as in this instance for Piscitelli, the
carnival became a metaphor for
the existence which had escaped
him asa result of his tour. In “Dark-
ness Descending,” Collie returns
to a palette primarily consisting of
dull grays to express how the dis-
turbed Piscitelli at that point
strongly contemplated suicide as a
means of escaping his burden. Fi-
nally, “Residuals” concludes the
exhibit with harsh realism as it
shows Piscitelli with a handful of
pills--his only escape from a con-
tinual nightmare.

This exhibit is both powerful
and thought-provoking. For those
interestedin the artistand her work,
Collie will conducta lecture, “Viet-
nam: Notes and Echoes,” Tuesday
at 7:30 p.m., in the Multipurpose
Room.

A new look
at tradition

By Jonathan Brooks

Leo Steinberg, a retired Ben
Franklin Professor of the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania, graced
Davidson students with a series of
inspirational lectures on topics
ranging from Michelangelo’sPieta
to Picasso last week. Steinberg,
who learned English as his third
language by reading James Joyce’s
Ulysses, provided Davidson with
what Dr. Larry Ligo regarded as a
“remarkable two days . . . a con-
tinuous feast ofideas.” Within two
days, Steinberg shared five lec-
tures with Davidson students and
attended a luncheon with the stu-
dents going on the art trip to Rome.
Junior Lizzie McRee, an art his-
tory major, felt that Steinberg of-
fered what “people studying art
need to hear. . .an approach to that
is interactive .. . first looking at the
work . .. rather than reading what
Critics have to say.”

During Steinberg’s first lec-
ture, “Why I Am Unfit to Speak on
Contemporary Art,” he expressed
that since the early 1900s, art has
been the subject of much hostility
from those who have raised the cry
that “this isn’t art.” When posed
with this same question, Steinberg
believed that “every new, original
statement in art arouses fierce op-
position” and that, rather than ask-
ing “is thisart?” the observershould
ask, “what problem is the artist
attempting to solve?” Often in
contemporary art, one might hear
the criticism that “I could do that”
or “my own child could do that,”
but Steinberg challenges the ob-
Server to “just do it, then.”
Steinberg promises that the ob-
server will have “revelations” by
putting his criticism to the test. He
recalled challenging a colleague to
do just that when criticizing a work
of contemporary art. When his
friend’s attempt was compared
with the original, the friend was
able to distinguish that the artist
had accomplished what he himself
