Programs like the day care center, the
Gethsemane step-tutor program, and
the community center hot lunch pro-
gram are less than a mile from campus
but light years away from student con-
cems.

Skillern would like to see twenty-five
students working for the day care center
and fifty students helping tutor elemen-
tary school students.

He believes that “learning how to
work, without being condescending,
comes with involvement” and that such
involvement benefits both students and
citizens.

The third target group is the Davidson
student body. If one eating house wants
to do a service project, the Y will tell
that house the community’s need. Thus,
it will be easier for groups to accomplish

service goals. Groups would maintain
their autonomy and help members of the
town.

SGA proposes

credit hour system

By RICK AVERY

The SGA is presenting a proposal,
concerning the adoption of a credit-
hours system to accompany the planned
switchover to the semester system in the
near future, according to SGA President
Tim Johnston.

Johnston has been working closely
with Burt Taylor of the Educational Pol-
icies Committee to come up with a plan
for a credit-hours system. Johnston said
he has been looking at systems at other
schools and has gottem many ideas that
he is molding into a formal proposal,
which will be presented to the EPC at an
“appropriate time.” Johnston could not
give details about the proposal because
it is not yet finished.

In an interview with the Davidsonian
in late October of 1982, Johnston stated
that he would“. . . go to bat for science

Tim Johnston is at bat for science

majors.” He said that “lab courses
would not be ona fair parallel” with oth-

er schools if Davidson switches to se-

mesters.

Johnston reaffired this week that as-
signing credit-hour value to lab classes
is still a major topic of debate and that
the Credit-Hour Study Committee 1s
working to come up with an proposal
acceptable to the EPC.

Computer down

The failure of a “motor and two
power supplies” on Davidson’s Prime
750 caused the computer to be “re-
moved from.service for two days until
replacement parts arrived” on 14 Janu-
ary 1983, according to Computer Servi-
ces Director Robert DeSieno.

The Center does not expect the com-
puter to malfunction again soon but it
“is just a machine and no machine runs
forever,” DeSieno said.

The festivities will also mclude a pi-

CLARIFICATION

Last week, The Davidsonian in-
correctly reported that 85 percent of
the Faculty believes the next College
president “should come from a busi-
ness rather than academic _back-
ground.” Actually, the vote was for
whether a candidate from a non-aca-
demic background would be accept-
able and not necessarily preferred.
Also, only about half the faculty was
present for the vote.

board formed

from editors and business managers

By PAULETTE KURANI ’86

The Publications Board, consisting of
all the editors and business managers of
Davidson student publications and Col-
lege Business Manager Bob Currie met
last week.

According to Publication Board Chair-
man and Quips and Cranks Editor Jim
Reese, the Board was organized to “in-
sure the high quality of publications on
campus.”

The Publications Board's responsibil-
ities involve the screening of candidates
for editorship of all positions and over-
seeing the finances and budgets of the
student media. It will also set up train-
ing programs to help qualify students
for various positions.

The Board has existed a long time at
Davidson College, but was disbanded in
the early 70’s because of lack of inter-
est.

“The last record ot the Publications
Board was in the 1971 Quips and
Cranks,” said Reese. “After that, judg-
ing from the quality and comments in
certain yearbooks, there was a surge of
apathy on campus.”

Reese got the idea of renewing the
Publications Board when he was flip-
ping through a 1962 yearbook.

“I saw a story on it and felt that it was
a good concept. The yearbook especial-
ly has improved Within the! last few
years and I think that the Board will help
its continued development as well as the
smooth progress of all publications on
campus.”

“I’ve been thinking about forming the
Board all year and the time seemed right
for action during the past two weeks be-
cause of the recent elections. The inter-
est in school publications is at its peak
right now.”
