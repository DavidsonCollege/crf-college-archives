There is a first time for everything. And
what could have been a better time than
Wednesday night in Richardson Stadium for
the Davidson womenis soccer team (4-1) to
defeat the Gamecocks of the University of
South Carolina (0-5)?

In their previous fourencounters, the Game-
cocks had defeated the Wildcats simply with
their precision and aggressive offensive at-
tacks. But this time, it appeared the underdog

. had their ad-
vantage in
goal with se-

3 nior goal-

keeper

Winnie

Corrigan.

The senior

co-captain had her most impressive perfor-
mance in goal so far this season. Corrigan
tallied an outstanding 12 saves on the night.

Saves which gave the Davidson offense the

confidence it needed to push forward and
score two big goals in the second half for the
win.

The only ball that got past Corrigan all
night long was off of South Carolina
midfielder Lydia Bienias in the 23" minute.
An aggressive Amy Leitch ‘04 challenged
Bienias for the ball on the ground just a few
yards from goal. Leitch attempted to clear the
ball, but Bienias got the touch she needed to
send it past her and a diving Corrigan into the
back of the net.

After that, it was all Davidson (or maybe all
Maloney). Eight minutes later, Heather
Maloney ‘03 assisted by her twin sis Tara ‘03,
took the ball down the wing to rip a shot past

orca

Heather Maloney scored 3 goals in 2 games last week.

Corrigan leads women’s
soccer over South Carolina

South Carolina keeper Elise Matthews for the
equalizer. The Maloneys have been a power-

‘ful combination since arriving at Davidson

last year. Tara has received numerous acco-
lades including being a first team All-South-
ern Conference player last season as well as
being a member of the 2000 preseason All- 7
Southern Conference team. While her sister
Heather leads the team in points this season
and is currently ranked 13" in Division I for
points per game (3.00) and 10" in Division I
for assists per game (1.00).

Both Heather and Tara enjoy the opportu-
nity to help each other on the field, especially
to score goals. “We just connect really well,”
said Tara. “We’re always aware where the
other one is on the field without having to
look.”

Netting the game winner became only a
matter of finishing after Maloneyis equalizer.
The Wildcats took 10 shots to the Gamecocks
8 in the second half. Two found the back of
the net. Mary Ellen Schaefer scored the game
winner off a free kick by Deneille Erikson.
The 5’9” sophomore and former high school
basketball star used her “ups” to get her head
on the ball over a stretching Gamecock de-
fense. Schaefer admits to always using her
head for the benefit of the team.

“One of my main responsibilities is to get
to the ball in a free kick situation,” said
Schaefer. “Deneille’s perfectly placed ball

_made it easy for me-to get my head on-and

score.”

The final goal on the evening came from a
Tara Maloney free kick which sailed into the
box and out of the South Carolina keeperis
reach in the 75" minute. Catie Williams ‘04
was there to catch the frazzled keeper off-
guard with her swift touch into the back of the

Football struggles for shut-
out victory over Sewanee

By Gassy PENA AND TALESHIA MURPHY
Staff Writers

After a huge win against the University of
Jacksonville last week, the Wildcat football
team came out with another win, 14-0, against
Sewanee (2-1).

The win did not come easily, however, as
the offense
struggled
to put

14 points on
0 the board.
The team’s
focus and
mentality
that was so dominating in the first game did
not seem to be present against the Tigers.

“We had scoring opportunities early and
missed two field goals and that was frustrat-
ing. We did some things to get us better field
position as the game went on and we hung in
there all day,” said head coach Joe Susan after
the game.

Sophomore receiver Mike Tarver added,
“Offensively, it was tough for us to keep our
heads up during the game, but we remained
focused and came out with a hard-fought
victory.”

The first half did not see much offensive
progress. Sophomore quarterback, Paul
Nichols observed, “We just underestimated
them. We really didnit have a good week at
practice and that showed in the way we
played.”

The only touchdown of the half came on
special teams play by senior Ryan Crawford.
Towards the end of the second quarter,
Crawford, named IAA special teams player
of the week for the second straight week,
blocked:a punt by Sewanee’s Rusty Wood
near the end zone and fell on it for the score.

The ‘Cats went to the locker room at half-
time with a 7-0 lead.

“At the half, I asked our defense if they had
a shutout in them,” said Coach Susan. “The

. answer was a resounding ‘Yes!’” And that

they did. The defense was once again solid as
ever, not allowing the Tigers to get a decent
drive or even decent field position with the
exception of their second possession that got
them to the Davidson 27-yard line.
There were three big sacks of which senior

net for the insurance goal.

Despite-the-Gamecocks’ 16-fouls and -1

yellow card for rough play, the Wildcats
continued to play their game and dominate
the field by consistently beating a downtrod-
den South Carolina team to the ball, and the
Wildcats proceeded to hand their nemesis
number six in their losing streak.

THE WEE

Blake McNaughton had one, sharing another
with senior Ryan Hutto. McNaughton also
had 10 tackles. Junior Sam Fraundorf made
the other sack, and sophomore Jim Carney
ceatributed to the effort with nine tackles.

The second touchdown did not come until
the final minutes of the game.

After not gaining much yardage through
the first three quarters, senior Bryan Fish ran |
for 67 yards in the fourth. On the ‘Cats’ |
second possession of the quarter, Fish fought
for 37 yards followed by a 14 yard run to set
the ‘Cats up for a pass. Nichols sealed the
victory by completing a5 yard pass to sopho-
more Mike Chase, who, using his 6’6” stat-
ure, was able to reel in the pass over the
defender.

The overall sentiment of the game was that
the ‘Cats were not as ready to play as they
should have been.

“These guys were tougher than we ex-
pected them to be. But we put enough points
on the board to win
and thatis what
counts,” said
McNaughton.

The win. gives
the ‘Cats their ninth
consecutive,
breaking the school
record set in the
1917-18 season.
