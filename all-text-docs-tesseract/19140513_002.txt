WELCOME, ALUMNI.

In a few days the campus will be full
of alumni, gathering at Commencement
for the Alumni Reunion, which is to be
this year's feature. Thev will come to
make the halls arid dormitories and
walks ting with glad meetings and old-
time shouts. Manv an old familiar spot
will be visited, many a familiar inscrip-
tion on wood-work and cupola will be
seen again with a strange feeling, many
an old) memory of — pranks. friends,
games, girls, parades, good and bad
times will be recalled as the scenes sug-
gest them. To the Alumni, all wel-
come. We hope these few davs will be

to you as a dip into the fabled fountain] N, C

of vouth, and that the vivid recollections
‘of your college days here will cause
Father Time to turn backward in his
flight and make you a college boy again;
full of spirit and enthusiasm for the
great Davidson that was and is, and the
greater that is to be. You have been
out into the world now, vou have kicked
against the pricks, you have observed
and been observed, and you can tell us
what we need most, what Davidson
needs to make it bigger and stronger
and better. ;

Once a Davidson man, always a Dav-
idson man. is trite but true. It will be
proved at Commencement. It is being
proved all over the South. Davidson
is at a crisis now, and now if ever, she
needs the firm, united, loval support of
her alumni.

Davidson ought ta have an- Alumni
Athletic Association.” ’

Davidson needs an Alumni Associa-
tion.

She needs a good Freshman class next
vear, full of literary and athletic talent.
She needs more equipment. But with
the loyal alumni Davidson has, we need
not fear for the coming of these.

RESPONSE.

Despite the gav and merrv festivities
of Commencement, the charming. pres-
ence of sweet, pretty, laughing Southern
lassies, there will be a tug at the heart
of many a man during the coming week,
and as he turns his face backward on
his college davs at Davidson. It is hard
to make a valedictory happy, it is just
as hard to make a gay response. But
to the Seniors who are leaving us this
vear, we wish every good fortune and
the smile of Heaven. You will miss
Davidson; certainly will we miss vou
when we gather again next September.
The Class of 1914 has left an enviable
record, and with their motto: ‘Loval
En-tout,” they will work for Davidson
loyaly after their departure. Twenty
years hence we expect to find the name
of many a member in “Who's Who"
and the annals of success and service in
phe South and America.
