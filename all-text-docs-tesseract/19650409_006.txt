Golden-Lakey Examine
Speaker-Ban In Chapel

By MIKE MAY
Davidsonian Feature Writer
Hary Golden, author, edi-

tor, and liberal, and Leroy
Lakey, commander of the
American Legion in North
Carolina, were supposed to
debate the speaker ban law

' in last Tuesday’s chapel.

Well, what little could be
heard over the noise of the
animals in thie audience was
really no contest.

Golden took the floor first to
speak against the ban. After-
wards a student remarked, ‘‘He
didn't say a whole lot, but he
sure put on a show.” The origin-
al Carolina Israelite certainly
did that, and he managed to

By HUGH ALLEN

Former Honor Court Chairman

Many times the operation
and work of the Honor
Court is not evident to the
student body until someone
is dismissed for an honor
violation. Then rumors be-
gin to spread about the
“mysterious hatchet men
who axed another member
of the student body.” _ ,

The Honor Court is far from
being an ‘‘axe organization’. In-
stead it is the most vital organ-
ization of the student govern:
ment on campus. Realizing this

fact, the Honor Court has un-.

dergone (and will continue) a
self-evaluation.

This study has been concern-
ed with the image of the Honor
Court on campus. its effective.
ness as a judiciary body, its ef-
ficiency in trial procedure. and
its responsibliity to define and
clarify the Honor Code and
Student Body Regulations.

SELF STUDY

Following is a summary of
the self study beginning last
year and including proposals
for next year (°65-'66):

Last year, the court sent ques-
tionnaires to several schools (in-
state and out-of-state) asking
them abdout their honor system.
structure, student support and
its strengths and weaknesses.

We also polled faculty opin‘on
concerning changes made in the
punishment for an honor code
violation. (In general, the fac-
ulty agreed that the present
punishment, dismissal for two
years, was satisfactory and nec-
essary under our honor system.)

The answered questionnaires
were instrumental in helping

last year’s court revise its trial
procedure. The court extended
the rights and duties of the de-
fendant in order to be fairer and
more just. The court also add.
ed a “charge” to be given at
the beginning of the trial.
PAMPHLET

This year the Court. has been
working’ on the publication of
a pamphlet. This pamphlet will
contain an introduction and his-
tory of the Honor System at
Davidson. Kk will also contain
the Honor Code, Student Body
Regulations and the. trial proce-
dure. This pamphlet will be
available to entering freshmen
and the student body next vear.

The Honor Court has_ also
been very concerned with de-
fining and clarifying the Honor
Code and Student Body Regu-
lations and the court's jurisdic-
tion in these areas: The court
members have discussed these
areas and a committee has
been formed to make a more
detailed study, presenting their
results to the court to be con-
firmed.

The committee will also de-
fine the various punishments
given to violators of the code
and regulations. In order to
include student opinion, the com-
mittee will poll the student body
about the various areas under
consideration. The completed re-
sults wll be included in the
pamphlet.

TRIAL PROCEDURE

This year’s court has found
it necessary to revise two parts
of the trial procedure. They
ate as follows:

1. The accused will be given
at least 24 hours, instead of 5
hours, to prepare his defense
after he has been charged with

while he was at it. '

He began by saying of the
ban, “Its passage was clear evi-
dence that a degree of neuras-
thenia still exisits in our coun-
try." Many people “think of
Communism as a little demon

"Pointing out the fact that the

This is a logical conclusion
of the type of thinking that re-
sulted in the speaker ban law.
, “Supporters of this law do not
understand the American philo-

by emphasizing that we should

The court believed
this longer time period would
be much fairer to the accused.

2. The spokesman will be chos-
en by the chairman instead of
the court, before the trial and
will help carry out the investi-
gation of a reported violation.

The court believed that this
change would enable the spokes-
man to have more thorough and
detailed .knowledge of a case
which would in turn help him
to better formulate the question-
ing of the accused.

The court over the years has
received criticism and been the
v:ctim of sometimes detrimental
rumors following the dismissal
of a student for an honor viola-
tion.

This year, the court has
thoroughly discussed the issue
and has decided to make an of-
ficial non-personal statement
concerning the nature of an
honor violation resulting in the
dismissal of a student.

The chairman, recorder, and
Student Body President (non-
voting member) will decide the
content of the statement to be
announced in a closed student
body meeting. The court be-
lieved this action would help
prevent erroneous rumors and
be in keep‘ng with the court's
duty and responsibility to the
student body.

NEW INSIGHT

In order to gain new insights
and concepts of honor and the
honor system, six Honor Court
members attended an Honor
Council Symposium at Wake
Forest, during Feb. 19-20, 1965.
Schools with Honor Systems
from Virginia, North Carolina,

act and by an audience reac-

tion that nobody should have

to survive. Nevertheless. he did
very littl to help his own
cause.

He stated his position firmly
at the outset. ‘‘We feel that
it {fs a good and just law and
that it should not be tampered
with in any way." Mentioning
the riots at Berkeley, Lakey
noted “increased. participation
in agitation for academic free-
dom."' This he felt was instigat-
ed in many cases by Communist
sympathizers outside the univer-
sities.

Lakey emphasized the ex-
treme dinger of allowing unsus-
pecting college students to. come

r

into contact with the Comnron-
ist menace. “Who would deny
that young: minds are impres-
sionable? Who would willingly
sadject his children to the teach-
ings of a known Communist?"
Whe indeed?

Tire Legionnaire also tried to
refute the charge that the law
was passed too quickly. ‘Who
here would say that this meas-
ure was passed to quickly?"’ A
number of hands were gleefully
raised in response.

Lakey ended by quoting an
atheistic poem by a Communist.
It was clear when he left the
podium that through his own ef-
forts and the unstinting Iabor of
the audience he was retiring

NEW PROPOSALS

This year's court has made
several proposals for the new
court to consider. They are as
follows:

Old labs are not to be copied
in part or in whole whatso-
ever unless so stated by the
professor. Free discussion will
be permitted during lab, but
each person will be responsible
for recording his own results.
Each professor will make a
written statement concerning
pledged work in his labs.

The new court will visit and
discuss this proposal with the
science professors.

The new court will submit a
statement to each professor con-
cerning academic work during
exams. This statement will
