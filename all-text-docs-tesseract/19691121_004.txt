Blood
Intake
Declines

Davidson College's semi
annual blood drive for the
Red ‘Cross November 10 and
11 yielded disappointing re-
sults. Only 230 pints of blood
were collected, as opposed to
about 300 pints last year at
this time.

However, Major Robert W.
Garner of the ROTC.Depart-
ment protested, ‘'The blood
drive did not flop: we simply
did not get as much as we
did last year. That is
tainly not enough to call the
drive a failure.’

Upon investigation of the
reasons behind this drop,
Captain Harry H. Blalock,
also of the ROTC. Depart-
ment, remarked, ‘Certainly,
one of the main reasons for
the drop would be the drop
in ROTC
freshmen and sophomores.”

According to Blalock, more
han 80° of all students who
gave blood last week are tak-
ing ROTC.

“Chief among the advan-
tages that the program gives
students is a knowledge of
their professors as men,
rather than mere fact dis-
pensers,"’ claims Hoyt. He
believes-that by understand-
ing ‘that the faculty and ad-
ministration is composed of
individuals, each with a set
of personal convictions, stu-

dents will enrich their years “

at Davidson.

So far this year there have
been twenty-six Open Hous-
es, with attendance varying
from none to-a dozen. This
element of uncertainty is
generally conceded to be the
most part of
the program, for it is discon
