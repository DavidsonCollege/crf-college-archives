(Letters to the editor do not necessarily reflect the views of the editor.)

An Endorsement

As the months, weeks and days
passed by ‘bringing us closer to the
election - year ritual of endorsement,
we have been increasingly tempted to
avoid such an editorial.

We view with disgust the “cam-
paign” of 1964 and its mud-splattered
candidates. ;

Never knowing what their hassle
with semantics would produce, we
have cringed each time Senator Gold-
water and his supporters have begun
to speak.

Repulsive have been Lyndon John-
son and his corny lines. We have
watched, sadly amused, as the prac-
tical politician has practiced political
opportunism with idealistic cliches
about the “Great Society.” We shud-
dered as the master politician avoid-
ed debate—even of specific issues—
thereby tactitly allowing a degener-
ate campaign to sink even lower.

We would prefer to write no edi-
torial..We would prefer to cast no bal-
lot Tuesday. ;

But the fact remains: there will be
an election Tuesday with the Ameri-
can electorate choosing between two
major candidates. The citizen has the
responsibility to choose the best can-
didate available for office. The choice
is limited, but the responsibility re-
mains. We reluctantly accept this res-
ponsibility. ; ;

The bases for choosing a candidate
must be positive. We are tired of
hearing, “ t's gonna be the lesser of
two evils for me.” Such an attitude is
unhealthy. The individual must deter-
mine why he is for his candidate if he
is to vote with a responsible intellect
and a clear conscience.

In Senator Barry Goldwater—both
in the man and his record—we find a
sincere concern for the individual and
the relationship of the individual and
his government. This concern has
been a factor of significance in the
public posture of Goldwater. We find

it in his vote on labor . . . in his state-
ments on agriculture . . . throughout
the expanse of contemporary politics.

In broad terms, the senator’s rec-
ord is that of a man who has shown
the courage of his convictions in vot-
ing, even when his action has made
him part of a very small group.

“He never sought to lead in the
Senate,” writes one observer. “No law
bears his name. In an organization of
men who have elevated compromise
to an art, he has been loath to wheel
and deal, to strike a bargain here to
gain a point there. He never main-
tained a large staff of advisers or a
retinue of press agents.”

A Goldwater victory Tuesday would
mean no great change in the frame-
work of this nation’s governmental
programs. Regardless of the hopes of
changes would be unlikely. However,
any proposed extension of the social
welfare system—or any other facet
of government concern—would. meet
upon the government as the servant
with more intensive scrutiny under
that elusive criterion of ‘individual
freedom.” The Republican nominee
has consistently expressed his de-
votion to this concept: his loyalty will
not wane. .

We. would not fear the foreign
policy of a Goldwater administration;
rather we would rest more comfort-
ably. The security of these United
States and the Free World rests upon
the respect that potential aggressors
hold for our defense system, a system
which the Arizonan has promised to
maintain as second-to-none.

This nation’s Presidency does not
need a cynic who views the United
States government as a political toy;
we need as a leader a man who looks
upon the government as the servent
of the people, a man who is concerned
with the freedoms of each individual
citizen. a man who is dedicated to
protecting that nation in which these
freedoms have flourished.

Mob Security

We have ceased to be amazed by
the infantile conduct of the Davidson
Student Body as it sits in Chambers
Auditorium. The Davidson student
consistently behaves like a first-class
horse's ass in front of visiting lectur-
ers, entertainers, and fellow-students
alike. ;

This editorial was conceived as we
sat through the recent IFC concert
and heard the super-cool David-
son “men” laugh at a fellow-student’s
attempt to provide a real service for
us all. Not only this, but there were
several children who got their kicks
by talking and strumming on the seats
throughout the concert. Aside from
the fact that said little boys showed
that all their taste was in their mouths,
they exhibited a complete lack of com-
mon courtesy, which i nthis case would
have consisted only of keeping their
mouths shut.

Saturday night was not an isolated
case. Charles Mitchell, while obvious-
ly not the most intelligent speaker
who appeared before a chapel au-
dience, was accorded a reception that
even George Wallace doesn’t deserve.

Another minor — but not insigni-
ficant—incident occured during the
Ian and Sylvia concert. What was the
only song of the evening that caused
the Davidson audience to interrupt the
singing with thunderous applause?
Why, of course—the little Irish ditty
in which Ian burst forth with a rous-
ing “son of a bitch!” This kind of
makes us wonder about the basic in-
telligemce of the Davidson student.

And so, we would offer this bit of
advice to all speakers and artists who
plan to appear before this illustrious
community: Start your performance
with a few “damns” and “hells” and
we will love anything you chose to
say.

It was strangely appropriate that
the Rev. Robert Martin, Sunday’s vesp-
ers speaker, chose to talk ahout the
“Voice of the Crowd.” His observa-
tions about mob psychology rang es-
pecially true in the light of Saturday's
showing. We would not pretend to
know what it is about being in a crowd
that suddenly turns us all into ex-
tremely brave and loud-mouthed

critics. Perhaps we feel safe among
other discourteous: fools; or maybe a
sadistic sense. of humor compels us
to ridicule a man when we are sure
he can’t strike back.

At any rate, we find that it is some-
times extremely embarassing to be a
member of the Davidson Student
Body. And we make a plea for some
small amount of sanity and decency in
future assemblies.

Assets Needed?

_ It has been castigated far more than
it has been praised. Not only has it
aroused the ire of trustees, but it has
also evoked venomous comments from
even the most “nameless faces” in the
student body. It apparently is a failure
for—excepting its president—no stu-
dent has ever participated fully in its
program. And yet the YMCA deserves
the support of every single member
of this community.

The Y occupies a unique position at
Davidson: It is true that no student—
excepting - its president—has ever
participated fully in its program. But
equally true is the fact that no other
organization on this campus has reach-
ed each individual member of the stu-
dent body as extensively as the Y or
with the degree of success that has
been the Y’s.

We were sorry to learn this week
that the Y drive for funds for its an-
nual budget has been faring poorly.
The organization’s $4,500 budget
covered a lot of territory last year,
and, if met again this year, will fin-
ance an equally extensive program.

Forums have proven a stimulus
to thought on our campus; the Book-
of-the-Semester program has brought
us outstanding writers for lectures
and conversations; the Community
Service program has been a boon to
the young people of Davidson and has
Strengthened the bond between the
College and the. Town; although limit-
ed, the Tutorial Plan has been a signi-
ficant and realistic attempt to help
solve one of the greatest problems of
our day.

We urge the Davidson community
to take a second look at this organiza-
tion: we are confident that the YMCA
merits the full support of Davidson,
collectively and individually.

Williams Urges Diversity
In Admissions Policies

Dear Editor:

Complete information about
the argument over Davidson's
admissions policy has not reach-
ed me, but it seems that Mike
Bates’ letter on the subject
omits mention of some of the
newer techniques for increasing
the heterogeneity of the student
body and at the same time
maintaining. and perhaps rais-
ing. academic standards. His
argument, therefore, was weak,
er than it had to be.

He will probably agree that
Davidson has problems because
of the relative homogenity of
its student body. These prob-
lems have been discussed on
campus for a long time.

Their causes perhaps are the
characteristics and friends
Davidson inherits from her past:
characteristics and friends nec-
essary for her present financial,
political, and academic exist-
ence but also-requiring change:
her gradually changing reputa-
tion as Southern school which
trains young men for profes-
sional and business careers and
continues their religious educa-
tion (not so much by teaching
theology as by offering a par-
ticularly acceptable set of ethi-
cal standards).

Whether Davidson is what
people remember, or what they
imagine when they accuse, is
another question, but this gener-
al portrait is somewhat accur-
ate. e
To reduce student body homo-
geneity is to reduce the dis-
tance between a college and the
rest of society. When the first
European universities were
founded, their separation from
society guaranteed their intel-
lectual freedom and was pro-
tected by the church and the
monarchies; it became their
chief attraction and for many
years defeated its purpose be-
cause the newly free students
refused to study.

Writers on the history of Ger-
many universities call the stud-
ents the juvenile delinquents of
their time because they sat in
church and ridiculed the ser-
vice, frightened the police. and
terrorized the citizens,
pean students still retain many
of their privileges after 150
years of university reform, but
the large enrollments and the
necessity of living in apartments
scattered throughout the towns
makes escaping society almost
impossible. —

In the United States the ideas
of educators and social philoso-
phers, plus the heterogenity

of the people and their individ-
BC’

Euro: .

ual opinions, produced the edu-
cational theory that the univer-
sty or college must at the same
time be accessible to society
and somewhat above society.
The fundamental contention is
that knowledge is an abstraction
from life and that therefore con-
tinuous contact with life is
necessary to prevent irrele-
vance. The modern humanistic
disciplines, such as psychology
and: sociology, emphasize by
their being in curricula that the
college or university is continu-
ously investigating society and
individuals; and the arts always
have. .

Dissatisfied with the activity
of modern universities and of
modern university professors,
some groups of people have
isolated themselves and have
condemned the institutions and
their members as impotent. Le
Roi Jones and other poets and
artists are in this group. Jones
freguently prints carcastic re-
marks about this subject in his
own magazine and it has be:
come dogma among some that
creative activity must be separ-
ated from professional occupa-
tions.

Such attitudes and activities,
along with the more traditional
ideas demanding the contrary,
should compell college students
to question their relation to so-
ciety and the relation of their
education to society. The college
should seek many types of stud-
ents to prevent its forgetting the
variety and problems of society.

Admission of relatively aver-
age students is unavoidable, and
refusal to admit those who lack
the standard marks of success
is undesirable in any college or
university which does not other-
wise compensate for this divorce
from society. But there is more
than one way to prevent uni-
formity, especially uniformity of
the type Mr. Bates discusses.

Many universities in the Unit-
ed States are attempting to in-
troduce diversity by accepting
artistically or scientifically tal-
ented students who excell in any
particular field at the expense
of general excellence. Such
admissions policies are not new,
and have also been used as ac-
ceptance criteria for some of
the large scholarships, such as
the Merit scholarship.

Conflict which Mr. Bates al-
so seems to relish, is stiffled at
Davidson — or anywhere else—
not so much by an excess of
average students as by an ex-
cess of easy identity, which al-
lows the student to imagine that
most of the other students are

like him. ‘As both Mr. Bates
and the Davidson administra-
tion maintain, contact with
great ideas, such as Christian-
ity, is necessary, but as the ar-
tists point out, contact with a
Coke bottle can be at least
more interesting than might be
imagined.

Therefore Davidson should
recognize diversity’s importance
and the ease of overlooking di-
versity and interest (as a Coke
bottle is often overlooked); she
should understand that a socie-
ty, also an academic society,
is not a simple balance be-
tween the average and the
bright; and she should form
these understandings into an
admissions policy whose aim is
the justification of Davidson's
intellectual existence in an in-
creasingly demanding academ-
ic world.

Dear Editor:

Randolph Babcock’s impas-
sioned reminder Monday morn-

‘ing that deep inside we know

Bang-Bang is 100% true-blue
emphasizes a recent (Sept. 30)
speech to the Senate by Mon-
tana's junior senator, Lee Met-
calf, which calmly, accurately,
and objectively differentiates
voting records of the current
Presidential candidates.

Reprinted in full In the Con-
grssional Record (page 22499
for disbelievers will to trust the
concludes: ‘It appears that this
year’s campaign
by the Goldwater wing
of the Republican Party is call-
ing attention to some strange
knowledge alleged to be stored
in one’s heart, and if one will
just carefully examine deep in-
to his heart he will recognize
that what Goldwater is saying
is really true... Deep in my
heart a careful examination of
Goldwater's record results in.a
Severe case of heartburn.”

Enough said — although it's
perhaps desirable that the Late
Show, that Babcock is forced
to watch the evening of Novem-
ber 3rd, is one of those subver-
sive imports which show our
cultural delinquents, the shift-
less redskins, finally victorious.
That should make the day com-
plete.

Once More
With Feeling

By TIM KIMREY
Davidsonian Assocciate Editor

MY ACADEMIC UNDER-ACHIEVEMENT and some
of my moments of greatest joy both spring from the
same source—namely that I devote too much time
to pondering such unimportant questions as “Would
1 enroll at Davidson College if I had to make the de-
cision all over again?” This particular question was an-
swered very quietly in the affirmative by such a simple
thing as a Tuesday afternoon walk down Main Street.

Having stomached more of Aristotle's ETHICS than
is healthy in one afternoon, I reached the oft-reached
decision to amble to the Post Office for that letter that
I knew was not there. It was 4:30.

Of course, there was no mail. Decided that an
orangeade would taste good .. . turned toward the
M&M... stopped briefly to admire a baby who was
sitting in her stroller at the top of the Post Office steps
... her mother came, dropped a McCall’s magazine in
the child’s lap, and they started north on Main . . . dog
followed them .. . all three were happy.

At Mary’s I decided to splurge and buy an egg salad
sandwich . . . the 83rd since school started . . . Mrs.
Moore was there ... short and pleasant as ever...
talking of Europe . . . Dr. Kimbrough had on. his sun-
glasses .. . indoors . . . The new Playboy was out... .a-
poor issue . . . but 1 knew it would be sold-out by Thurs-
day ... three Negro children bought ice-cream cones...
vanilla.

I needed some Dial soap and a box of ginger-snaps

. . went to Cashions .. . saw Dean Bailey . . . he was

buying soup and oatmeal. . . Will Terry talked to Mrs.

Martin .. . Mrs. Nicholls looked tired and had a tooth-

ache . .. and the man rang the cash register with a smile
and a word for everyone.

Outside . . . three school-girls headed home from. the
Hub . . . teased hair and budding breasts . . . initialled
notebooks . . . a freshman looked and longed . . . no
letter for him either . . . four dirty little boys rolled tires
down the side-walk . . . pink, elastic bubbles on their
lips . . ..an hour ’till dark ... Dr. Clark chatted with a
lady on the curb... he laughed . . . she drove away. .

The trees beside the church were ablaze with color |
... orange and yellow ... . blue sky ... the slate-covered
Steeple . . . a jet trailed white fluff across the sky . ..
townies revved their motors and called to the Negro sit- |
ting on th trashcan ... he smiled... the old man with
the.wagon held the reins loosely,..clip-clop. . . faded
over-alls . . . he looked straight ahead and tired . . . slow-
ly home . . . the horse knew the way.

The wind carried a slight chill now, as I walked .
through the leaves by Phi Hall. I felt like smiling all +
over. For a moment, I loved this place ... and knew I ]/
would come again. I slept ’till supper. }

RECOMMENDED READING is Paul Tillich’s series
of lectures entitled LOVE, POWER, AND JUSTICE. Here,
Tillich presents a clear and understandable discussion
of the concepts upon which all ethics are based. His as-
Sertion of the importance of power in group and inter-
personal relations marks a milestone in the discussion of
ethics. A sample: “Constructive social ethics are im-

ossible as long as power is looked at with distrust and
ove is reduced to its emotional or ethical quality ...
Constructive ethics presuppose that one is aware of the
element of love in the structures of power and of the
element of power without which love becomes chaotic
surrender.”

Those who think the Christian church should steer
clear of politics, because the church is pure and politics
is dirty business, should read this book, as should those
white liberals who think that good race-relations involve
nothing more than loving and doing justice.

I WONDER HOW MANY DAVIDSON STUDENTS
are enrolled in ROTC I & II who will not qualify
hysically for Advanced ROTC or the Army? And yet,
hese men who will be rejected for military service are
required to waste two years in the Basic ROTC program. |
Why? Could it be that the college receives additional
cash for every student enrolled? Or maybe someone is
afraid that the ROTC program would collapse unless
it was required. Regardless, it seems mildly stupid to
require ROTC of everyone — especially those who will
never be able to serve on active duty.

In case you put me down I put you down

In case you put me down I got it figured
