‘Cat Challenge Brings Two Coaches

By BRUCE BECKER
Staff Writer

The Davidson challenge has
lured two new coaches into the
fooiball program.

Like the Sirens of the
sey.” the challenge has brought
these two young coaches into
the rocky wasters of Davidson's
athletic - academic - economic
problems.

Dave Roberts is 25 years old
and hails from Greenville, S.C.
He bears a slight resemblance
to a short Hoss Cartwright, and
appropriately enough, he will
coach the defensive line.

He graduated from Western
Carolina University and played
some pro ball with the Atlanta
Falcons.

However, he was rendered in
active when he suffered torn
knee cartilege and a separated
shoulder, all on the same play.

Roberts then coached high
school football in South Caro-
lina and last year, college ball
at Eastern Kentucky.

Ron Graham is the one who
doves not look like Hoss Cart-
wright. He grew up in Ohio and
graduated from Ashland Col-
lege.

He spent his next two vears
coaching in high school under
Bob Mosketti, the present Wild-
cat defensive coordinator. Last
season he returned to Ashland
to coach.

Both coaches cite two big rea-
sons for coming to Davidson.

Surprising Matters
Tackle UNC Tonight

The Davidson wrestling team
is undefeated, but coach Charlie
Parker will make no predictions
as to how strong the team is.

“IT still don't know whether
we're that good or they're that
bad,” he said.

Several of the Davidson
Rrapplers are still undefeated in
individual competition.

The team took their fourth
straight in a shutout of Wash-
ington and Lee last weekend, a
win that even surprised Parker.

“Odys-

“IT had heard that they were
a strong team,” he said, ‘‘but
we beat them at every posi-

tion, forfeiting only at 118, as
usual.”’

Davidson has no one to com
pete in the 118 weight class and
is forced to forfeit that position
in every match.

The team should have a
chance to really prove _ its
strength tonight at UNC, accord-
ing to Parker.

“Chapel Hill has a good team,
even though they have only one
wrestler returning from last
year,” Parker stated. ‘They
fave Virginia good fight.”

Next weekend the ’Cats_ will
host a four squad meet of con-
ference teams that will deter-
mine the leader of what Parker
calls the conference ‘‘amateurs”,
the non-scholarship teams.

Davidson, VMI, The Citadel,
and Furman will mect here in a
two-day quad meet.

“The Conference is divided
into two classes."” Parker add
ed, “the scholarship schools and
the non-scholarship schools. The
quad meet here next weekend
will determine the strongest of
the non-scholarship competi
tion,"
