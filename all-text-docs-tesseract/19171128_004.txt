well known former students. He was
born in Alamance County, N. C., on

Graham Academy and Davidson Col-
lege. He served in the Civil War, and
was admitted to the Bar of North Caro-
lina in 1868. He was a member of the
State Legislature in 1874, and from
1880 to 1885 was U. S. District Attor-
ney. From 1897 to 1900 Judge Boyd
was Assistant Attorney-General of the

the Federal bench, which position he now
holds.

White Tule Boyd has reached the
age where he could retire, he is still serv-
ing with great ability. He is one of the
best known citizens of the State, and is
attracting a good deal of attention at
