- Amidst scrapbooks, filing cabinets, weeks-old newspapers
and clippings, and sound by pictures of past Davidson
athletic greats, the members of the Ten O’Clock Club get

‘down to serious discussion, which can be and usually is any
subject which comes to anybody’s mind. If Davidson has
played a game in any sport the day before the conversation
usually turns to that. Other

campus topics are frequently
discussed, but the subject mat-

ter is not limited, and may
range anywhere from the Ko-
rean War to Marilyn Monroe.

_ The Ten O’Clock Club has
no set time limits for its meet-
ings, but since one pot of cof-
fee will only fill so many cups,
the group usually breaks up
sometime before the begin-
ning of third period.

The Ten O’clockers don’t
claim to be an exclusive or-
ganization, but the size of the
Club is limited to the number

which is not many.

The Ten O’Clock Club does

Col. Davis and Capt. Martin. I would say that the Ten O'Clock
Club has a very promising future in spite of the new com-

On the contrary, the Ten O’clockers, chartered only this
_year, have already lured the History Department’s Dr. Frontis
Johnston down from his own third floor Chambers coffee
house for at least one visit. If this trend continues, pre-
eminence on the campus is not far off for the Ten O’clock Club.

Catfish Swim
Citadel's Team
Here Tomorrow

Davidson’s Swimming team will
‘meet The Citadel here tomorrow
afternoon. at two o’clock. Accord-
ing to team captain Jim Bryan the
local tankmen are optimistic as to
the outcome of the meet.

This. attitude can be attributed
to three main reasons. First, the
Catfish are now back to: full
strength since the return of George
| Crone and Budd Montgomery who
| will back up the team in the breast
stroke events. Second, the David-
|son men came closest to victory

| this season against The Citadel in

an earlier meet. Another factor
advan-

|in favor of Davidson is the

| tage of being in the home pool.

| The Catfish won a smashing vie-
| tory yesterday in the Johnston
| Gym pool as they trimmed Clem-
|son by a 55-29 score. Al Ormond
won all three of his events, while
| Bob Patten came in with two first
places.

| Both of the Davidson relay
teams won, their events being the
300- and 400-yard distance swims.

Jim Bryan, Montgomery, and Jim
Golding will handle the 300-yard
relay, while Al Ormond and Paul
Cole will swim. the 220-yard free
style. The 50-yard free style will
, be held down by Bob Patten and
Charlie Haigh. Ormond and Bo Ab-
ernethy will swim the individual
medley, and the diving will be
performed by Charlie Hull ani
Jeff Smith.

Golding and Patten will be as-
signed the 100-yard free style,
while Bryan and Abernathy will
participate in the 200-yard back
stroke. The 200-yard breast stroke
entrants will be Crone and Nichol-
|son, and Al Ormond along with
| Paul Cole will swim the 440-yard
| free style. The final event of the
current season will be the 400-yard
relay in which Bryan, Golding, Pat-

‘ten and Haigh will take part

On Feb. 26-27-28 Davidson will
send representatives to the South-
ern Conference meet af the N. C.
