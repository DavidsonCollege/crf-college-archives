Matinee Madness showcases

On the first official day of basketball prac-
tice, junior guard Janna Magette spent as
much time teaching young kids how to dribble
and shoot as she did preparing for the upcom-
ing season.

Magette and the men’s and women’s bas-
ketball teams used last Saturday’s “Matinee
Madness” at Belk Arena to meet and interact
with local residents, especially youth.

Many schools hold midnight scrimmages
with events geared toward entertaining stu-
dents. But the majority of the crowd of about
300 at “Matinee Madness” was young kids,
many of whom attended Davidson basketball
camp last summer.

“We want the community involved,” said
women’s coach John Filar, entering his ninth

outstanding role models, you want to get

them involved. This is a great way to kick.

things off.”

Players from both teams ran dribbling and
shooting drills and signed autographs for
youth. There was also a three-point shooting

contest in which male and female players
were paired up.

Magette shot an astounding 9 for 9 in the
30-second first round, but her partner, sopho-
more guard Jarred Cochran, failed to connect
on any of his shots, eliminating the duo in the
first round.

The men’s team held a slam dunk contest
which was won by forward Jouni Eho. Eho,
a 6-6 freshman forward from Finland, de-
feated defending champion Chris Pearson
and sophomores Jason Dickens and Cochran
in the finals. Dickens attempted the most
creative dunk of the day, leaping over seated
teammate Fern Tonella and barely missing
the dunk.

Parents like Shelia Brumlow of Davidson
said Saturday’s event was a good opportunity

for her kids to interact with college athletes.

“We could never [come] if it was late at
night,” said Brumlow while watching her two
kids, Eric, 9, Avery, 3.

Magette said she saw many familiar faces
on the court at Saturday’s practice.

“A lot of the girls we see here come to our
camps in the summer. I think it’s a good sign
that they come back,” she said.
