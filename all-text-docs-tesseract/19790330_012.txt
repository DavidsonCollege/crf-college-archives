‘If Davidson were unionized, what would it mean?

In Boston, on March 21,
Boston University officials and
a faculty union reached agree-
“ment on contract difficulties

that averted a two day warning
strike planned by the union.

The attempt at unionization ~

' These and other cases have
opened questions of legality
concerning faculty unions at
independent universities. Offi-
cials at Boston Univeristy have
petitioned the Supreme Court
over a recent decision by a
Massachusetts lower court that
ruled representation by a union
at a private institution illegal.

That case, involving Yeshiva
College, is also pending in the
SupremeCourt. .

Boston University Assistant
to the President John Westling
denied that the new Labor

Relations Act (LRA) applied to

independent colleges and _uni-

versities, claiming “‘faculty po-
sitions should be considered as

the first

managerial and thus not eligible
for representation by Unions

under the LRA.”

The contract proposal first
given to the faculty at Boston
was what he termed ‘‘an object
lesson” in the fact of this law. It
contained clauses that called for
the staff to give up any voice in
peer review, department chair-
man. selection and even course
content and textbook selection.

He made it clear, however,
that the administration in no
way intended to go that far.

The problem at Boston cen-
ters on the institution’s depen-
dence on tuition as the main

-source of income, its endow-

ment being less than $1,800
per student. The administration
there is concerned over tuition
hikes, fearing they would bring
lower enrollment. Their argu-
ment to the faculty cited any

gains from salary increases as
being short term if enrollment

‘dropped, since the result would

be pay cuts or, more likely, loss
of a job for a portion of the
staff.

The professors, however, do
have a strong case. In a recent
report Time magazine listed

* them as the profession most

hurt by inflation. Indeed, pro-
fessors here at Davidson have
seen their mean constant dollar
salary drop some 15.2 percent
since 1966. A bus driver in
Charlotte can make as much as
an assistant professor at David-

son.
Davidson, however, does. not
have the same problem as

Boston. Its endowment per
student does not make tui-
tion dependent. Many profes-
sors are concerned over just
how this money is spent. They
also have asked the Trustees for
a 10 percent increase in pay, a
figure that will just match
present inflation rates.

Dr. McKelway, president of
Davidon College's chapter of
the American Association of
University Professors (AAUP)
commented that the faculty at
this time would not be ready for
a measure as drastic as unioni-
zation. He emphasized, how-
ever, that the current situation
can not be allowed to grow
worse.

Classical Music

If you have grown weary of beer parties, discos, and the like, the
Davidson College Music Department offers a refreshing departure
Friday night at 8:15 in Hodson Hall.

Kristina Bryan, concert Master of the Charlotte Symphony, and
Paul Nitsch, piano instructor at Queens College, will perform three
sonatas for violin and piano by Mozart, Ravel, and Brahms.

The program, which is separate from the Chamber Music Series
is free and open to the public.

Bryan studied at the Peabody Conservatory and the New School
of Music. She has performed as first violinist in several music
groups, and participated last summer in master classes with Aaron
Rosand.

Paul Nitsch holds both bachelor’s and master’s music degrees
from the Peabody Conservatory and studied in Vienna on a
Fulbright scholarship.

He has also participated in the Interlachen Mic Camp, and
appeared as guest artist with the Carlotte Symphony.

Bryan commented that although she tried to select the pieces
simply on the basis of what she likes to play, the program turned
out to be well balanced anyway.

The Brahms is “‘one of the grand works done in recitals,” said
Bryan, ‘‘a real audience pleaser.’’

Phoebe and Roslyn

Phoebe and Roslyn, two singers from UNC-Charlotte, will be
performing in the 900 Room this weekend.

They will be accompanied by a pianist and a bass guitarist.

Phoebe and Roslyn are ‘‘very good.”” There will be four shows,
Friday and Saturday nights at 9:30 and 11:00.

No admission charge.
