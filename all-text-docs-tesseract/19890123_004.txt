AIDS activist warns of dangers to sslleze students

By NUSRAT KHAN

Richard Keeling, chairman of
the American College AIDS Task
Force Committee, addressed the
controversial and frightening is-
sue before the Davidson commu-
nity on Tues-
day.

Keeling be-
lieves that
AIDS is being
transmitted
equally
among
heterosexuals
and homo-
sexuals, but
in the past
few years he
has noticed a
different
trend.

“There is
evidence to
suggest that
the transmit-
tance of the
disease has
dropped in
the general
gay commu-
nity,” he said.

“It appears
that unmar-
ried, non-
drug-using
youth are ata
greater risk
than others in
the present
society.” This
population
has been targeted for AIDS edu-
cation in the United States.

Keeling focuses on certain
high-risk groups on college cam-
puses in his work. “At the Univer-
sity of Virginia we have given
special attention to gay students
and first year students. We have
also paid extra attention to sex
and sexuality issues on campus.”

In trying to help the students to
better understand the implica-
tions of this disease and to induce
prevention measures, Keeling
said that self-esteem and power
are key terms.

“Students must realize that
none of their aspirations of the
world can be fulfilled once they
get this disease. Therefore it is

important that they develop
greater self-esteem and the co’
age and power to abstain fro
havior that can shorte
lives,” Keeling said.
Keeling was concerned about

students’ ideas that Davidson is a
small, safe, protective campus
community where they have little
chance of contracting AIDS.

“The size of the school does not
in any way determine the risk of
the disease on campus. Schools
smaller in attendance size than
Davidson have had a number of
cases of the disease.” He believes
that such an argument is a “poor
rationalization for those unwill-
ing to face the facts.”

Keeling said that condom ma-
chines are necessary on campus
because some students are emba-
rassed to buy condoms at stores.

availability of condoms might

ity, Keeling said, “Condoms in no
way support immoral behavior--

_ they do not force students or any-

one else to have sex.”
One student commented that
the availability of condoms might
make it in-
creasingly dif-
ficult for
young ladies to
say ‘no.’
Keel-
* ing replied, “I
would regard
that “as un-
proven specu-
lation. A
strong sense of
judgement is
fundamental
to protection,

not try to use
external ex-
cuses. When
the issue is pre-
vention, men
and women
should be
ready to accept
attitudinal _re-
sponsibility.”

When
asked about
the form of
language thata

tional program
must use So as
to cater to the
parents or to
more conser-
vative student conceptions, Keel-
ing made it clear that the parents
should be informed in advance of
the college’s AIDS program and
policy.

“It should make its intentions
very clear, and at the same time
prove its unwillingness to subdue
its efforts in any way under any
kind of pressure--parental, stu-
dent or from conservative trus-
tees,” Keeling said.

“If a program is not controver-

sial but instead moderate’ and -

mild, it might as well be scratched
off the plans, for such programs
and proposals are useless. The
key is a proactive relationship
between. the college, parents and
the students. No one should be

“Students should realize that

cause he knows he will have an

cannot withhold such information
from a roommate. It is totally

such an attitude is asking for it.”
Safe sex must be practiced at all
times, for one single encounter
could be a “wreck of life and
sexual activity.”

Every student has aspirations
for success and a career, Keeling
said. Each one’ of us lives with
some hope and ambition from
year to year if not from day to day.
We wish to be attractive, sought
after and popular.

But, as Keeling put it, “AIDS
will interfere with all these hopes
and destroy them.” So it is a
choice of either being prepared
now or suffering later.

“Only a person with a self-de-
feating attitude towards life,
whose life doesn’t matter to him,

rus and ask him to inform his
roommate on an ethical basis and
then leave it up to that individual,
then they might be right.”

Keeling stated firmly his belief
that any student who knows hé is
afflicted with the disease has an
ethical and moral responsibility
to inform his roommate(s) and
other individuals associated with
him of his disease. “Failure to do
so may lead to disturbed relation-
ships which could. prove worse
[for the student] at a time like
this,” he said.

Keeling said that AIDS coun-
selling should be available as it
can fulfill “the one-to-one critical
need of any student.on campus.

“Yes, they should be on campus.”

What about AIDS education on campus?
“Education is important. So many of our students
still answer ‘yes’ to the question that mosquitos can
transmit the virus.”

[12.3% of the 389 Davidson students who partici-
pated in a survey last year said, incorrectly, that
mosquito bites transmit the AIDS virus.]
