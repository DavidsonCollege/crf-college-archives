Dr. Woods recalled the in- |
famous outbreak of Asian flu
which struck the Davidson
campus in October, 1957. The
infirmary was filled with

students, and extra beds were
brought for ailing students to
fill the basement of Cham-

bers, the basement of the

Guest House, and part of the
president’s house.

As the epidemic was at its
apogee during the Homecoming
weekend, 1957, all — activities
were called off. Even the foot-

Council Vote Defeats
Honor Court Motion

aieiae a

roposed amendment to the Student Body Con- |
elegating more power to the Honor Court was |

defeated by the Student Council in its Monday night

meeting.

Having been tabled at last
week's session, the motion was
to give the Honor Court the
power to interpret the two ar-
ticles in the constitution deal-
ing specifically with the Honor
System and the Student Body
Regulations.

With this power the Court it-
self would be able to define

such terms as “cheating,”
“gambling,” and “campus
limits.”

Student Body President Dan-
ny Carrell voiced firm support |
for the motion. After several |
minor disagreements between
the Student Council and the
Honor Court, Carrell proposed
the idea in his campaign speech |
last year. |

“It certainly merits further
consideration,” he said after —
this week’s meeting. “| hope
it will be passed.”

In other business the council
heard routine reports of stand-| '
ing committees. Pierce Howard |
