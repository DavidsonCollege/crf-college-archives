Out Of The Ashes,
A Rose?

One idea emerged from the ashes of
the Davidson Theatre Monday night. It
was an idea which came out from behind
the charred stucco walls Tuesday after-
noon and flung itself squarely in our face.

This idea did not originate in David-
son. Heaven knows where it did originate.
But we first became familiar with it at
Chapel Hill, seat of one of our sister col-
leges. . .

The idea, absurd as it may seem, was
this: why doesn’t Davidson, impoverished
as it is, begin a long-range program of
civic improvement which would in the end
result in a town whose entire architecture
matches the design of the institution
‘around which the main business of the
town is built? .

We are familiar with the difficulties
in time and expense that are involved,
but we have been around long enough to
watch the time and expense at Carolina
which through a slow development has
resulted in a model township, and one
which in contrast to its putrid neighbor,

Carrboro, rings with the atmosphere of |

purposeful scholarship in a community
built around the university.

Somehow this dream doesn’t seem so
hair-brained, even in our tight little
island. We cannot but have a vision of a
day to come when stucco flicks are gone
forever, and when square little buildings
are replaced by stores which look as if
they belang in the same community with
the Davidson College Presbyterian

Church
Chapel, A New Day
Dawning?

The recent report of the Chapel Study
Committee, which has been adopted by
the callege faculty, may well mark the
beginning of a truly effective chapel pro-
gram here at Davidson. This policy is
remarkable both from practical and
religious standpoints.

The actual mechanics of the new
‘policy will go a long way toward eliminat-
ing student discontent and mis-under-
standing. The recommendation calls for
an extremely rigid schedule. On Tuesdays,
Thursdays, and Fridays a purely re-
ligious service lasting up to but no longer
than fifteen minutes will be held—in
brief, a short chapel. On each Wednes-
day convocation will be held. This will
last the entire chapel period and may or
may not be preceded by a five-minute
devotional. From the purely psychologi-
cal standpoint, the inflexibility of the pro-
gram should considerably improve the at-
titude toward chapel, for the student will

* know each day exactly what kind of pro-
gram will be presented and how long that
program will last. In this way the vicissi-
tudes of chapel will not result in disap-
pointment and misunderstanding.

However, the heart of the new system
is planning. Prior to this time the prepara-
tion for chapel services has been on a
week to week basis, sometimes on a day
to day basis, with very little prior plan-
ning. The new policy calls for an inde-
pendent standing committee, which will
de appointed by the President of the Col-
lege and his aides. This committee of five
will include two representatives of the
faeulty and administration, two student
representatives, and the General Secre-
‘ tary of the YMCA. The very formation of
such a committee irregardless of the pre-
viously unheard-of inclusion of student
tepresentatives is a great step forward.
‘The responsibility of this committee will

be to plan completely a semester’s chapel
program before the end of the preceding
term. It is believed by many that a stu-
dent is quite willing to attend a service
which he knows to be well planned and
prepared in advance. The courtesy shown
speakers, even though discussing highly
controversial subjects, during the recent
UCM week tends to bear.this out.

Another major-change included in this
new policy is the allocation of funds to
the chapel committee on which to operate.
In this way the committee will be able
to have the nation’s most outstanding
speakers in the fields of politics, art,
music, sports, and other cultural activi-
ties. The spirit of the new policy also in-
cludes such entertainment as magicians,
concerts, and dramatic productions.

The committee recognizes worship as
the chief objective of the chapel period.
However, we helieve that it is only
through careful attention to the minute
details and mechanics of conducting
chapel that this objective may be attained.
We are glad to note in this policy the
first real attempt to take this into con-
sideration.

Conduct in chapel has improved a
great deal in the last few years. This
has especially been true this year with the
abolition of Monday chapel, following Dr.
Cunningham's decision to take ‘de-
termined action late last spring. The
situation has improved so much that a
freshman is baffled when running across
the sub-head “Passing Back” among such
innocuous headings as “Motor Vehicles,”
“Firearms ,and Explosives,” and “Pets”
in his book of student regulations. The
practice of “passing back” was quite
prevalent as little as two years ago. In-
creased attention and courtesy do not
necessarily mean more worship, but these
coupled with a carefully prepared pro-
gram will create the most favorable at-
mosphere for worship. .

‘In closing, we would urge that the
Chapel Committee never lose sight that
the surest way of reaching its objective
of worship is to follow scrupulously the
mechanical and practical schedule that
has been set up. We would also urge that
the program be put into effect before
next fall, possibly after spring holidays,
if it can in any way be arranged.—T.W.W.

Library Progress Noted;
But Still Room For

Improvement

It is gratifying to note that, although
students may not realize it, the
Library of Davidson College is effectively
taking steps to bring that part of the col-
lege up to standard. Major recommenda-
tions made by management engineers in
@ survey a few years ago were that a
Reference Librarian be added to the staff,
Stacks be installed on the second mez-
zanine, book acquisitions be increased,
and two additional reading rooms be
created. All but the last of these sug-
gestions have been implemented to some
degree.

Within the past year, a Reference Li-
brarian has been secured, and book stacks
on the upper floor have increased the
shelving capacity of the library by 25,000
volumes.

Acquisitions during the years 1947-
1952 averaged less than 1500 annually.
The library acquired 2733 volumes during
1954, according to a report given Wednes-
day to the Board of Trustees. The rate
of acquisition has thus been stepped up
considerably, but it will take many years
to reach the optimum of 80,000 volumes
recommended by the survey, for the li-
brary now has only 62,736.

A library with 80,000 volumes would
approach the level of other institutions
of the same enrollment such as Muhlen-
berg, Knox, and Mount Union, but it
would still be very short of the mark set
by Washington and Lee with 145,848, and
Bowdoin with 224,061 volumes.

The lack of books in some fields is
appalling. As an example, the writer, in-
tending to do some research on Robert
Owen, was amazed to find only one
volume listed under that name—and that
book was by a spiritualist, not the Eng-
lish industrialist. Many standard works
and reference books are not to be found.

The need for more reading space is
apparent to everyone who tries to find a
place to study during review periods and
other times of concentrated academic
effort. The survey recommended that at
least 100 new seats be provided for by
converting the seminar rooms on the
second floor and the middle basement
into general reading rooms. This im-
provement would be welcomed by all stu-
dents who want a reasonably quiet place
to study. —M.A.C.

AN ULTIMATUM:

Eliminate The “Hell Week”
Nuisance Or Suffer The Penalty

On May 26 four years ogo an
ordinarily harmless hell week stunt
at the University of Miami, Florida,
resulted in tragedy for a_ local
fraternity and two boys’ families.
A university freshman was crushed
to death by a truck when he fell
asleep on a lonely road; his com-
panion suffered internal injuries.
The two fraternity pledges had
dropped exhausted to the road
after being taken blindfolded
thirty miles from the campus and
told to find their way back.

A year later seven students at
Hlofstra College in New England
received severe burns of the face
and body when smeared with an
apparently innocent concoction
containing mainly ketchup, mus-
tard, egg yolk and water.

With several spring-like days
this week the Davidson man’s
fancy turned to pledges and pad-
dies and the anticipation of hell
week. Although hazing practices
have declined considerably in the
last decade due largely to mature
Wosld War II veterans’ entering
fraternities, road trips, concoctions
and scuffles are not infrequent
during the early spring months
at Davidson. So far there have
been no real tragedies at Davidson
but this does not insure that it
can’t happen here.

For a number of weeks repre-
sentatives from every local chap-
ter have discussed together the
Davidson hell week situation,
under the auspicies of the Inter-
fraternity Council. True, the Da-
vidson problem is relatively small,
but the potential is such that one
mishap could prove ruinous to the
campus fraternity setup.

Yet the apparent attitude of
this commtitee was striking, re-
flecting to' a degree the general
student feeling on the subject.
The committee’s approach em-
braced a negative philosophy, the
obvious goal being to appease the
college powers rather than to pro-
mote the better welfare of David-
son Greek organizations .. . “Hope

we're pleasing them now; we're,
sure giving up enough.” “Might
not even have an effective hell
week on account of this.”

At the present no policy for the
abolition of hell week is being con-
sidered by the college although
the hope is that steps will be taken
to curb the foolish practices harm-
ful to individuals. No doubt should
a serious accident occur, strong
measures by the administration
would follow.

Public opinion, particularly in
some church groups, is definitely
weighted against fraternities. Just
recently the South Carolina
Baptist Brotherhood passed a reso-
lution which’ included this state-
ment: “It seems that Furman Uni-
versity has not in recent years
been enthusiastically supported by
our denomination as a whole and

‘it is our feeling that one of the

principal reasons has been the dis-
favor with which many view social
fraternities in Christian colleges.”

Most fraternities’ national laws
prohibit any type of hell week.
The practices have continued
despite national headquarters’
threats to revoke the chapters’
charters.

REASONS FOR SUPPORT

Hell week backers have three
reasons for their continuing sup-
port:

1) “Hell week is the climax to
our entire pledge program.” <A
program then built around non-
sense. One in which the neophyte
is relleved rather than proud to
be initiated.

2) “Hell week separates the
men from the boys; we find those
who can really take it.” Granted,
that is interesting. But should the
man who suffers with a grin de-
mand more respect than the boy
who washes more cars, digs more
stumps, and raises the fraternity
scholastic average more points?

3) “Hell week hasn't produced
any major casualties at our house
yet.” Like the auto speed. maniac

Gragg Stung By Own Rapier Thrust

Dear Editor:

Congratulations on Gilbert
Gragg’s editorial in last week’s De
vidsenion. The student body of
of this college hes an appreciable
need for arbiters of Mr. Gragg’s
unique insight. I need not say that
his versatility of interests and par-
ticipation in college events con-
contribute to his accomplishment
in such articles. It is difficult to
attend any sort of activity in which
he is not taking an active part. On
Tuesday, Feb. 8, for instance, at
the ROTC parade, I looked around
during the national anthem, and,
as I might have expected, he was
there, seated not far from me, en-
gaging in an animated discussion.
Such little, though important, ef-

forts must help make up Mr.
Gragg’s penetrating appraisal of
the current campus scene.

Of all the choice bits of irony
in Mr. Gragg’s editorial, none was
more impishly witty than his mock-
horror concerning students’ “un-
excusable noises during the na-
tional anthem” at a basketball
game. Surely those of us who tend
to be bombastic, or at least, overly
serious about patriotism must have
felt the sting of that keen rapier
thrust.

I am looking forward eagerly to
Mr. Gragg’s coming commentary
on Maturity.

Very truly yours,
JIM ARMISTEAD.

eral years, and continues to volun-
tarily expose himself to danger.

The more objectionable hell
week practices are usually admin-
istered by only a few members of
the fraternity.

This can be traced in part to an
inadequate schedule of hell week
activities, the vacant hours being
spent in improvised “goat” stunts.
Worthwhile projects require
greater preparation and coordina-
tion and must be planned well in
advance. Fraternity men support-
ing the idea of a worthwhile hell
week should investigate projects
at once and arrange a complete
schedule for the week. Various
organizations, including the Char-
lotte Planning Center and the Da-
vidson Lions Club, are anxious to
use free pledge labor on back-
breaking jobs, and they are will-
ing to furnish materials for the
job.

The true gentlemen of frater-
nity row are urged to plan now
for a constructive hell week, using
their better judgment for the wel-
fare of their chapters and the Da-
vidson fraternity system.

RACKS

IN THE

LOISTER

By LEIGHTON McCUTCHAN

An Ostrich Approach To

Nuclear

Can it be that the strain of
living in a nuclear age can cause
even the cloistered halls of the
Davidson Outlook to be shaken and
cracked? Are we really living in
a time in which security is less
absolute than ever before? Can the
facts of atomic fission break
through to the thinking of the
normal studént?

Probably not. Nothing short of
a nuclear explosion in Cornelius
could wake us up to the fact that
we live in a world in which man
not} only knows how to kill him-
self more efficiently than ever be-
fore, but is beginning to handle
the trigger of a gun aimed at the
heart of civilization itself.

But what the heck. We've heard
all this before. Even if it is as
bad as all that (which is unlikely)
what can we do about it? Worry
doesn't help. Actually we live in
the consequences of decisions
made by Super Government linked
with Science—that sacrosanct com-
bination is in essence beyond our
control,

However, this ostrich approach
has been rejected by some people
who, rather than letting the demo-
cratic process go by default, are
still trying to face facts however
difficult, and attempting solutions
to them.

JUST THE FACTS, MA‘AM

For example, Col. R. S. Leghorn
(see U.S. News and World Report,
Jan. 28, 1955, sees things this way:
1—The Soviets have nuclear suf-
ficiency, Le., more than two hun-
dred atomic bombs which number
is sufficient to destroy the western
world if used on the major cities;
li—The U.S. has nuclear plenty;
IH—Nuclear weapons are relative-
ly cheap in terms of dollars per
death!

IV—There is neither in being
nor in view any satisfactory de-
fense against: a) nuclear air at-
tack—the Soviets aren't range
limited—our defense screen could
be only 30 per cent effective—the
International Ballistic Missile
(prototyped by the V2) is almost
developed and no defense for it is
even approximated; b) submarine
or secret agent attack is highly
effective against our present de-
fense; c) defense by dispersal of
cities is impracticable and con-
tradictory with the basic ideas of
freedom for which we fight.

WHAT OF PRESENT
OSFANSR?

Leghorn says that at present
we are proposing defense from a
confused strategy, mixing the
three following factors: a) think-
ing in terms of pesslble massive nu-

Physics

clear retaliation if attacked by nu-
clear weapons; b) continuing either
a defensive cold war or; c) turn-
ing to a hot war on the level of
World War Il fighting if the ene-
my attacks in this manner.

Some objections to this type of
strategy are raised by seeing these
things. Massive retaliation means
victory for no one, but rather de-
feat for both and even so we have
not committed ourselves to it for
threat purposes. Secondly, the
present defensive cold war com-
plex does not stimulate us to pene-
trate the contested countries of
the world and wage effective war.
fare against the idea of commu-
nism, and probably you can't kill
an idea with weapons. Thirdly, we
can be engaged, since we sit on
the fence, in a war on a non-nu-
clear level and be whipped on that
level by the superior number of
the enemy. Fourthly, by pursuing
the two policies of atomic and
non-atomic strategy, we either lag
behind Soviet production and ex-
pansion on a non-atomic level, or
we try to meet their through regi-
mentation of our society, but this
is precisely what we are fighting
against.

A WAY OUT

Ugly facts. Ugly cracks in our
cloister. Shall we play like they
don’t exist? Is there a way out?
Perhaps there is. Leghorn says
first that we drop the World War
II strategy, dispose of the Mas
sive Retaliation technique and sub-
stitute for them both the idea of
Nuclear Punishment, which in-
cludes the specifying of the par
ticular type of controlled nuclear
warfare we would use to punish
particular types of aggression (lo-
calized fission for local attack,
ete.)

Secondly, we should announce
this programme to the world,
using it as a specific threat rather
than the vague one that hangs on
both sides today. Thirdly, we could
use the time gained by the above-
method for an extensive political
and moral drive for the disarm-
ament in earnest of all nations,
and the revision of the U.N. char.
ter and powers to effectively con-
trol nuclear production and to pro-
vide a common meeting ground
for the East and the West.

Idealistic you say. You're right.
Impracticable? Yes, in many re
spects. But what is the better
way to solve the present dilemna?
Remember, we probably no longer
live in a time which has near.
absolute security as a goal; only
acceptable security can be hoped
for. I wonder what security will
mean ten years from now.

Publication Editors Clarify New
Method Of Presenting Editors

Scripts ’n Pranks

Everyone is familiar, of course,
with the age-old adage, “A good
speaker is not always a good edi-
tor, and vice versa.” It was with
that maxim in mind that the Pub-
lications Board decided to recom-
mend that public speeches in the
campaigns for the editorial posi-
tions be eliminated. As the situa-
tion stands now, it is quite likely
that someday a shrewd politician
might, .through loud demonstra-
tions and hilarious antics on the
stage, get himself elected to an
editorial post which he is incapa.
ble of administrating. This would
be regrettable for the student
body, as well as unjust to more
qualified candidates.

The constitution committee and
the publications board felt that a
more logical system should be set
up whereby the student body could
become familiarized with a candi-
date’s qualifications without being
subjected to a lot of political
ramblings and statements that
were not at all pertinent to the
issue at hand. The result of this
sentiment was the proposed consti-
tutional change which, if passed,
will have the candidates’ pletform
presented to the student body
through the Davidsonien.

Of course all this means that
we'll be deprived of a lot of funny
stories during election time, but

they'll probably appear sooner or
later in one of the publications
anyway. Besides, three days with-
out speeches will 120 more
q@inutes to be spent sacking, study-
ing, or gaging on Union coffee.

The Davidsonian

By HENRY BROCKMANN

One of the main reasons that
the Publications Board took action
to advise the Student Council con-
stitution committee against
speeches on the part of candidates
for editorial offices was that elimi-
nation of the speeches would
hasten the election period. Upper.
classmen who are famillar with our
election system know that one
of its main drawbacks is the week
after week of continuous balloting
involved.

Though the nominees would not
make speeches under the new sys-
tem, the students would have even

the Davideenian. It has been pro-
posed by the present editors that
all candidates for a given publica
tion present their platforms in
the newspaper on Fridey before
the Monday voting. This, in effect,
could give the students of the col-
lege a chance to consider the plat- ©
forms during the two-day interim
before election.

In expediting elections the pro-
posed article would eliminate the

chapel time involved in speeches
for the publications and thereby
enable balloting or speeches for
other offices. The Publications
board is convinced that the pro-
posed article leaves to the student
body the advantage of free elec
tions, but provides students at the
same time with a better compass
of the true feelings of the nomi-
nees.

Ruby's Report

From Earl Ruby’s column in the
Louisville (Ky.) Courier-Journal
comes the following quotation from
an article “What Should a Student
Acquire in Exchange for Four
Precious Years He Trades for a
College Education?”:

“To be at home in all lands
and all ages; to gain a standard
sppreciation of other men’s work
and a criticism of one’s own; to
carry the keys of the world's li-
brary in one’s pocket and feel its
resources behind him in whatever
he undertakes; to make hosts of
friends among men of one’s own
age who are to be the leaders in
all walks of life; to lose one’s self
in generous enthusiasm end co-
operation with others for common
ends; to learn manners from stu-
dents who are gentlemen and form
character under professors who are
Christians”
