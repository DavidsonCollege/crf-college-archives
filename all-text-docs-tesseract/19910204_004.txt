From The First

Atan enthusiastic meeting onWednesday night, March 18, the
Davidson College Student Body voted for the establishment of a
weekly newspaper. Later, an editor and business manager were
elected and a staff appointed. The present issue is the firstfruits
of this action. “The Davidsonian” makes its initial bow.

In the inauguration of such a newspaper, many questions no
doubt arise. “Why acollege weekly? Does it have a real value?
What will it stand for?”

The newspaper is largely what its name implies, composed of
news. It should be in close touch with every phase of College life
and the life of the community about it. Even in a small college,
life become more and more complex, and as the students are
broken up into an increasing number of groups, there is a
tendency not to look beyond the questions and matters in which
one man is directly interested. The college newspaper should
give live information about every group and department of
college activity, keep them acquainted with each other, and thus
promote a feeling mutual interest and encouragement. In addi-
tion, there are the things which vitally concern every student, and
yet which are not well known or misunderstood.

But the boundaries of a college are not the limits of its campus.
in close contact with it every day is acommunity which is certain
to influence and be influenced by the student. The town column
should make every man feel that he has friends in the town, and
their interest in the college should be increased by the weekly
items and topics about it.

The old Davidson spirit which has held sway at Davidson in
tradition and fact for years upon years goes with the graduate that
leaves here. ...

The newspaper . . . can increase the spirit in athletic, literary,
social, and religious life here; it can be a link between college and
community, alumni and alma mater. The Davidsonian asks for

your earnest cooperation.

Letters

Queen's Alum Scolds Newspaper

Dear Sir:

As an almna of Queens
College in the Charlotte
community, I was shocked
and saddened by the article
by Sara Carlson entitled,
“Davidson and Queens
Women Need to Cut Out the
Middle Men” (January 21,
1991).

The statement quoting
Davidson men’s opionion of
Queens women, “Queenies
come to Davidson to get

laid,” was both degrading
and demoralizing. As a for-
mer Alumni Board President
and Registrar of the college,
Ihave worked for years with
Queens students and have
met none who would fit that
gross generalization.

I am disappointed that
the editorial staff of your stu-
dent newspaper would print
this negative propaganda
which could only broaden

the gap between thestudents
of the two colleges. Queens
and Davidson have a rich
heritage of both social and
intellectual cooperation, and
I only hope that the students
and administration will work
to strengthen this relation-
ship.

Sincerely,

Elise McClung Barksdale,
Queens ‘68

Yarbrough Expresses Certain Qualms

Dear Mr. Savona,

On the whole, I think it
is unnecessary to use our
campus newspaper as a
medium for bickering be-
tween ourselves. However,
as you directed your letter of
the January 28th issue of the
Davidsonian specifically at
Miss Carlson, I will do the
same, and direct my letter at
you. I like to give most
people the benefit of the
doubt, Mr. Savona, and I
certainly hope that your in-

tentions were wholly good, -

but I have some qualms with
your letter, which I will re-
late.

Whether or not you in-

tended to, in your very first.

paragraph you diminish the
issue of rape to a staggering
extent. In fact, your are ab-
solutely patronizing! You
seem to think thatrape is not
a problem or issue that in-
volves you, that itis not your
duty to try to solve it. Mr.
Savona, if indeed you are
concerned, you simply can-
notexpect to sit back and let
the problem solve itself. Or
are you waiting for someone
else to do it for you?

As well, I would be inter-
ested to know just what your
definition of “non-violent
sexual crimes” is. Any rape
isa violentcrime, be itphysi-

cally or emotionally. Fur-
thermore, you have grossly
misinterpreted Miss
Carlson’s meaning behind
her statementconcerning “an
Honor Council trial for sex-
ual harassment.”

I seriously doubt that
Miss Carlson considered her
statement a _ personal
weapon. Itis your own para-
noia that makes it so. Nor
does either of us considerall
the men of Davidson “evil,”
to quote yourself. As well, it
is clear that you have little
understanding of crimes ofa
sexual nature.

Of course women are
capable of committing sex-
ual..harassment. It. just
doesn’t happen very often
because women are too fre-
quently on the receiving end.
Among the vast majority, I
doubt if the thought ever
occurs, and this is due to the
continual victimization of
women and the glorification
of men. The fact remains
that there was no meaning
behind Miss Carlson’ s state-
ment. It should be taken as
read: that no one wants to
end up in a Honor Council
trial for sexual harassment
or rape (paraphrase). The
emotional trauma for all
persons involved would be
too much to bear.

Perhaps Miss Carlson’s
argument was not quite ac-
curate, and you have every
right to defend yourself, but
I am offended by the use of
your letter to destroy the
importance of obliterating
the crime of rape from our
society. I may have acase of
raging feminism, but you
have something worse. Icall
it feminist phobia.

Weare not all out to get
you. Mr. Savona, the reason
many women are so heated
and angry about rape is be-
cause even today, the hei-

_ hous crime remains almost

impossible to convict. None
of us wants to go through the
emotional trauma of notonly
a rape, but of that of a trial,
after which we might see
our attacker released -- set
free to continue to assault
women.

No attack is ever de-
served. The victim is never
to blame. Please remember
this, and don’t cheapen the
issue with your petty state-
ments, We all know what a
“terrible crime” rape is. And
if youaresoconcermed, why
don’t you do something
about it?

Sincerely,
Molly Yarbrough, ‘92

Davidson Defends Male Sex

To Feminists of this Cam-
pus:
Savona’ letter was long
overdue. He’sright. There is
no need for a conflict be-
tween two groups of women
to be blamed on men. I am
tired of the rampant femi-
nism on this campus, and
particularily in this paper.

Not every single conflict or

problem in this world can be
blamed on men oppressing
women. This is ridiculous.
But more than anything, its
unjustified an: wafair,
It’s a waste of the paper
its printed on. What would
happen if some guy who
decided to make it his cam-
paign to hate women started
writing the paper? The
women of thiscampus would
be outraged. No one would

stand for such “male chau-
vinism.”

There is a paradox here.
Sara would like you to be-
lieve that we are strong,
capable individuals equal in
intelligence and ability toour
male counterparts. Fine, I
agree. But she feels the need
to blame a conflict between
two groups of women on

men. ”

If we are so intelligent
and capable would’t we A)
be able to rise above fight-
ing over the men who she
Claims “compare” us and B)
be smart enough to realize
that the men are deceiving
both sides without her hav-
ing to point it outto us? I this
were trueand Davidson men
were running around creat-
ing conflict between the

Queenies and Davidson
women; wouldn’t we have
caught on by now? I would
certainly hope that we are
not so stupid and impres-
sionable.

Isee alot of problems in
this growing trend of women
blaming men. I wish we
could save a few trees and
Cut out such unfair and un- -

Necessary articles in the

paper. I also wish women
would stop crying “‘sex dis-
crimination” when they
don’ tachieve what they want
toachieve. This isequally as
wrong as it is for a man to
truly discriminate. Aa
Men do not deserve to
be blamed for all women’s
