spring Break 1990 here at last

BY ELIZABETH HOWE

With less than a week of classes re-
maining, Davidson students are focus-
ing on where they will be and what they
will be doing on March 10--the starting
date of Spring Break. While Spring
Break is a week earlier this year than it
was last year, this vacation time could
not come early enough for most of us
here at Davidson. Faced with multitu-
dinous mid-terms and a plethora of
papers, we are all ready to leave acade-
mia behind us, even if it is just for ten
days.

While some students are going home

to recuperate, others have concocted
elaborate plans involving sand, sunand
other fun get-aways. The common
thread that runs through each of these
vacation agendas (besides the fact that
they do not involve Davidson) is that
they are all expected to be sources of rest
and relaxation. Lots of Davidson stu-
dents have crafted some pretty exciting
schemes for Break.

Senior Mark Barrow is heading
homeward. He is going to Macon, At-
lanta and Savannah, Georgia along
with several friends. He is especially
excited about being in Savannah, which

he describes as “a happenin’ place.
They know how to celebrate holidays
there, especially St. Patrick’s Day.”
Luckily, St. Patrick’s Day is included in
our Spring Break this year. A more tra-
ditional Break is the goal of sophomore
Sarah Faulkner. She and many of her
friends are going to Destin, Florida, to
spend the week on the beach.

The Bahamas is the destination of the
Davidson volleyball team for their
Spring Break. Freshman Janet Delery
explained that the intent of this trip is
“to have fun during the day and to play
against other teams at night.”

Junior George Snead, sophomore
Dean Vanderwarker anda group. of:
their friends have opted to spend their
vacation ina snowy environment. They
are going skiing in Colorado to get a
change of pace from the unpredictable
Davidson climate as well as to “hang
out with a few ski bunnies,” Snead dis-
closed.

Actually, wherever you wind up for ©
Spring Break this year isn’t that crucial.
As long as you relax and rest up for the
final weeks of spring term, you are vir-
tually guaranteed to havean absolutely
terrific time!

Pledging: “The life of a maggot”

By DAVID COARSEY

How many times have you
been casually walking to class,
still somewhatasleep thanks to
the party last night on the
Court, when suddenly you are
awakened by the sight of some
embarrassed-looking fresh-
man walking around in a dia-
per, or wearing boxers on the
outside of his jeans, or display-
ing a billboard on his back, or
carrying a door with the word
MAGGOT painted across it in
large, bold, black letters? In
psychology we might define
this scene as positive punish-
ment, but we all know it as
pledging.

Some people may consider
some of the things that pledges
are ordered to do a bit harsh.
(Would you want to wear a
diaper to class?) But these

strange sights do possess a cer-
tain underlying value. The
whole general process of
pledging is actually a healthy
way of integrating the pledge
into the fraternity.

When asked what the over-
all goals of pledging were, SAE
pledge educator Charles Han-
dler stated: “Pledging consists
of three major goals: to unify
the group of freshman, to teach
them how to make the house
work and to help them to get to
know the brothers.”

In order to accomplish these
goals, pledges are told to ac-
complish certain tasks which
help them to interact with each
other and the brothers, and
which also encourage them to
get involved in the fraternity.
Visitations and road trips are
standard ways of going about

this process. Visiting means
that the pledge must goand see

each of the brothers in his fra- ~

ternity and find out certain
facts about him. Road trips are
weekend excursions by a
group of four or five pledges
who are sent somewhere in the

country and given a task to

carry out.

Sports, cookouts, pledge re-
treats, mandatory attendance
of house meetings and service
projects are also common ways
of instilling the principles of
brotherhood in the pledges.

Mike Peters, the Kappa
Sigma pledge educator, ex-
plained that pledge activities
should “be beneficial to the
brotherhood and/or the.com-
munity.” He mentioned that in
Kappa Sigma, brothers and
pledges get together and do

service projects such as clean
roads. In Sigma Phi Epsilon,
brothers and pledges work a
concession stand at baseball
games where part of the money
goes to the fraternity and the
rest goes to the Leukemia
Foundation.

You may rightfully ask how
carrying a’ door with MAG-
GOT written across it benefits
the brotherhood and/or the
community. Tasks such as this
are usually a somewhat light-
hearted punishment used to
encourage the pledge to be-
come more fully involved with
the pledging process.

Holme Oltroggle, the pledge ©

educator for Sig Ep, said that
the purpose of this is “to instill
respect for the brothers, the
program and the fraternity.”
However, each of the brothers

was sure to mention in some
way that these tasks are also a
“rite of passage,” as. Charles
Handler put it.

The life of a maggot is not an
easy one--the word maggot
gives that away--but it is fun.
Not all of the pledge activities
are “beneficial to the brother-
hood and/or the community,”
but they are not really harmful
either and most of the activities
do inspire unity in some way
among the group.

Oltroggle said, “The pledges
go through things as a group
and come out as a group.” The
word fraternity means brother-
hood, and the purpose to
pledging is to take a group of
pledges and by making them
go through common experi-
ences together, turn them into
brothers.

Children of the Malt®, Part VIII
Beer from three countries with really bad armies

Children of the malt part viii: Beer from
3 countries with really bad armies--and
3 English beers

by JOHN HUTCHINSON

Thanks to this week’s guest drinkers.
Joining me were Dr. Sue Ross, Registrar
and member of the English department,
and Joyce Robinson, resident of Paris
for 11/2 years and Visiting Lecturer of
Art. Brian Kelly 90 hoped tojoin us, but
he wrote a research paper instead. Pri-
orities. ..

This week we blind-sampled beers
from three countries with really bad
armies--five French beers, two Italian
beers, and one Greek beer. In addition,
we tried three English beers omitted in
earlier columns.

Peroni: Nondescript. “Smells like the
900 room the day after. I would expect
it to be on tap somewhere” --Robinson.
“If someone broughtjt over to watch an
ACC game, I wouldn’t be offended” --
Ross.

Spartan: Cloudy beer. Artificial
“Smells like a magic marker” --Hutch-
inson, “Eucalyptus taste. Tastes like it
would be for your throat” -—
Robinson. “A can’t-keep-your-face-
straight kind of beer. (This would be
great if) you would rather drink beer

thansuck onacough drop” --Robinson.

Kronenbourg: Warm, golden color.
Not offensively tingly to the taste, but
the taste diesin your mouth. When told
it was Kronenbourg: “That’s embar-
rassing. This is what! drink all the time

in Paris. It is the Michelob of French
beers” --Robinson. —

La Belle Strasbourgeoisie: Plain,
golden color. Thin, almost sweet beer.
“A beer to take with you for an after-
noon on the Seine. Chug-a-lug that
one” --Ross. “Reminds me of what
you'd have on tap at the French cafe.
Crisp, pleasant taste” --Robinson.

Fischer d’Alsace Bitter: “Smells like
sour milk, but I’ve had worse things in

my mouth” --Robinson. “The bubbles
lie down, sort of like pond scum. I
wouldn’t bring it to my house, but I'll
drink it since its here” --Ross.

Fischer d’Alsace Amber : Sweet beer.
“I wouldn’tbe upsetifI were served this

-= Robinson.

ina bar. Itsa ginand tonic kind of beer”
--Robinson. “I would take this to a
steeplechase. Not too heavy--you
wouldn’t drag around after drinking
this. I could get a six pack of this” --

Moretti: Lemony smell. Very bubbly,
thin, citrusy taste. “Bright tasting” —
“You could serve it in a
champagne glass. Thisisa beer to shag
with. But it isn’t sophisticated enough
for a horse race” --Ross.

Brasseurs de Paris: Sweet, sort of
malty. Tastes like an English ale. “You
would expect to see this in a pub with
dark wood and leather where the men-
sit on one side sipping this and the
women sit on the other side drinking
something else. Itis leaning in the direc-
tion of a dark beer” --Ross.

Watney’s Red Barrel: Bland, metallic
taste. “Has the chicken coop, barnyard
smell. A beer to gather the eggs by. I
will givein an unqualified “F.” I would
never bring it into my house” --Ross. “I
think ifI got this beer, I’d say ‘bring me
a coke.’ Its nasty” --Robinson. (I won-
der if this beer had not begun to spoil. I
do not recall Watney’s being this spec-
tacularly rank.)

Watney’s Cream Porter: Opaque, very
malty. “Almostlike liquor” --Robinson.
“If you were totally out of other beer,
you could watch the late show with
this” --Ross.

Samuel Smith’s Stout: Opaque, very
bitter. But the taste dies--almost like
beer and nothing. “This confirms my
belief (affinity for) light beer” —Ross.
“Whatever this beer is trying to be, it
