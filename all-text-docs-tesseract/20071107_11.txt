The 2007-2008 Season Preview

Will Watts’s Wildcats return
to the postseason this year?

By SAM DIAMANT
Senior Staff Writer

For Davidson women’s basketball, last
season was possibly the most successful in
the program’s history. After a 23-win regular
season, the team was invited to the women’s
NIT Tournament, participating in postseason
play for the first time.

As a result of last year’s success, expec-
tations are high for the team as it

Coach Annette Watts isn’t
focusing on last year. It’s anew 4
season and a very different team ~
for the Wildcats. Last year’s team
lost three starters to graduation. This
year, a number of talented, though
less-experienced, younger players will
see significant floor-time. With the
departure of Tia Washington ’07, the task of
directing the offense belongs to point-guard
Alex Thompson ’10.

Thompson isn’t the only underclassman
featured in Davidson’s gameplan this year.

“Kelsey [Carey] and Ashley [Lax] are two
freshmen that are going to be strong in the

rotation,” Watts said. Of Lax, Watts said,
“She’s tenacious offensive player, always
looking to score. And I’m well pleased with
the way she’s coming along.”

Carey is a versatile forward who can crash .

the boards but also has the ability to shoot
from three-point range.

“Kelsey [Cary] is a tough player who
always finds a way to finish,” Watts
said.

The third member of the incoming
class, Cloe Woodington °11, has been
sidelined for the year with an ACL
injury.

The team appears to have all the
talent it needs to be successful.

Watts and her coaching staff are
working to find the best system to
take full advantage of the team’s
potential.
“We have a very talented,
skilled team,” Watts said. “It’s
just a matter of figuring out
what combinations will
work.”

Two players, Hamilton and forward
Mandy Halbersleben °09, will miss signifi-
cant time at the beginning of the season due
to knee injuries.

to be a much better team.”

Younger players will be given the opportu-
nity to improve through substantial playing
time early in the season. When Hamilton and
Halbersleben return, the team should be
ready to hit its stride in time for post-season
play.

Over the course of her career, Hamilton
has been a consistent offensive threat. She
averaged 15.8 pts and 5.8 rebounds during
her sophomore season.

Much like their coach, the players down-
play pre-season expectations and rankings.

“We know that that ratings are just ratings,
and it doesn’t matter if we are ranked third or
seventh, we are still going to play hard and
shake things up in the Southern Conference,”
co-captain Hemerka said.

Overall, 2007-2008

should be an interesting
year for the Wildcats. While expectations are
high, the team still must address some needs.
Watts noted, “We're still trying to establish
some scoring leaders and some defensive
stoppers.”

Tough non-conference match-ups early in
the season will give younger players the
opportunity to step up. Hemerka, the only
Starting senior, will anchor the young team
through early SoCon and non-conference
play. Hamilton’s return is much anticipated
and should provide a huge lift for the team
down the stretch.

“We have a talented mix of players, and I
think this is going to be a great year,”
Hemerka said.

The team is optimistic because of its tal-
ent. The ’Cats task will be to determine a
system that allows them to use its talent most
effectively.
