‘Lhe question debated in the Phi So-
ciety last Saturday evening was: “‘Re-
solved, “Vhat the Government of Great
Britain is more democratic than that ot
the United States.”

A. 1. Currie and, C. Howell sup:
ported the aftirmative, while, J. Lb.
Fowle and L. L. Wilson upheld the
negative. The debate was a very shert
one, as the rebuttals were omitted on
account of the Lyceum attraction. ‘lhe
judges rendered their decision in favor
of the affirmative. ‘Che extemporancous
debate was entirely omitted.

G. D. Sample gave a very interesting
declamaion on, “Phe Liberty Bell.”

Saturday night’s debate was the snap
piest in the Mimenean Society this year
as there was only a half an hour be
tween the roll call and time for the Ly-
ceum entertainment. William Love and
R. L. Liston, on the affirmative brought
forward the following points: In Great
Britain there is no supreme court, in
which five men can decide the consti-
tutionality of a law; in the House cf
Commons, a man must voice the opin
ions of the people, while in Congress a
representative can vote any way he
thinks best. The negative side. repre-
sented by ]. B. Woods and G. M. Rob
son, won the debate with the following
arguments: ‘That in great Britain there
is not equal representation; that the
House ot Lords is a very undemocratic
institution; and that the electorate of
Great Britain is not as democratic as
that of the Uniited States.

W. B. Sullivan and J. R. Boulware
gave declamations. “Tribute to Henry

Brand, W.
Negative:
Declama-

Grady” and “Unveiling of the Wash-
ington Monument’ were the selections
rendered.

MATTERS OF PRONUNCIA
TION,

How do you pronounce cantonment ?
Some people call it can-tonment. some
ean-ton-ment, and some can-toon-ment.

The first is preferred by the Century]

Dictionary, the second by the Oxford
English Dictionary and the third by the
Standard Dictionary. The last named ,
authority, however, has an advisory com-
mittee of eminent orthoepists, to whom
words of disputed pronunciation are sub-
mitted, and a large majority of these
have voted in favor of can-ton-ment.
Can-toon-ment is said to be the favorite
pronunciation in Idia. An old spelling
of the world is “cantoonment."—Out-|

HEAR GOOD MUSIC.

Music students should lose no oppor-
tunity to hear the best music, both vocal
and instrumental. Heard with under-
standing ears. one good concert is often
worth a dozen lessons. yet manv_ stu-
dents know nothing in music heyond
what they themselves have practiced, or
what their fellow students give at  re-
hearsals or recitals. Trying to gain a
musical education without a wide ac-
quaintance with. the literature of music.
is like attempting to form literary taste
without knowing the world’s great
books.—A. W. Moore. in For Every
Music Lover.
