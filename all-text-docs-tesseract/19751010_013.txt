David Love

esting Time

Green leaves lie >
Without the hint of hover
In the still summer air.

‘Flowers fold petals
Inward and await
Another sun’s arising.

Bodies bask =
In limpid orange afternoons
Soft and brown.

Is this then death,

Or just the resting time
When one has learned to wait.

Anthony S. Abbott
