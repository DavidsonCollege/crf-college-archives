Fashion show to benefit Metrolina AIDS project and others

-By Jennifer Kerns

On November 12, FLAG will
present “Breaking Out”, a fashion
show to benefit the Metrolina AIDS
Project and Time Out Youth (a
homosexual youth support/advo-
cacy group). Some profits will
help establish a scholarship for a
student serving the Bay commu-
nity.

“We’ re planning to put weekly
ads in The Davidsonian, and all the
Charlotte and local papers,” says
Hal Dougherty, FLAG’s co-chair.
As its biggest event of the semes-
ter, the fashion show involves ev-
eryone on campus, from political
science majors to members of

Patterson Court. Dougherty ex-
pects each organization on campus
will provide a model: “We want
this to be campus-wide.”

For maximum attendance, co-
chairs Dougherty and Cat
Grimmell checked in advance for
possible conflicts. “This date was
planned in August to avoid con-
flicts with other functions,” says
Grimmell. “There is nothing else
going on that weekend at the court.”

Connor, Rusk, and several fra-
ternities have already pledged fi-
nancial support. “I know that two
houses are in financial trouble, but
the rest will help out,” Grimmell
says. The SGA has also donated

Myrick to present her
platform for House race

By Chad A. Lloyd

The Davidson chapter of the
College Republicans invites the
Davidson community to a ques-
tion-and-answer session with U.S.
House candidate Sue Myrick this
Wednesday night at 7:30 p.m. in
the 900 Room.

Myrick is running as the Re-
publican candidate against Demo-
crat Rory Blake for North
Carolina’s 9th District seat.

Myrick’s service record in-
cludes two terms as Mayor of Char-
lotte from 1987 to 1991 and aterm
on Charlotte’s City Council from
1983 to 1985. While mayor, she
served as chair of both the’ Drug
Task Force and Public Safety Com-
mittee in the U.S. Conference of .
Mayors. Aside from her political
background, Myrick is President
and CEO of Myrick Advertising.

On the crime issue, Myrick
believes that “one strike” is enough
and feels that we should convert
closed military bases to prisons in

order to avoid overcrowding. -She
is also committed to doubling sen-
tences for crimes against children
and the elderly.

Concerning the economy,
Myrick supports Thomas
Jefferson’s notion that “the gov-
ernment which governs least gov-
erns best.” She supports the elimi-
nation of the capital gains tax and
the removal of tax and regulatory
burdens on small business, the larg-
est sector ofthe economy. -

Myrick also believes the wel-
fare mentality of “something for
nothing” must énd and will work
for a “two years and you’re out”
policy.

As for health care reform, she
supports Medical Savings Ac-
counts (similar to IRAs) while
avoiding what she considers as
socialized medicine through a gov-
ernment takeover of the industry.

Nationwide mid-term con-
gressional elections will be held
November 8th.

teady this year, FLAG members

tory for current students and

The Next Step

The Residence Life Office
anticipated this issue and has started
researching the subject. Accord-
ing to Kurt Holmes, RLO is com-
paring Davidson to other small lib-
eral arts colleges, such as Amherst
and Swarthmore. Those research-
ing the issue are going to weigh the
pros and cons of co-ed housing.

RLO will investigate the poli-

cies of regional schools as well.

To strengthen the investigation,
Holmes plans to find research that
has already been completed. RLO
hopes to have the research done in
two weeks and then will state its
official opinion on the subject.
Dean of Students Tom
Shandley had not received the ac-
tual resolution as of Friday, but he
has been considering the subject.
He plans to “take the resolution
under consideration and look at
the issue” once he receives it.
Shandley will consult RLO
and consider the research that they

are doing. He also plans to utilize
the Committee for Campus’ and
Religious Life to help him with the
decision. The CCRL includes stu-
dents and faculty and should give
the Dean several perspectives on
the situation. Shandley wanted to
emphasize that no one would be
forced to live in a co-ed situation
against his or her will.
