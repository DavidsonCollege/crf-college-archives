| Christians, he cited Peter as the impul-

| sive, the industrious, the blunt, the doer;

| John as the faithful, the lover, governed |

py his emotions. Still another example
was Martha, the practical, the indus-
trious, the doer; Mary, the lover, content
with her faith. A more modern example
was St. Dominick, the industrious, the
doer, the impulsive, the organizer of
Christian forces; St. Francis, the lover,
content with his faith in God.

In conclusion, under the head of busi-
ness, it was announced that a “feed” was
to be held next Saturday night at the
gymnasisum after the show. All condi-
dates for the ministry are urged to at-
tend. There are approximately 120 stu-
dents in college who say they intend to
make the ministry their life work. Out
of that number there are not half that
attend the meetings each Sunday after-.
noon. '
