Rusk Scholars to run for SGA (just kidding)

By ANJALI SHARMA

If you thought Americans had seen
the lastof their colonial mastersin 1776,
think again. The Rusk scholars, George
Osborne, Erica Maran and Andrew
Kaye, have decided to use their time at
Davidson to settle an old score. “It
won’ tbe long before the Union Jack flies
proudly again over the campus,”
George assures us.

With George as SGA President, An-
drew as Vice-President and Erica as the
glamorous First Lady, driving on the
right-hand side of the road and grilling
out hot dogs at the Union are definitely
out. They’re planning radical moves
that will bring Davidson, and indeed
the entire United States, back under the
aegis of the British Crown.

Their forthcoming campaign will be
the culmination of many seconds of
careful thought and covert activities.
Working for them is a large team of
dedicated pollsters, lawyers, “sound-
bite” managers, and speech writers, the
spearhead of an SGA takeover bid.

When I suggested that their $15

budget seemed a little inadequate for
such an ambitious project, all three
appeared evasive, and they finally
admitted that they “hadn’t really
thought about that.”

Skillfully changing the subject, they
produced messages of support from
Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother,
Prince Charles, Prime Minister Marga-
ret Thatcher and Benny Hill. Princess
Diana reluctantly agreed to return to
Erica the dresses she had borrowed for
her wedding and honeymoon.

As a gesture of goodwill, the Rusk
scholars are prepared to grant an am-
nesty to the American people for the
crimes committed during the War of
Independence. Moving on to specifics,
however, George was still not prepared
to give way on the controversial taxa-
tion/representation issue; subjects will
be taxed, he said, but they need to earn
their right to vote. However, as Erica
pointed out, “there are numerous ad- |
vantages to being British; the passports
are nicer, and the stamps are simply
delightful.” Andrew, concerned for the

Patterson Court interest, emphasized
that undercurrent British Law, thelegal
drinking age is only 18. “Get your
laughing gear around that!” he re-
marked ina state of questionable sobri-
ety.

Of course, the Rusk scholars envis-
age other key changes to Davidson life
as well. They all agreed that language
was an obvious starting point: possible
changes they would make would in-
clude altering “color” to become
“colour”, “theater” to become “the-
atre”, and “aluminum” to become
“aluminium” (one of George’s pet
peeves).

Moreover, the use of awesome’ and
‘dude’ will be strictly forbidden. Erica

has promised a ‘JustSay No’ program to
help that large body of Davidson stu-

dents addicted to T-Shirts; self-support
groups like “T-Shirts Anonymous’ will
be established for those finding it hard
to kick the habit. In addition, Andrew
strongly supports a move to ban those
halfleather/half rubber hunting shoes -
“hideous eyesores”, he calls them.

Intimidated by such ins)
inquired about the food situation. In
response, these Rusk scholars boomed
at me, “last of the hamburger scene;
Domino’s outlawed; french fries to be
chips.”

They continued, “Steak and Kidney
pie, bread and dripping, gruel, suet,
and jam rolly-polly.” Also, clocks will
naturally be put forward five hours,
and ‘the telly’ will be restricted to four
stations.

“Because they pose a significant
threat to the establishment of British
rule in Davidson, all ROTC members
will be required to serve a tour of duty
at one of Britain’s cozy Antarctic
weather-monitoring centers,” George
insisted. Dean Terry’s position will be
given much consideration; unfortu-
nately, it is not guaranteed.

They concluded by saying,” If you
have any questions about the future of
Davidson, and the U.S., do not hesitate
tokeep them to yourselves ...and VOTE
FOR US - because it’s the last vote you'll
have!l”. | \

Children of the malt, Part V |
Taking a taste of more German beers

By JOHN HUTCHINSON
This week’s guest drinkers
were. Robin Barnes, Associate

Professor.of History,.a special-;

ist in-Reformation Germany;
Sonja Fecher, an exchange stu-

dent from Wurzburg; and Kris.
Rengel ‘90, JYA’ student who

spent last year in Wurzburg.

We were surprised that Bav- '

arian beer fared so favorably
during the blind-tasting ses-
sions. The export quality of
Northern German beer is ap-
parently inferior to that of
southern German beer, as Bav-
arian brews were rated consis-
tently higher ae my guest
drinkers.

Dortmunder: Strong and bit-
ter. Fairly weak aftertaste.
“Brewed witha punch. I prefer

my German beer a little —

smoother.” --Barnes. “It makes
me want more” -Fecher.. :
Pinker Pils: Sparkles. Very

tame. “You could throw down.

a lot of this” -Rengel. “Drink-

able, but not much to it. You >
forget about it when you're

done” --Barnes. “A girl would
like it’ Fecher. “German sex-
ism rears its ugly head” --Bar-
nes.

Kronenbourg (Strausbourg,

beer): Sweet smell, smooth, nu-
tritious taste, cloudy. “This is
something a German hippie
would brew” Barnes. “One
could drink a great deal of this
and feel healthy” --Fecher.
Bitburger: Highly carbon-
ated, tinny taste. Has no char-

acter. “Smokestack brew. You

know it’s German beer, but it

has no soul” --Barnes. “Smells

like wet metal” --Rengel.
Sailer:

Cloudy, sweet,

smooth. Dry, little aftertaste.
Pleasant, round, tame flavor.

“You can taste both the earth |
-and.the alcohol i in this, but itis.
alittle wimpy ‘for me. It isn’t a

beer hall beer.” —Barnes. “It

-wouldn’t distract you from

dinner” ~Fecher. “This isn’t a

beer, this is milk!” --Rengel.
Monkshof: Good body, very
smooth. A touch of bitterness.

“This is German beer” --Bar-:
"nes. “My dad would drink it” -

-Fecher. “If this were put in a
German masse (liter mug) in
front of me, I’d be really
happy” --Rengel.

Kaiser (Austrian beer):

Pleasant, but not exciting.

Highly sedimented. Tastes like

a home brew. “Beer brewed by
the Greens (a back-to-land po-

litical party). You can chew on .

this beer it’s got so much sedi-
ment in it’ Barnes. “Tastes
like moldy bread” --Rengel.
Moravia: Rich, real charac-
ter, but not truly full-bodied.
Tastes like a major house beer.
“Very standard, very accept-
able German beer” --Barnes.

“This is a ‘liter beer’--you can
drinka whole lotof it” --Fecher.
Pinker Weizen: Hearty beer

with a nice, sharp aftertaste.
“Smells like potatoes. The taste

makes my mouth water” --
Fecher. “Honest people’s beer.
The finest products of the Ger-

man soil” --Barnes.

Berliner Weizen: Don’t try -

this one without fruit or a shot
of schnapps in it. Otherwise,
we really hope it was not in-
tended to taste asspectacularly
vile asitdid. —
Beck’s Dark: Notheavy, full,
or creamy enough for a dark
beer. “Sparkly, tends toward
bitterness” --Fecher. “Tastes
like a good pilsner beer” —
Hutch. “This isn’t much of a
dark beer” --Rengel.
_ Hofbrau Dark: Smells won-
derful, beautiful dark color.
Very. rich. Coffee aftertaste.
“You don’t forget this one. This
is very good dark beer. Fulfills
all expectations” --Fecher.
“Sometimes you find every-
thing you want in a woman.
This is that kind of beer. It’s

good food. It has so much body
and flavor, you couldn’t throw
it back with impunity” --Bar-
nes.

St. Pauli Girl Dark: Bitter.
Tastes like something is miss-
ing. “Pils with food coloring in
it” ~Rengel. “Not very: eee

tional. Not the dark beer you’d _
want to drink, but I wouldn’t’

turn my nose up at it” -Barnes.

Spaten Dark: Rich, creamy
taste. Slightly sweet. “Guiness-
like consistency” --Rengel. “I
could consume enormous
quantities of this. over the
hours. You could sip yourself
intooblivion” --Barnes. “Thisis

above its function as beer” ="

Fecher. “The Mercedes of dark
beers” - --Barnes.

Our Picks

Best Beer: Monkshof, Moravia, —
_ Hofbrau Dark, Spaten Dark.

Worst Beer: Bitburger, Kaiser,
St. Pauli Dark.

Most Unbeerlike: Berliner
Weizen (really, do not try this
without fruit or schnapps)

Most Distressingly Pleasant:

Kronenbourg. This was a good -
“border beer” from Straus-
bourg. Technically French, it
was first brewed in 1664 when
Germany possessed the area.
We were left nearly catatonic
by the idea of a good “pseudo-"
French” beer.

These beers can be pur-
chased. at La’Mart Deli and
Wines on Sharon Amity in
Charlotte. Most are also avail-
able at Belk’s of Southpark.
One of our favorites, Moravia,
can be purchased at Natural
Resources on Main Street.

One southern German cele-
bration closely associated with
beer consumption is Munich’s
Oktoberfest. Oktoberfest be-

- gan in 1811 as a combination

horse race and agricultural fair
celebrating the second mar-

-Yiage of Bavaria’s Crown

Prince Ludwig the Mad,
builder of Neuschwanstein.
Its popularity continues to-

day. Oktoberfest begins in

mid-September and continues
for two weeks, drawing to a
close on the first Sunday in Oc-
tober. Munich’s 14 local brew-
eries (which are the only brew-
eries allowed ‘to serve beer
during the celebration) pro-
duce a special, sweeter beer for
the occasion. Tents large
enough to accommodate 4,000
peopleare erected by thebrew-
eries, and about 10 million li-
ters of beer are consumed dur-

_ ing the two-week period.

. Thiscolumniswritten out of the
concern that in a quest for quanti-
ties of beer people to often overlook
its qualities.”
