THE BRICK BROTHERS
Hi folks! So you thought
flickerball at: Davidson was
important. Well, it is. But after
sitting through Louis Ortma-
yer’s(known as the epitome of
sartorial splendor among upper
echelon circles) sometimes sti-
mulating, sometimes provoca-
tive, sometimes relevant, but
‘usually not, lectures, the B&BB
contingent felt inspired to re-
port on World IMAC.
World IMAC, for those’ of
you who are uninformed, invol-
ves, the ranking of worldly
powers on the basis of past per-
formance, military-athletic pro-
wess, and basic “‘blow your face
off” power. In case of war these
rankings could affect your life,
so pay attention. .
#1—UNITED STATES: An

excellent road team which ac- .

tually prefers not playing at
home. In fact, they haven't
played a home game since the
intrasquad scrimmage of the
1860's. The US is very tough in
the air but did struggle to gain
defeat, with honor against up-
set-minded North Vietnam.
Still, the US must be ranked #1
in any poll. Teddy for tailback
in 1980!(even though his bro-
ther had a losing record.(
#2—RUSSIA: This bunch of
comrades have shown marked
improvement in the last cen-
tury. In both of .the World
All-Star bowls(WASB I & II),
Russia has shown an effective
rubber band defense combined
with authoritarian coaching.
However, the Soviets’ greatest
asset is their ability to ‘‘put it in
the freeze.” A tactic developed
by Coach V.I. Dean Smithovich
lenin in the '20s., Neither Napo-
leon: nor the Germans could
score on them at home.
#3—CHINA: This club has
awesome depth and can build
railroads with the best of them..
These guys, under the leader-
ship of Vince Lom-tung held
closed practice sessions for
nearly 30 and are now
ready for recognition. Still a
penalty for too many men on
the field thwarted them in the
recent Vietnam game.
#4—GERMANY: This club
was victimized by poor coac-
hing in WASBII but have come
back strong’ by dividing their
squad and concentrating on the
platoon system. However, they
still suffer from weak offensive
and defensive coordination.
#5—JAPAN: This team has
rallied from recent defeats to
build a formidable squad. How-
ever, their cramped playing
facilities make them especially
vulnerable to the long bomb. As
you recall they were burned by
this weakness in WASBIi.
Nonetheless, the offense is
sound and scores at will by
flooding one side with transis-
tors and cameras while sprin-
ging a Toyota around the other
Teams. to watch:
ISRAEL & EGYPT: Because
they practice and scrimmage so
frequently these two clubs have
_ become the KA’s of. World
' IMAC. “Watch both closely—
they could be iinvolved in a very
med — in the future.

GREAT BRITAIN: This

. team had a superior air defense

in WASBII but has been fading
because of front office prob-
lems. Also, a female coach could
prove debilitating and quite
possibly peripatetic.

INDIA: With great depth
they're a potential factor, but a
poor training table slows many

of her younger players
DARKHORSE: Zimbabwe.

World IMAC tidbits. .

Cuba carries on despite a
threatened suspension by the
US for being a Russian farm
club. . . Taiwan recently lost its
franchise but has protested to
the commissioner’s office. . .
Uganda’s home field is nearly
ee attributed to can-
nibalism. .

‘knowledge. .

SF cide maintains

its-enthusiasm but has been
ostracized for lack of rules
. Iceland’s tough
but its players have to go both
ways.

Having put IMAC in its
proper perspective, let’s look at
this week’s games. This week
marked the end of the regular
season and divisional cham-
pionships were on the line.

In the best division, Hurtin’ 4
Gertin’ beat the KA’s 32-25. It
was a tight battle all the way,
decided only by a Parker TD
reception with time remaining.
Dave Welchman sparkled on
defense, while Mike ‘‘Franch-
ise‘‘ Shaeffer dealt for the
brothers of Lee.

In another big game the

overrrated E-baggers nipped

the Wild Ones 32-25. J.R.’s
razzle-dazzle was the difference
and Joby only lined up wrong
eight times. Patrick ‘“The Ham-
mer” Jenevein stuck out as he
struck three guys, decapitating
two.

Finally, in the UN ICEF divi-
sion, Born to Run outlasted the
Old Codgers 29-26. Corty Coo-
per led *the victors, but there
may be a team rebellion on the
horizon. If they do stick toge-
ther, they'll get drilled in the
playoffs.

In other top 10 action, Diggs
and Chip want to be mentioned
for the hips. Mike and Jim want
their girl’s team mentioned,
too. We also thought our two
freshmen ranked teams deser-

ad and the Brick Brothers rate the World’ ‘s great IMAC teams

ved some names mentioned. So
Mark, Mike, Phil, John,.Pete,
and Allen, this ephemeral re-
cognition has been granted to
you. Good riddance. Now you
can transfer.

Even though the Lake Campus may not be in the best of shape, many Davidson people like Kevin Taylor make full use of it.

Lake Campus survives despite chronic money problems

By BERT MOBLEY
Sports Editor

It’s essentially as it was in
1963 when it was built,” said
Sterling Martin about David-
son’s Lake Campus.
a frustration for those of us in
charge of it: We can see its
potential but not reach it,”’ he
said, ‘‘because of financial rea-
sons.”’

Athletic Director Thomas

Cartmill concurred: by saying, -

‘‘An appreciable amount of
funds have not been spent on
the facility, but still it’s a vital
part of recreational activity at
Davidson.”

Regardless of the ‘‘patchwork
maintenance” done at the lake,
the physical education depart-
ment is doing what it can to

assure standard upkeep. One of -

the major undertakings before
this term was the renovation of
the sailboat fleet. According to
Martin, the sailboats were new
a couple of years ago, but the
company has since ggne out of
business and replacing parts is
a problem,

Six of Davidson's scorpions
needed new rudder assemblies

“It’s often

but parts were difficult to
obtain, and the athletic depart-
ment had to change brands to
do the necessary repair work.
Now six of Davidson’s seven
boats have been re-ruddered
and are being used for the
sailing classes. Funding for this
work came from and insurance
adjustment, according to Mar-
tin.

“The major problem,” Mar-
tin said; ‘is the fact we have no
good storage space. We need a
large shed-type building to keep
. the boats in when they’re not
“being used, but that is a low
Priority item.

“To build sheds along with
some dock reconstruction would
take about three years at a cost
of $26 to $27 thousand,” Martin
estimated. ~

The Lake Campus has other
problems, too, besides just
keeping equipment from the
ravages of time and nature.
People don’t treat the campus
so well, either. A number of
boats, etc. have been damaged
by careless students, and the
money for repair work is often
not available; therefore, caring

students are denied the oppor-
tunity to use the lake to its full
advantage.

Another obstacle to the Lake
Campus is theft. Over the
summer numerous canoes were

“stolen from the campus. Other
smaller items continually disap-
pear from the site, and the cost
of replacements adds up.

According to the budget re-
leased last week, only $12,298
were spent on the entire physi-
cal education program last year,
which includes the Lake Cam-
pus. This is not enough funding
to ‘protect the investment,’’
according to Martin.

Some organizations, like the

Ski Club, are working with as
much independent funding as
possible to add to the ‘‘invest-
ment.'’ The Ski Club recently
installed a portable course, and
is now capable of hosting ski
events.

_ The Lake Campus is an asset
to the College, but we're not
capitalizing on the area or what
it can offer. We may lose it if we
don’t go ahead and do somethin
about it. But we're working as
hard as we can to add to it and
protect the investment. Student
interest is a vital aspect of thje
Lake Campus, though to assure
the administration the invest-
ment is worthwhile,"’ he saig

minded
