Field
Hockey
takes Deep
South for
fifth straight

year

By Will Cobb

The 1994 field hockey season
was expected to be a rebuilding
year, but yesterday Davidson de-
feated Catawba College 1-Otocap-
ture their Sth straight Deep South
championship.

The end of the season brought
forth a flood of emotion among
players, especially from those who
have devoted so much time to the
sport over the past four years. The
senior class is the second straight
group to leave Davidson having
won all four Deep South Tourna-
ments they have competed in. The
victory reitified the tradition of
excellence the Davidson field
hockey program has firmly estab-
lished over the years. The Wild-
cats took their balance of offense
and defense into the tournament
and dominated their opponents to
finish the season with an impres-
sive 13-6-1 record.

“This was such a team effort.
I can’t look at our team and point
out a true all-star. They stayed on
target and never let up, “says Head
Coach Betsy Pryor.

Senior Andrea Short made the
winning goal on Sunday with 14:25
left in the first half when she scored
offa pass from junior Nicole Ficeto.
Davidson would keep attacking for
the rest of the game while stifling
the Indian offense to hold on for
the victory. Short capped off a
terrific weekend, accounting for
half of the team’s offense during
the tournament with four goals.
“We had a lot to prove to ourselves
this year, and we were successful,”
says Short.

sunny weather. The afternoon

Late Friday afternoon -

Sunday was a more relaxed
day with the men’s and women’s
swim meet at Baker and then final
departures of parents and family.

Students expressed excite-
ment about the weekend. J.R.
Romanowski says, “My parents
really enjoyed meeting my profes-
sors. It was really nice for them to
be able to put faces with the names
they’ve heard so much about.”
Freshmen Aine Baldwin says, “It’s
really cool to see my parents for

the first time this year and to have ~

my sister stay with me.” There
were also some other observations
made by students about the whole
weekend. Says freshman

perficial — the rooms are clean,
certain posters are off the walls,
and the Commons is serving really
good food.”

New directory, new tradition?

By Russ Tarver
& Susan Warren

A dramatic change from the feminist uproar over last
year’s cover, students were suprised and pleased to find a
Davidson student’s artwork on the cover of this year’s tele-
phone directory. The cover features a reproduction of the oil
painting “Lucy,” created by David Kim ‘94.

In the past, the cover has commemorated campus events
such as Davidson’s 150th anniversary in 1987 and last year’s
twenieth anniversary of women at Davidson. During years
‘when the campus is left without a monumental occasion,
