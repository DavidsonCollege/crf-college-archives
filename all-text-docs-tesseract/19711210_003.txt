Senate Denies Brown Funds

The Student Senate voted 10-9
Tuesday night to refuse to ap-
propriate seventeen dollars and
fifty cents to the newly organ-
ized Brown Student Coalition.

Mark Meza, spokesman for
the brown student group, ex-
pressed his ‘‘deepest disappoint-
ment” that the senate had fail-
ed to meet his requests. Meza
said that the money would have
been used for ‘organizational
purposes.”’

The brown student group is
composed of those Davidson
students of Mexican, Spanish-
American and Latin American
backgrounds.

Meza told the senate that the
Brown Student Coalition, like its
predecessor, the Black Student
Coalition, would offer a sense
of pride and unity to its mem-
bers, and would present to the
whole campus a new cultural

Independents End
Naf'l. Affiliation

In a surprise move the in-
dependents voted to go local and
end their national affiliation in
a meeting Tuesday night.

The vote caused a_ certain
amount of controversy as many
independents had not been ad-
vised of the meeting and did
not vote. Senior Todd Hobbie
said, ‘I was not advised of the
meeting and did not vote.”

The decision is expected to
count as a major victory for
the new social system imple-
mented in the last year and a
half under the leadership of
Dean Will Terry.

The economic problem of na-
tional dues was the chief factor
in the decision.

perspective.

Also, Meza pointed out, such
an organization would help in
the recruiting of future brown
students.

Cecli Burney, a senior class
senator, protested that to grant
the brown students money would
“open the floodgates to every
Tom, Dick, and Carlos that
wanted us to appropriate their
pet project.”

Doug Brown, an active mem-
ber of the black student group
and a sophomore senator, pre-
sented three compromising
amendments to Meza’s propos-
al, all of which were defeated.
One of the amendments was
voted on three times after a
confusion developed when soph-
omore class president Bill Ral-
ston attempted to discern the
nature of the action.

In the final voting on the pro-
posal, several votes were again
necessary as junior senator
Ralph Peeples refused to vote
until after SGA vice-president
Bill Alexander.

In other senate action, fresh-
man class president Steve Can-
trebury moved that all mem-
bers of his class be allowed to
wear beanies. “‘Such an_ ex-
pression of class unity would
be beneficial and helpful,” he
asserted.

David Forester, a freshman
dorm senator, seconded Canter-
bury’s proposal with a lengthy
speech that SGA president Dan-
ny Clodfelter finally ruled out
of order.

In the ensuing heated discus-
sion, it became obvious that
the freshman senators had form-
ed a powerful block. Finally,
Burney, a leading opponent of
the bill, relented, saying that

Library Decision

Reversed Again

By ROSCOE BOOKBINDER
Staff Writer

The proposed E. H. Little Li-
brary changed looks and loca-
tion again this week when the
trustee executive committee re-
versed their earlier decisions.

One member of the commit-
tee, who asked that his name
be withheld for political rea-
sons, said that the committee
had reconsidered their latest
decision and had decided to
stick to the original drawings
of the facade.

“We felt, upon reflection,
that we had been railroaded
into the decision to redesign
the facade of the building,” he

said. ‘‘Once the public brow-
beating was over several of the
committeemen decided they
really did like the original
plan.”

The member _ dismissed

charges from critics of the de-
sign, both faculty and students.
In particular he said that Lar-
ry Ligo, instructor of art, was
out of line in criticizing the
aesthetics of the building.

“I may not know art, but I
know what I like,” he said.
“It’s preposterous to say that
the library looks like a Vel-
veeta cheese box with pencils
glued on the front.”

The controversial decision to
tear down the college union to

make way for the new struc-
ture was also rescinded. ‘The
committee decided -that the
union was really too valuable
in this period of the new social
system,” the member - said.
‘‘We’re considering several 1lo-
cations, including Richardson
Field, the site across Concord
Road, and the location behind
the president’s house.

“We expect that this year’s
freshmen will be studying in
the new library by the time
they graduate.”

Architects indicated that they
expected construction to begin
as early as February of 1975.

the senate should ‘“‘let the fools
wear the damn things if they
want. I’ve only got six months
left here.” Burney’s remarks
were echoed by cries of ‘‘right
on” by senior dorm senator
Danny Berry.

In the final significant action
of the night, the senate con-
sidered the controversial ques-

‘tion of the necessity of its re-

chartering by college president
Samuel R. Spencer. Clodfelter
related to the senate the urg-
ency of the matter, and the
senators responded immediate-
ly.

While Ralston questioned the
nature of the issue, Meza arti-
culated his belief that any such
elitist government should not
exist, and the SGA should not
try to be rechartered.

Burney stated that since the
senate did nothing anyway, such
a discussion was irrelevant, as
was the issue.

Back in ’68 sophomore disk
jockey Ed Dobbs is reputed to
have said that they only thing
holding up the station ‘‘is its
receiving a permit from the
FCC.”

Dobbs, who is now busy pro-
ducing The Archie’s latest hit,
“Farm Out” on the Sugar Pops
label, reaffirmed his belief that
the station would be momentar-
ily back on the air.

“It is just a temporary bu-
reaucratic’ tie-up that the FCC
should straightened out any
time now. Those of you who
miss those highly stimulating,
controversial editorials, will not
have to wait much longer, as
WDAV will soon return to the
air, lambasting every one in
sight,” Dobbs said.

Scott Keeter, who has done
all of WDAV’s recent AM broad-
casting, said that he would go
right on producing the under-
ground WDAV sound on his gen-
uine 5 megacycle Mickey Mouse
transmitter, equipped, he noted,
to transmit the latest in quad-
rasonic sound.

A special 5 second memorial
presentation will also be aired,
