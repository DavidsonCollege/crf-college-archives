Dr. Tom Scott, former
Davidson Director of Athletics

Basketball Committee, died on
November 24, 1993 in Charlotte.
He was instru-
mental in
bringing the
Final Four to

March, plus
many other

other city. A graduate from Kan-

1930, he began coaching at
Concordia and Central Missouri

North Carolina in 1947. In five

Former AD dies at age 85

‘record and was hired by Davidson
in 1955 as athletic director and
head basketball coach.

In 1960, Scott relieved his
coaching duties and hired Lefty
Driesell to coach the Wildcats,
and for the next nine years,
Davidson would enjoy “the glory
years,” finishing in the top 20
seven times with seven 20-win
seasons.”

“If it wasn’t for him, I might
still be coaching highschool,” said
Driesell, “I always was indebted
to him for that.”

Serving as the athletic direc-
tor until 1974, Scott was a mem-
ber of the NCAA basketball tour-
nament committee from 1966 to
1975. He chaired the tournament
committee from 1969 until 1975.
In 1977, Scott was inducted into
the Helms Foundation Hall of
Fame for Athletic Directors. North
Carolina coach Dean Smith adds
in summation, “He'was a man of
integrity and certainly will be
missed by all.”

Four new members were in-

ducted into the Davidson College
Athletic Hall of Fame last month.
The four individuals are Charles
G. “Lefty” Driesell, a 1954 gradu-
ate of Duke University, John Por-
ter ’81, Auburn Lambeth ’51, and
the late Maj. Gen. Thomas G.
Corbin ’37.

Driesell firmly established
Davidson as a national basketball
power, recruiting All-Americans
Fred Hetzel and Dick Snyder. He
also led the Wildcats to six 20-
game winning seasons, four fin-
ishes in the top 10, and two trips to
the final 8 in the NCAA tourna-
ment.

Porter is the only athlete in
Davidson history to twice be hon-
ored as a first team Academic All-
American. A pre-med major, he
