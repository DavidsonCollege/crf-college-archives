Spike Lee and His Legacy
Here at Ol' Davidson College

Spain Disagrees With View That Lee Visit Was a Waste

In the wake of Spike Lee’s
visit here on October 21, only one
column addressed his presence on
ourcampus. More surprisingly, in
the issues following his talk, I
could not locate one letter to the
editor in which anything approxi-
mating an opinion on Spike Lee
could be found, despite the fact
that the News section had written
lengthy articles before and after
Lee came. While itis true that two
faculty members wrote letters a
week before Lee arrived, only Scott
Windham and Deidra Montague
published any response on the sub-
ject.

I was convinced that Lee’s
discussion would generate endless
debate in these pages. Perhaps the
impending election stole Lee’s
thunder, but I really don’tknow. If
there’s one thing of which I am
certain, Lee’s presence on our cam-
pus did not go unnoticed... Many of
us waited outside of Chambers for
an hour and a half while the fire
department looked for some kind
of explosive device that never ac-
tually materialized, Thank God.

And we followed Lee to
Johnson Gym, many of us sitting
on the floor for another hour and a
half. For a few days following his

talk, [heard lots of discussion about
Spike Lee, but sadly, no one chose
to publish their opinions, and

Spainhour

quickly, the subject faded into old
news,

Personally, I enjoyed seeing
and hearing Spike Lee. As Diedra
and Scott pointed out, some people
were disappointed that Lee had not
been more controversial and that

, the money (somewhere in the

neighborhood of $15, 000 accord-
ing to unsubstantiated rumor) had
been poorly spent. I disagree with
both sentiments.

Any time a speaker can draw
such a large number of students,
the money has not been wasted. I
think it’s worthasking, would some
people suggest that if Lee had in-
cited a riot, the amount of money
paid him could be more easily jus-
tified?

I think there are twodynamics
at work here. First, Spike Lee’s
visit ecouraged and fostered a good
amount of discussion, but people
were not moved to spend an hour
formulating a written opinion to
submit to this paper. Second, by
the time the paper came out the
following Monday, Spike Lee had
been condemned to some distant
remove by tests and papers and
George Bush and Bill Clinton
and,..whatever.

In the future, I hope people
willrealize that the Opinions pages
are everyone’s forum and that we
need some serious commentary
once in a while, because, quite
frarikly, these pages can foster a
degree of banality that serves no
one, and that’s everyone’s fault.

Frampton Rules...

Scary, I'll Tell You Scary

The wind whispers softly but
sadistically. Heavy footsteps
pound the forest floor. Overhead
the leaves brustle and cast strange
shadows over the panicked, blonde
co-ed as she runs for the safety of
something, anything..

Behind her a man, machete in
hand, keeps follows her walking
with long but determined steps.
The music begins to shriek louder
and louder, “Kill, kill, kill...” She
looks back for her pursuer, push-
ing off the trees as she runs into
them. Suddenly, as if placed there
for a reason, a log lays across her
path. She trips, slamming into the
ground.

She stumbles up again but a
hand grabs her foot and she trips.
She rolls onto her back, trying to
move on, screaming with the hor-
ror of a well-dubbed studio re-
cording. Her shirt is torn, her
knees dirty. His hand raises in the
air, the machete gleaming in the
moonlight, the blood dripping off
of it. It falls fast and -furious,
decapitating her in one swing.

The dream is always the same.

Every Thursday the twelfth I wake >

up in a cold sweat the blondes
death on my mind. Undoubtedly,
it is‘an amalgam (remember the
usher in Parenthood) of all the The
Friday the Thirteenths and Hal-
loweens that I have seen. But it
isn’t what really bothers me about

Friday the 13th.

Whatbothers meis that people -

get scared by stupid things like
superstitions. Now I understand
doing something like turning your

Chris Frampton

socks inside out twice before you
put them on (it keeps you from
getting warts on your feet) or spray-
ing Fantastik onto your new note-
book to remind the Note Fairy to
help you take good notes. But, I
simply don’t understand whatisso
scary about Friday the 13th.

Now if you want to get scared
think about the possibility of run-

ning across Oprah Winfrey naked
ina field of daisies running toward
in great leaps and bounds scream-
ing to you, “Honeycakes,
honeycakes...” That would be
scary. Or how about waking up
with parts of a cow scattered

_ through out your room.

Butthe most frightening thing
I can imagine is being sucked into
a black hole. I mean what’s in
those things? For all we know they
could be a portal to another uni-
verse where toe-cheese is used as a
perfume. Or people wash their
faces with a mix of rotten pumpkin
and fromundacheese. This thought
scares me.

(Has anyone else noticed that
I have been writing really gross
things lately, maybe I should see
someone.)

These things are really scary.
For some reason people don’t rec-
ognize the validity of these fears.
Instead, they cower atthe possibil-
ity of breaking mirrors or walking
under ladders.

Then there is this fear of
Strange numbers like 666 or 3 or
13. Those aren’t scary numbers. 3
trillion dollars is a scary number.
(Well, actually it’s an amount, but
so what?) Oh, and what about pi.
Do you know some idiot took the
time to write down to volumes of a
