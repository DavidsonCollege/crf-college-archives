Former Davidson Student,
Serving Eight Churches,
Talks At Vespers

Dr. R. H. Stone, former stu-
dent at Davidson, delivered a
sermon at the vesper services
Sunday evening, speaking
about people who are not con-
.tent with what God has given
them.

His text was Psalm 106:15,
rhe gave them their requests;
sent leanness into their souls.”

* Flight From Egypt

As an example from — the
Bible, Dr. Stone related the story
of the people of [sraclt when they
were fleecing from Egypt. He
brought out how well God had
Hlaken care of them, giving them
manna_for food, and then how, the
people became so discontented that|
they requested meat instead. God | Society during his senior year-here.
was displeased, but He fulfilled the
request, even though it sent lean:
ness into their souls,
