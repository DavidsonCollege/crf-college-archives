THE DAVIDSONIAN

Lion Cub Menaces Frat Row
As Pet Eludes SAE Pledges

18 Distinguished Churchmén
To Head Charlotte Services

What is this? The King of Beasts reigned supreme for a
brief 24 hours in terror-stricken Fraternity Court this week as
grim-faced hunters stalked him to his lair. The heat was on for

the amateur Frank Bucks of
“Bring him back alive!"’

The novel acquisition of two
hearty men somehow escaped the
doting care of its “owners,” and,
following that ancient tradition, the
pledges were drafted to find the
lion before he caused any trouble.

Nowhere

Armed with 30-caliber flashlights
and dogged “etermination, the party
set out to track down its prey. A
diligent search of every frat house
failed to unearth the creature, how-
ever, and the disgruntled amateurs
returned to their own camp to be-
moan their fate as well as the
lion's.

But all was not lost. A few of the
more experienced members under-
took the dangerous task of explor-
ing the basement in hopes of find-
ing the beast safely back in its
quarters.

In the Basement

Imagine their surprise and as-
tonishment when they beheld the
ferocious anima! crouched in the
farthest corner, immobile and
menacing!

Nevertheless, the
hunters triumphantly

undaunted
seized the

SAE as the word went out,

creature by the talls and mane and
hoisted him bodily to the floor
above, where there was a scene of
much rejoicing.

On the Roof

After considerable. speculation as
to what should be done with the
lion, it was finally agreed that the
safest place to keep him would be
the roof. Accordingly, with the aid
of a rickety stepladder and the
local constabulary, the object of
so much desperate attention was
deposited on the porch roof, peer-
ing disdainfully down at its cap-
tors.

The victorious lion-hunters then
made a strategic withdrawal to bed,
chuckling over the irony of finding
their quarry under their very feet.

The incident: is not over, though,
and it is rumored that the campus
will soon become accustomed to
seeing a ferocious-looking cast iron
miniature lion decorating the lawn
of the SAE house, home of the
famed African-safari-hunters - de-
luxe,

Oldtimer Recalls
Wildcat’s Origin

(Following is a letter from Charles Montgomery, Davidson, '93,
received by Dr. Chalmers Davidson. For the furtherance of fact or
fable concerning the College's storied past. The Davidsonian passes
the story on to its readers.-—-Ed.)

Dear Sirr

As to the origin of the name
“Wildcats,” I can give you a little
story which may help out a little.

In the winter of '92-'93 a rumor
started on the campus of D.C.—
no one will ever know who started
it. Thus it ran: So and so, as he
was going from one building to an-
other at night, heard a wildcat or
bobeat scream. That cat screamed
from every nook and corner, night
by night, from the woods and little
stream he kept up his serenade, if
it could be called a serenade. No
one had ever seen him; as was his
nature, he prowled only at night.

Something had to be done. Nim
Hunter called his cohorts to his
room, Voss, Darrow (?) Lawrence
Mills are all I heard about; there
may have been more. Their glory
rests with them. No‘ one having
seen him, it wasn’t so hard to
fashion a wildcat, so with wire,
rags and a long cord the cat took
up existence, was put on ground
outside of Mill’s room, second floor
South; with the long cord running
to other side. It wasn't real dark
and at a given sign Mills ran
across the hall to Morrison Brown's
room, all agog, c#ying, “Brown,
that wildcat is on the outside of
my window; let me have your gun,

why they were elected.

One method by which we can
improve our system immediately is
by voting more on issues of general
interest in chapel. The decision by
‘the majority would be taken to the
faculty by the student body officers
who would request that the stu-
dent demands be met. If the stu-
dent demands were not met by the
faculty, a full report would be
given on their reasons for not con-
senting to the requisitions of the
students.

if the student body con-
aidered the faculty's decision as
unjustified, then the President
of the student body would ap.
peal to each student to write
his parents asking them to re-
quest the faculty to reverse
their decision,

This system may be nothing
more than a pressure proposition,
but it is interesting to consider, for
example, how many days the stu-
dent body would have gotten for
Thanksgiving holidays if this sys-
tem had been employed.

I consider it a black mark on
our student government to al-
low the Faculty-Student Con.
ference Committees to“become
inefficacious and useless.

If this committee had been at
the very least meeting for the past
year and a half, the student posi-
tion on issues of general interest
between the faculty and student
body would have been more lucid-

ly and vividly expounded. Not only |,

do I appeal to the student officers
to read the Constitution and educe
the full meaning and import of their
duties and obligations as officers,

quick.”

Mills knew that Brown bad a
gun, and knew also that he would
not let him have it, “No,” says
Brown, “I'll come and shoot him.”
So across the hall they run and
out the window popped their heads.
Sure enough there the cat was
waddling about. It took no time
to shoot. What jumping was then
done by the Cat! Brown had. only
one more shell. He let go with that
one. The cat moderated his leaps.
Brown and Mills had no more need
of the gun, so down the stairs and
out the back door they ran. And
as they turned the corner they ran
into the string Darrow was using
to make the cat jump.

Needless to say Brown was in his
room immediately,

Two shots at that time of night,

got every body in Chambers out.
They all gathered at Brown's room,
which was locked. After much per-
suasion he opened up ‘and lit into
Darrow, the string puller, They
had a nice little fight, but were
soon pulled apart. Those who would
forget were not permitted to, so
the cat stayed around D. C. until
the athletes needed a name, and
the next I knew “Wildcats” were
leading the athletes—C. M. ‘93.

Interviewers
Will Proffer

Seniors Jobs

Fifteen to twenty business firms,
many of them nationalt, known,
will visit the Davidson Campus this
spring in order to interview
seniors for jobs. Mr. John Dillon
asks that all seniors interested in
trying for one of these placement
jobs please check by his office in
104 Chambers before next Tuesday.

He asked that emphasis be
placed on the fact that any
senior, regardless of ROTC and
1-A status, may request an in-
terview, for the firms to be rep-
resented here ere looking for
many to hold positions after
their army discharge.

Almost every phase of industry
will be represented here this Spring
including Lockheed Aircraft Cor-
poration, Dan River Mills, Derring
Milliken Service Corporation, New
York Life Insurance Company, De-
partment of Revenue of North
Carolina, Standard Oil Company,
Colgate-Palmolive-Peet Company,
Southern Bell Telephone and Tele-
graph Company, and many other
smaller firms.

Dan River Mills and Lock-
heed Aircraft Corporation will
be here on February 18, and
graduating seniors who have
signed to be interviewed will be
notified a week in advance.

On February 18, they will meet
in a group for a general interview
after which will come the individual
ones, All of these companies
guarantee positions for men after
their discharge from the army if
that, be the case.

One -other point of emphasis
brought out by Mr. Dillon is that
these are not summer jobs but full
time, year-round ones.

PHI WELCOMES....

while Hebrew and Sanskrit received
some support.

It was announced that the United
Literary Film Society would pre-
sent four films this semester. They
will be “Pygmalion,” “The Mika-
do.” “The Grand Iusion” and
“Fame Ts a Spur.”

Hope was expressed that the
student body would take full
advantage of the excellent op-
portunity for both entertain-
ment and knowledge which
these films will undoubtedly of-
fer.

Mr. Shippey then spoke on the]
fallacy of the statement, “There's ..
Ford in Your Future,” and Mr. T.
A, Williams spoke on the applica.
tion to the laundry business of the
expression, “Together we stand, di-
vided we fall.”

females lost their faith in men dur-
ing the war when they met Ameri-
can flyers who were interned in our
country, .

If you ask a girl to go to church
with you, she will probably do it,
but unlike her American sisters,
she will not use the opportunity
only to show off her new hat.

No Popcorn

- There are a lot of things you
would miss when dating in Sweden.
You would miss the pleasant sound
of people chewing popcorn in the
picture-show and also many of the
hilarious Hollywood pictures that
make you forget thinking.

You would miss the wonderful,
understanding American parents
who have the education to disappear
as soon as you and your date enter
the living room.

But maybe you would be so
pleased with your little tobaggan
that you would bring it back with
you and maybe ask the girls at
Queens to drop dead. But remem-
ber, no tents,

(In order to bring to light
the activity of the YMCA cabi-.
net, The Davidsonian begins
this week the publication of the
minutes of the Tuesday night
cabinet meetings. —Ed.)

The meeting was opened with
the reading of the Scripture and
prayer lead by Plummer and Stock-
ton.

Strand called to the cabinet’s at-
tention a letter from the United
Student Christian Council asking
the cabinet to discuss the’ USCC’s
intent to join the National Coun.
cil of Churches. The cabinet post-
poned discussion and decision until
a later date in order for the mem-
bers to learh more about the situa.
tion.

The cabinet decided to meet on
February 12 to determine a criterion
for judging the qualifications for
cabinet members.

Strand announced that the re-
gional YMCA conference will be
held in Atlanta February 22, 23,
and 24, The Davidson cabinet is

to his press releases, especially in
the Cradle Song of Bernard Flies.

The eight-part harmony of Or-
lando de Lasso's Echo and Ga.
brielli’s Jubilate Deo Omnis Terra
was under control and handled with
confidence. These pieces, dating
from the sixteenth century, were
highpoints of the program mechan-
ically, Welcome, too, was the omis-
sion of Shubert’s Ave Maria in favor
of Ludovicus da Victoria's work on
the same theme.

Among the older boys, basso
Arvid Assen stood out in Mendels-
sohn's Hear My Prayer, and with
tenor Hans Glenne, in Santa Lucia
and the encore, Finiculi, Finicula.

In their concert here, the Sing-
ing Boys did not, to a provincial
reporter, measure up to Saint
Peter's or the Westminster boy
choirs of this country. However,
when one considers the strain they
were under and the unrelenting
strangeness of a new country, then
a typical performance could not
have been expected. Perhaps Con.
ductor Bjarne summed up the sit-
uation when he was complimented
on having ted ‘the project for
twenty-five years. “Twenty-five
years? Pah... ‘tis nozzing, Zir.

“y” CABINET MINUTES

With Senator Estes Kefauver
tentatively scheduled to open the
services with a Sunday afternoon
address, the Charlotte United
Preaching Mission will bring some
of the leading ministers and theolo-
gians in the East to this area the
week of March 2-9. |

Provided Kefauver 1s not confined
to Washington duties that week-
end, he will open the mission in the
Armory Auditorium Sunday, March
22, at 2:30. Speakers in the Armory

Dunning and Dr. A. MacKay. Dr.
Dunning, formerly of Leeds Univer-
sity in England, is a widely sought-
after preacher, evangelist, and Bible
teacher, Mr, MacKay, president of
Princeton Theological : Seminary,
ranks among the great scholars of
the nation, ;

In addition to the daily services,
daily evening services will be held
in the Armory at 7:30. Also meet-
ings for ministers are planned at
the First Presbyterian Church at
9:30 in the morning.

Special schedules are being ar-
ranged for the benefit of colleges,
civic groups and schools,

The list of outstanding church-
men in attendance includes:

DR, ALBERT P. SHIRKEY,
pastor of the large, influential Mt.

, since only $500 was left from
the Christmas Gift Fund after
$3000 was sent to the Caswell
Training School, Robinson sug-
gested that the remainder be sent
to only one place rather than be
split between the Negro Y and the
AFSC Project in India. The cabi-
net decided not to group the money.
into one project without the per-
mission of the student body. No
other action was taken pending
further investigation of how small
amounts of money would be used
in the two projects.

Cannon announced that an
open forum would be held on the
Gift Fund question on February 8.
Strand announced that a new post
on the cabinet would be created to
handle the Intercollegiate Coun-
cil, which would reduce Nickels’
responsibilities to community work.

The meeting was adjourned.

Solons To Hear
Lunch Hour Plea

At least one move proposed in
this morning's chapel has been as-
sured quick faculty attention. Dean
C. K. Brown promised George
Knight the lunch hour petition will
be reviewed soon by the Executive
Committee. He warned that. all
names must be genuine and the
legality of the paper's other aspects
must be preserved.

tution which would allow that
future amendments to the Con-
stitution come from the student
‘body at large and, as at pres-
ent, through the Student Coun-
cil.

McLean wanted to hold off
Brinkley’s amendment and bring it
up after the matter had been dis.
cussed by the students and the
Council.

George Nichols, a member‘ of last
year’s football team, gave briefly
his own opinions concerning ath-
letic subsidization at Davidson and
the inadequacies of the coaching
staff.

Longer Holidays?

The subject of holidays was
brought up by McLean ,who said
there were only two possible ways
to get more or longer holidays.
School could either start earlier in
the fall, or get out later in the
spring. Emphasizing the point that
180 class days are mandatory, Mc-
Lean allowed a series of students
that included Vernon Clifton,
Vance Mizelle, Sammy Hope, Bob
Loy, and John Cathcart to express
Opinions that varied from finishing
the first semester before Christmas
holidays began to a lengthening of
the spring holidays of this year.

Following the chapel, McLean
said that he thought the first meet-
ing had been a success and that he
planned having several others be-
fore the end of the year.

signed as yet. Tom pointed out that
while no “name” band will be on
hand, an equally good outfit will be
signed to provide music for the
dancing,

With no conflicting fraternity
functions or athletic contests that
weekend, a good turn out is antici-
pated by the planning officers—
Stockton, vice-president Eric Clark,
and secretary-treasurer Bill
Buckey. Tickets will be placed on
sale the latter part of this month.
