Davidson Defeats Wake|Town Items of the Week|Opening of the Davidson|Davidson Almost Tri-

Forest in Debate.

Wins Cup by Second Victory at
Winston-Salem.

The second debate of the series with
Wake Forest in competition for the cup
offered by the Winston-Salem Board of
Trade and Salem College, was held in

the Memorial Hall, Salem College.
Winston-Salem, at 8:30 last night.
April 13.

Mr. R. H. Latham, of the Winston-
Salem schools. presided. After the en-

trance of the debaters upon the stage}.

to the march plaved on.the pipe organ
by Miss A. Sorsbv, the exercises were
opened with a praver by Dr. H. E.
Rondthaler.

The question for debate was: ‘“Re-
solved, Fhat all candidates forzelective
offices in North Carolina should be
naminated by direct primary modeled
after the Wisconsin plan, rather than by

the convention system.” The affirma-|"

tive was upheld by Davidson, represent-
ed by H. M. Marvin and C. L. King,
with F. H. Smith as alternate. The
necative was upheld by Wake Forest.
reprecented by J. M. Pritchard and EF.
P. Yates, with J. P. Mull as alternate.

The first speaker. Mr. Marvin. be-
gan his speech by clearly outlining and
showing the differences between the svys-
tem which now exists and the Wisconsin
direct primary system. He pointed out
thar the duty of the negative was not to
defend the existing convention system
in North Carolina, but the convention
svstem as a whole. He then showed
that the convention svstem ts inadequate :

First. because it is not representative
of the people. because the voter can only
select the delegates to the county con-

vention, who in tur select other dele-
gates to the State c pin these dele-
gates in no case being pledged to sup-

port any particular candidate. Conse-
guently the voter has little voice in
choosing the nominees for office.

Again. the convention svstem, ts not
representative of the peopie becatise such
a small proportion of the voters who
vote in the final elections vote in the
primaries. this statement being borne
out by several striking examples. The
convention system is not representative,
ton, because the convention is not in
stricted, nor is it a deliberative body.

Second: because the convention can
be dominated by a boss.
cited of the methods .used to overrule
motions or ignore votes.

Third, because North Carolina can
never realize the full benefits of the
democratic government unless _her
people are interested in elections. Un-
der the convention system there is little
interest, because the voter realizes how
little his vote can accomplish. Not that
North Carolina has failed with the con-
vention system, but that new conditions
are arising, large corporations are enter-
ing the State and she needs‘the new sys-
tem for her new needs. Mr. Marvin
also made the statement that in answer
to personal letters, everv North Caro-
lina Congressman had declared himself
in favor of the direct primary system.

Mr. Pritchard opened the debate for
the negative with a statement of the
success of the convention system In
North Carolina for the past hundred.
vears. He then. before going on with
his proof, stated the points which the
negative claimed must be proved by the
affirmative, namely, that the convention
system in North Carolina has been a
hopeless failure and that the direct pri-
mary is the remedy for this failure. He
then went on to show that the conven-

FIELD DAY.

Saturday. April 18. is the date set
apart for the Annual Field Dav at
Sprunt Field. “This vear the competi-
tion should be very keen, with the Sophs
and Juniors having a slight advantage.
Every student should be our with en-

|thusiasm and spirit and back his class.
Several of the records belaw are expect-
ed to be broken. The officials have not
vet been selected, but Dr. Arbuckle, Dr.
J. W. McConngll, Dr. J. M. Douglass
will probably be among those sclecad.
An invitation will be sent to the Queens
College student body, and their presence
will add pleasure and zest to the day.
As usual, a whole holiday will be grant-
ed. and one of the best Field Days
should be held this week.

“ON TO CHARLOTTE.”

Let the above be the by-word for the
U. of N. C. game to be plaved intChar-
lotte on Tuesday. April 21. The Faculty
has granted one-half dav off for the
game down there, and as this is the only
game with this team, and will be the
best game on the schedule, everv student,
and every member of the Faculty must
be there to back up the Red and Black
machine. “On to Charlotte!”

College Golf Course.

Mr. T. Bonnar, of Scotland. and
Mr. W. H. Paul, of the Mecklenburg
Country Club,) gave the Davidson Golf
Club a splendid send off in a verv close
and exciting exhibition game on Satur-
day afternoon, April 11. The weather
was ideal and the gallery was a large
and enthusiastic one, following the game
with great interest from start to finish.
Considering the fact that the Fair
Greens are as yet in rough condition and
the Putting Greens quite uneven, the
game was as fine exhibition of golf as
we ever see.

The game was won by Mr. Bonnar
in 82. Mr. Paul finished in 83, but
made it about even by taking the sec-
ond nine holes in 38, which is within
one of Bogey. x

The Davidson College Golf Club has
just been organized this spring. “The
following officers were elected: H. B.
Arbuckle, president; A. Currie, secre:
tary; and J. Moore. McConnell, treas-
urer. The rapiditv with which the

course was gotten into shape for play is

due to the support the officers of the club
have received from the College students,
who turned out forty strong to work
on the course.

The Golf Club should mean much to
this community and the College. ‘Vhe
officers of the club are particularly. in-
terested in bringing the students into the
club and have extended to them most
liberal terms. “The admission and up-
keep fee for college students is only $3,
payable on entrance. For those who
join this spring the treastirer will give
a credit of $2 on next session's fee. Any
student can play the game very well
with three clubs, which can be bought
from the club for $5. No college in
the South is at present sending out a
golf team, and it will mean much to
Davidson and to the students to be rep-

‘resented in a few of our Southern tour-

naments next year.

The distance of the course in vards:
1 2 3 4.5 6 7 8 9
235 120 174 272 440 222 190 132 255
—2050

The game was eighteens holes, two
rounds of the course, and was very’
close from start to finish. On the first
round Mr. Paul was unfortunate in
driving two balls out of bounds on the
second hole and two balls out of bounds
on the fifth hole. In spite of thi< he
won three holes and halved two. On
the second round he recovered himself
nicely, taking two holes‘in three strokes,
and making four holes in four strokes.
The beautiful driving of Mr. Bonnar
and the marveloug mid iron shots of
Mr. Paul drew frequent applause from
the gallery. A few of Mr. Paul’s putts
were great, considering the condition of
Putting Greens.

ANNUAL COMING SOON.

“Quips and Cranks” is expected to
appear the first of the next week. There
will be only a limited number of extra
copies, and orders should be placed for
these at once hy those who have not al-
ready ordered their Annuals. Orders
should be placed with E. Q. Pharr, J.
E. Faw or W. Morrison. The
“Quips and Cranks” of 1914 promises
to be one of the best and most interest-
ing ever published by Davidson. H. M.
Marvin has been a hard-working editor,
and many have assisted him faithfully.
Every man in college should own a
copy, not only for his own immediate
pleasure and the pleasure of the friends
at home. but for the pleasure it will give
him in future vears when we wishes to
review the memories of “college days.”

TRINITY GAME.
On Wednesday, Davidson outplayed

the Methodist lads in every stage of the
game, but as has been the case in the
last four games, luck broke the other
way. The Red and Blacks had. 14 left
on bases and several times 3 on, and
although 10 bingles were registered, still
when one was really needed it could not
be found. Trinity certainly plaved with
“horse-shoes in. their pockets.” The
soft sandy infield proved a great handi-
cap ta the Davidson. infielders, who
were used to a fast hard diamond. Of
Vrinity's § hits.g of them were infield
hits which could have been cut off on
the Sprunt Athletic diamond. ‘The
umps was very much off and “stung”.
Davidson several times on bases, and on
many strikes. No one who saw the
game hesitated to sav that with only a
mediocre bit of tuck Davidson would
have won by a good margin.

Davidson scored in the seventh. After
Christy had hit a two-bagger, and ad-
vanced on Kluttz’s out, he scored on
Cravton’s ball. which was errored by
the pitcher. The second. run came in
the ninth, when Kluttz was safe on in-
field hit, stole second and advanced to
third on Cravton’s hit. “Then .Stough
poled the next one out for three sacks,
Kluttz scoring and Pete being caught at
the plate. Osteen was safe on first, but
the next batter struck out and retired
the side. In the second there were two
on and none down, but the next three
flied out. In the sixth the bases, were
drunk, but the next batter fanned.
the eighth the sacks were loaded, but a
double play from home to first cut off
the scores here. Trinity scored two in
the second—two getting safe on infield
grounders, and one walking. The next
batter bunted down third base line, and
