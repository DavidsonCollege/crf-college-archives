Mills Gracious

Despite Defeat

By ERNIE SHIPE
Sports Editor

To talk to Lewis ‘Mills you
would never guess his Rich-

mond Spiders walked away

from Johnston Gym a loser
Tuesday night.

Although ‘Richmond is 1-5
for the season, he constant-
ly radiated enthusiasm. He
even got the biggest ova-
tion of the entire game
when he followed the Spid-
ers into the gym.

No one on his ball club
played what you might call
an outstanding game in their
67-54 loss. This is probably
why you see [Mills face de-
corating Richmond _ basket-
ball brochures instead of any
member of his ball club.

Even in losing thé other
night the baldish young
coach doesn't count his Spi-
ders out of the conference
race.

‘Davidson, East Carolina,
and Furman seem to be the
front runners now," Mills
said, ‘‘but don’t .count us
out. We've got a young ball
club and we're looking for-
ward to January when we
should be getting pretty
tough.”’

“IT have a lot of respect
for Coach Holland and his
boys,” he added. ‘‘They
looked good against us to-
night and should have a fine
season,’

(Mills could. have had an
easy alibi for his.loss to the
‘Cats but scoffed it off. Stan
Ryfinski, the Spider’s se-
cond scorer, missed the con-
test because of the flu.

“Of course we! missed
Stan, but he has been alter-
nating in the starting line-
up with John Welch.”

(Mills felt his club’s poor

ball “handling hurt them in—

the—Joss.-.The Spiders. .com-

mitted 25 floor -mistake.
The Spiders were in. strik-

ing distance of the 'Cats

through nearly all‘ of the
forty minutes. At half they
only trailed 32.27 after lead-
ing the Wildcats for the
first. twelve minutes of the
ball game.

Davidson slowly built their

, lead in the opening minutes

of the second half, but the
Spiders rallied with 7:15 left
to cut the lead to 50-47.

The Wildcats, however,
rallied to outscore the Spi-
ders 17-7 in the closing se-
ven minutes.

Joe Sutter ignited the sec-
ond half surge. After being
held to eight points in the
first half he finished strong
ending the evening with 22.
His showing brought his
season average to 20.3.

The win brought the Wild-
cat's conference record to
2-0 and gave them a 3-0 mark
overall,

Even though the ‘Wildcats

- have a firm hold on the con-
f ference

lead » the picture
seems ever brighter consid-

‘ering! what the Wildkittens

did to Gaston College in the
preliminary.

The freshmen exploded for
62 points in the second half
to outscore Gaston, 117-101.
It was the first time either
of the Davidson teams have
broken the century mark.

John Falconi,
ner, and Steve Gadaire did
most of the damage. Falconi
was good for 32 points while

‘Wagner and Gadaire hit 27

and 24 respectively.

Holland Remains Optimist

By JOE EARLE
Asst. Sports Editor

Terry Holland ‘is’ very
optimistic about this year's

_ basketball season.

After rolling over both
‘Mereer and ‘East Carolina,
a team pickéd by some to
challenge Davidson's tradi-
tional superiority in the
Southern Conference, Hol-
land says he sees no reason
why the ‘Cats should not
bring the conference crown
back to Davidson.

(Holland also feels that the
‘Cats should maintain their

fourth consecutive twenty-
win season.
Perhaps this seems a

brash prediction for a team
that is missing two starters
of the calibre of Brian A-
drian and Eric Minkin, but
Holland is optimistic.
‘(Minkin played for a short
period during the. Mercer
game and Adrian is expect-
ed back by the beginning of
the Christmas tournament,
but Holland says
players who have played in
the first games have earned
their starting positions.
“The pressure is now on

SC Adopts
At Winter

In a meeting last. week
the Southern Conference set
up limi.ations on = grant-in-

aids for both football and
basketball,

‘At the thrce day meeting,
school and conference repre-

sentatives set limits of 100

football grants and 20. bas-
ketball grants to begin at
the start of the 1973-74

academic year.

According to Athletic Di
rector Tom Scott, the ruling

states that each partial
grant will count as one
grant.

Scott explained that David-
son wanted to have the foot-
ball limitation set at 75,
Presently Davidson gives 52
football and) 18 -+askethball
grants. Many athletes, how-
ever, are on partial grants.

Scott felt the decision
could hurt Davidson as other
schools with more resources
could give 100 grants while
Davidson could only hope to
reach 75.

(Presently the:
raising the funds for foot-
ball scholarships is headed
by the Wildcat Club.

Steve Heckard, who is
heading the drive, said that

“They have proved themsel-
ves under pressure, and are
a fine team.”

‘Our biggest problem _ is
that we are slow,’’ he said.

and maintain the lead, for

‘The ‘Cats have a full
schedule ahead of them dur-
ing holidays, with a total of
seven games to be played.

After tackling Georgia and
North Carolina’ State, they
will play ifthe Charlotte
Invitational  Tourna-
ment against Boston, La
Salle, and Georgia.

After the tournament the
‘Cats square off against Wil-
liam and Mary and Furman,
two more teams  forcasted
to challenge the — confer-
ence title, and West Virginia.

Holland said he felt that
the West Virginia
would be one of the key
games of the season.

West Virginia has aver-
aged over a hundred points
a game," he said; ‘‘and that
game on Jan. 9 should be an
exciting as’ well as:an im-
portant contest for us.”

Holland stressed West Vir-
ginia's’ record thus far in
the season, particularly

their close loss to highly re- ~~

garded Kentucky, and
expressed desire for students
to return to see that game
in the Coliseum,

‘Holland was impressed
with the play of the team in
the first two games. ‘‘Al-
though we have no really
tall men, we have good over-
all height,"’ he commented,
“and this forces us to work
to tha, free inside man.’

“The fact that, we have so
many free throws indicates
that we are getting inside,”
he said. i

The ‘Wildcats have done
well from the foul line, hitt-
ing 74 per cent during the
Mercer game.’
