Large Student SRody . . .

Dr. Chalmers Davidson’s recent, de-
lightful chapel talk on the advisability of
reducing the size of the student body to
pre-war dimensions and the approaching
meeting of the Trustees of Davidson Col-
lege have focused a good deal of attention
on this controversial topic.

Rather than engage in pitched battle
with the keeper of traditions on Peter
Stuart Ney, it seems safer to present a few
of the possible advantages of a student
body numbered about one thousand.
Foremost in the mind of. the student is
the prestige attached to a college which can
win football games and basketball tourna-
ments. The success of this year’s cage
squad and the hopes pinned on it and on
other teams in the next few years are
ample testimony to the fact that with
increased material to draw from better
teams may be had.

In intellectual fields, an increased num-
ber of pupils requires a larger number of
professors, offering different viewpoints
and wider range of interest and specialty.
Also to be expected are improved labora-
tory’ facilities, an expanded curriculum,
and even more pretty girls working in the
various offices of the administration.

An eminent, nationally famous college
would attract increasing amounts of
financial backing, both from philanthro-
pists, happy to serve humanity by giving
money to an institution widely known for
the sound principles of its foundation, and
from greater numbers of pleased and
financially benevolent alumni.

A classic criticism of the large school
has been the great gulf existing between
students and faculty under such a system.
Without polishing the apple ‘too vigorious-
ly it may be said that Davidson professors
are nearly to the last man so personally
enjoyable as. to insure close social: rela-
tions between the two groups. No decrease
in cordial feeling has been noted with the
present large number of students.

As a matter of fact it may be that’ the
influence over a small student body held
by a faculty. which knows all the students
intimately is of questionable value, Dr.
Gallent’s refrain, “You boys are spoon-
fed,” is a matter of laughable absurdity
as regards chemistry, but may approach
in social and religious fields. A serious
criticism of the college has been, ‘Send
your boy to Davidson and_we’ll-send-your
boy back.” A larger student body should
mean more room for the individual to

grow. =
Dr. Davidson neatly suggested that by

reducing the number of students the
college’s facilities would not be overtaxed
in his warning not to “stretch Solomon
too far.” It seems to us. that besides his
method of cutting down on the number of
Solomon’s wives there is the possibility of
having a bigger, more potent Solomon.

Letters To’The
Editor ....

Editor

The Davidsonian
Davidson, -N.—C.
Dear Editor:

Throughout my years here at Davidson
I have been rather painfully aware of the
excessive noise in and about the dormi-
tories during study and sleep hours, which
period of time is by definition from sup-
per to breakfast. Students clomp and pa-
rade through the halls of dorms shouting,
singing, and whistling at any hour and at
all hours, apparently blissfully unaware
that on all sides of them fellows are either
trying to study or to sleep.

To those who have any powers of ob-
servation it is evident that all one door
will screen is vision, while two very ef-
fectively screen noise. Thus it is though
one whistled and sang through rows of
sleeping and studying people with no walls
between; and were there no walls, you
may be sure that the books and boots would
fly fast‘ and thick. Yet the student in-
variably waits until he is the hall before
he begins his raucous melody.

And what is equally surprising to me is
the assumption that this tryanny of «noise
cannot be combatted, an assumption that
seems as antiquated as bloodletting, as
senseless as fascism. As long as the effort
for quiet is confined to whispers of their
complaint among the quiet, there shall be
no quiet!

_Let it be clearly understood that the noise
is no minor handicap to the functioning and
purpose of this educational institution. Ex-
traneous noises make gaining book knowledge
much more effortful, and in cases of especially
profound work, impossible. And the same
applies to sleep, which, and make no mistake
about it, is every bit as important as food
and drink. Animals die just as readily from
lack of it as from lack of food and water.
Lack of sleep also necessitates a greater ex-
penditure of energy to accomplish the day’s
work. 4
Some students go without breakfast,
and though this seems folly, -it is their
privilege. But it is not their privilege to
keep everyone else from going to break-
fast. Is it anymore the privilege of those
who allege only six hours of sleep to be
necessary for them, to rule six hours the
maximum for all? _

The gist of the situation is that all rea-
son is on the side of thoughtful quietness,
while the practice is all,on the other side.
Why not remedy the situation. We even
have the law on this side:/

ARTICLE VIII — Section 10 of Student
Body Regulations: No student shall be guilty
of making unnecessary noise or interfering
with st@dying conditions in the dormitories.
Section 14 — Every student found guilty of
violating Section 10 shall be subject to re-
moval from the dormitories to other lodgings.
at the discretion of the Student Council.

This sort of thing is not allowed in
hotels or: rooming houses. Is the work
and world of the student less important
than that of the outside world? I think
not!

Breezin’

With
Bob

BY BOB RIERSON

With the time drawing closer and
closer, the Davidson students. be-
gan to squirm in their chapel seats:
Assignments grew heavy on their
hands, and they found themselves
dreaming of what was to come.
Wednesday brought with it, pleas-
antly enough, a brand-new silver
dollar of a moon, which immediate-

|ly was greeted by overflowings of

joy and affection, but, not so pleas-
antly,;-was-followed-by a-cold-front
that withered the hopes of the car-
less and caused even the mechani-
zed to haul out their Communist-
tainted long woolies. The weather
continued, but the fervor was un-
abated, and come last Friday after-
noon, books were cast aside in
favor of numerous  scrubbings,
shavings, shinings, and sprucings,
and then the long road to the Queen
(?) City (?) of the Southland*was
hit-but hard!

Yep, tha’s right, ye olde Mid-
winteres were fast underway, and
moonings of the past few weeks
were realized. The feminine gend-
er had provided its representation
for the events at hand, and no one
was dissatisfied (it says here where
one of the afore-mentioned might
chance upon it!). All followed their
collective noses ot the Charlotte
Hotel ballroom, and many were the
electrically-heated union suits that
kept their occupants warmed while
on the way (from then on Dean
Hudson and the beauteous delega-
tion were in charge—woe betide the
poor stags!) After four hours of
frame-trading for  terpsichorean
struggles, the shindig (that sublime
triteness will, I trust, be overlook-
ed) broke up, the girls went to their
newspapers and bobby-pins, and
their manly dates doubtless return-
ed ,to their humble domiciles to
spend the two remaining. pre-dawn
hours getting the studies up which
they had neglected to go to the
dance.

The clanging of the eight-twenty

five bell found many noble sons of
David in excellent shape for their
expected duty on Saturday morn
after returning on that same Satur-
day morn, nay, only two hours be-
fore. Much undivided attention
was given on that morn, to what
I shall not venture to say. But
interest in the world at large pro-
foundly increased along about five
in the afternoon. Morpheus had
departted— until Monday morning,
and the dealers swung into action
once again. Everything from Ply-
mouths to Pierce-Arrows, from
Chevrolets to Cadillacs constituted
the long line between hyar and thar.

Saturday night was the time for
the guys to let their hair down and
doff dress to don drapes. But the
gals were not so lucky and made an
encore appearance in the radiant
rags of divine dress. All made—it
through despite the long space be-
tween naps, althought there was
much railing and smashing of feet
before the last note had died. The
luckless males were in for still more
though, and while the girls held
their bare shoulders in the icy
blasts, the heroes patiently awaited
their turn to secure wraps, show-
ing perseverance equalled only by
their conduct ten minutes before
an exam for which they have
studied half an hour.

May we gracefully (or -lessly)
slide over the remainder of the
night? Suffice it to say that no
one has ‘yet recovered from the
shortage of sacktime, not to men-
tion certain other aspects of the
weekend. Likewise no one regrets
anything, but rather is very pleased
with the whole deal. The orchestra
was swell, the women lovely, all’s
right with the world, thanks be to
“Buddy Bone” and his able lot of
hirelings. But yours truly, having
roused himself from a deep sleep
to meet a deadline, now begs to be
allowed to return from whence he
came—for another week at least.

The Operating _ Table

Us

The Bone is too busy at press
time to furnish a story on the rel-
ative success of the dances. While
hreathlessly stumbling into the
catacombs of Rumple in an effort
to shake off the bloodhounds sent
out by the Bureau of Internal Rev-
enue and the long line of Milwaukee
boys seeking to sign up as Spring
Set decorators, the Austrian fugi-
tive could mutter but a single line:
“The week end was strictly Pan-
Hell.”

It should have been. Never be-
fore have the cloistered halls seen
so strange and conspicuous a gath-
ering of guésts. The Texas boys
(Atomic Powell, Mt. Vernon Mc-
Gehee, etc.) even brought in a
herd of cattle to keep a homey
atmosphere about the campus, but
the herd disappeared after being
traced to a point midway between
Chambers and Hugo’s, on the post
office trail. .

The Armory was well decorated,
too, and in like manner should have
been. The decorating committee
was “headed” by several prominent
members of the artistic branch of
the student body. Infact, the case
on hand divulged a variety of
heads. T. Wendell Knox, the Crys-
tal Ball Grazer, stumbled on a new
way of completing the paper-hang-
ing.. Riddervoltage was high (big
stepladder) and vied with Footsie
for top honors. Hockey Lee and Rab
were hanging a lot of crepe, by the
rafters, and Dana the Drana man-
aged to lower a few streamers him-
self.

Davidson’s Brass Hats (who have
modestly dubbed themselves the
Alpha Sigs) threw a military brawl

stooping to straighten the wrinkle
from his pinks, one of the War
Lords confessed that the function
was worthy of the conduct and
presence of the gentlemen present.

Ruddy Robert Phillips and the
Paratrooper (Thompson) spent the
week end searching for four more
like Philip Morris’ Johnny so that
the latter could prove: his skill to
Petey. After an evening or two of
social calls and duties, including e
stop at the buzzing office of the
local magazine, where Phillips en-
tertained the group with stories of
the birds and bees. Censored.
Censored.

Amos Ragan wins the achieve-
ment-award-of-the-week,-although
he was pressed closely for the top,
position by his date. The Neill
brothers, Bayru and Bamboo, were
in close attendance with Melio and
Hammond not so close. Hammond
wins the radio award. It was a
smashing victory.

George Mackie Grimbell was seen
quoting poetry and wishing each
and all well both during and after
the dances. Hugh Hill, the boy
with the smiling face and hearty
handshake, was spotted in all the
more conspicuous places over the
week end.

The Betas asked to be mentioned
this week end, so at this time we
mention the BETA’s.

KAPPA SIGMA

Delta Chapter played host to a
superb group of lovelies for the
week end, and in their company
enjoyed the dances and atttendant
festivities (as in festive Doug).
The latter by the way has made
six trips to Mooresville Appliances
Corp. in search of replacements for
certain shower fixtures.

Most disastrous entanglement of¢
the campaign caught Charlie Jar-
ret, who invited three different
women from three different Vir-
ginia schools, one of whom finally
accepted. Unfortunately, the two
negators were down with other
dates, and Charlie fears for his
own security since the three re
turned to Virginia in the same car.
Robert “The Rag" Walker Friday
night learned too late the hazards
of curiosity.

Gregg Thompson came up Sun-
day morning with a fantastic story
of giving outa gas on the way back
from the dance—likely tale.

Taylor and Currié squired the
lovely two Colemans, while “Leap:
er” Lawson gloried in the presence
of his elusive Dukster. John
McDonald entertained a_ sizeable
portion of the chapter at his home
after the Saturday dance. Brother
Philips reports an uneventful week
end. d

PHI DELTA THETA

Operations in the N. C. Gamma
chapter were augmented this week
by the Mid-Winters dance set as
most of the_Brothers could be seen
in the Queen City for the festivities. |
Brothers not present for the dances
included Iverson, Mills and Cobb
who were with the Wildcat quin-
tet in Durham and Chapel Hill.

Brothers Starnes and Oglesby
turned up at the dances with two
new lovelies whom the chapter had
never seen before. Brother Mc-
Lean seems to have fared well with
his semi-blind date from Raleigh,
while Brother Archer pulled top
honors of the week with a visitor
all the way from Washington, D. C.
Brother Sutton has suddenly be-
come a fiend on the subject of
canoes and talks of nothing but
rowin’. Brother Spangler says that
everything is cricket and Brother
Adams~as~usual~hasn’t said any-
thing sensible.

PI KAPPA PHI
Mid-Winters found the Pi Kapps
in all their glory and willing to
start the new semester off right.
At the time of this writing some

some: “Most Honorable Soakhead”
Hunter, “Digit” Edwards, and “Ap-
ple Blossom Time” Cline. We were
glad to have at the dances, Bro-
thers Calhoun Hipp and Price Line-
berger. We are always glad when
they visit us, because they really
know how to entertain. Huh! Fel-
lows? Rumors have it that: Why
doesn't Brother Tommy Bumbarger
like tea? What did Shakespeare
Nutall want Brother Cox to let him
do? Shame, “Cam”. Since when
did the Quonset Hut Corpora-
tion employ Brother Higgenbotham
as salesman? Brother “Squirel”
Barksdale showed up with a beauty
from Queens—where’s she been hid-
ing? Is Brother Moore trying to
steal Brother Edward’s Salem girl?
Brother Robertson sure turned out
to be a pal, didn’t he “Fitz”—or
are you complaining? We don’t
think so! Brother “Fuzz” Cox did
not get invited to the Salem dances
next week. Slipping Cox?

BETA THETA PI

The Beta house has seen much
activity this week, with the dances
followed by “hell week,” and initia-
tion tonight. Several of the new
brothers will be proudly displaying
their pins at Queens, Salem, and
other schools tomorrow night.

Midwinters was very successful,
‘and notable in its absence of flushes
and obviously blind dates. The fra-
ternity gathered at the Ship Ahoy
Friday night for a steak dinner
accompanied by the numerous wit-
ticisms of faculty brothers Winn
and Cunningham. An added attrac-
tion was a solo by “Box-head”
Smith. It was discovered at the
feed later that brother Jim Pitman
had pinned up this year’s Phi Alpha
girl, Miss, Barbara Coith.

Brother Schmidt plans to pay his
way through school with blackmail
money received for some clioice
“candid” camera shots Friday
night, one being that of brother
Edwards _ bird-dogging —-Scarbor-
ough’s date. A hearty welcome was
given to brothers Jim Satterfield,
and Frank and John Sherrill when
they came to visit the “home fort.”

PHI GAMMA DELTA

Immediately after the dance
week end it was announced by the
Ragan Knitting Mills of Thomas:
ville, N. C., that at the request of
the owner _their spring line--will
feature a group of teen-age dresses
especially designed for attractive-
ness both off and on on the campus.

Brother Dick O’Hair was ob-
served leaving school Monday to

have not quite recovered fully from
the late hours, ete. To mention
