Native American Churchill Says "Forget the Fairytale"
Lecturer Offers "Indiginest View of America Since 1 17 ‘6

By Kelly M. Dixson

The traditional view of the
Spanish Conquestresemblesa fairy
tale: Columbus sailed the ocean
blue and “discovered” a wonderful
new world. However, on Tuesday,
April 6 in the 900 Room, the Cen-
ter for Special Studies, Committee
on Public lectures, Dean Rusk Pro-
gram, Department of Anthropol-
ogy. and Sociology, and Phi Beta
Kappa, Gammachapter, sponsored
a presentation by Dr. Ward
Churchill, a Native American au-
thor and critic who presented a
very different view of the Con-
quest. Dr. Churchill is presently at
the Center for Studies of Ethnicity
and Race in America at the Uni-
versity of Colorado, Boulder. Dr.
Grant Jones introduced him as an
academic and activist, as well as a
self-described “international
trouble maker.”

Dr. Churchill’s speech, en-
titled “When the Predator Came:
AnIndigenist View of Native North
America Since 1492,” focused on
the effects of the Columbian ar-
rival. He characterized Christo-
pher Columbus and his men as
predators, but emphasized that the
term predator is not interchange-
able with any specific group such
as caucasian or European.

Dr. Churchill reminded the

audience that Columbus and his
men were not the first Europeans
to arrive in the Americas, but they
were the first to settle and conquer
the area in such a way as to destroy
the land, the population, and the
natural order of the continent. He
described the Conquest claiming,
“It was nota process of settlement,

"[Columbus' conquest
of the New World]
was not a process of
settlement, it was a
process of genocide."

it was a process of genocide.” He
declared that there was a ninety-
eight percent Indian population
reduction as a result of the
Columbian arrival, and that this
reduction is unparalleled in history
in terms of its magnitude.

Dr. Churchill discussed the
traditional view that three fourths
of the Indian deaths ocurred as a
result of diseases such as small-
pox, typhoid, and influenza. Many
scholars have seen disease as an
unintentional process, therefore
taking away from the culpability
of the European settlers. Dr.

Churchill, however, explained that
the settlers observed that the dis-
eases that they brought killed the
Indians, yetthey continued to settle
the area and even accelerated thé
process. Therefore, he claimed,
the settlers were not innocent.

He recounted several cases in
which commanders of conquering
armies intentionally distributed
contaminated items to the Indians
with the intention of spreading dis-
ease, stating, “These were
excercises in biological warfare for
the express purpose of exterminat-
ing the opposition.”

In order to explain the deaths
of the twenty-five percent of the
population that were not related to
disease, Dr. Churchill offered in-
formation about, the encomienda
system in which Indians and their
land and the destruction of their
environment. Dr. Churchill ended
his talk by affirming that the preda-
tor.attitude is a state of mind and
that people are not born into the
predator mindset, but are condi-
tioned to be predators. He encour-
aged the audience to educate them-
selves and to condition their own
consciousness. Finally, he ex-
pressed his desire for people to
feel a sense of responsibility to
eliminate the misconception about
the Columbian Conquest.

responded, “Folks will say it is
patently unfair, but we would have
to redo the whole women’s lot-
tery.”

Further, not even included in
this mini-lottery are the more than
40 men on the waiting list. Terry,
however, says notto worry, that he
expects campus housing to open
up for the 20 women who will
remain on the waiting list, as well
as for the 40 men.. He made the
final decision to make 2nd Watts a
women’s hall for a few reasons.
One, if he had put those women
down the hill it would have fur-
thered the disproportional gender
allocation already present with the
conversion of Ist Irwin. The hall
ratio down the hill now stands at
four halls for women to two for
men. Also, more men have re-

quested permission to live offcam-
pus than women, and if worse
comes to worst Terry, likes tohave
flexibility with the men: “If it is
absolutely necessary, I’d rather
force men off campus than women
for security reasons.”

Freshman Philip Parks says,
“Itsucks that we don’tknow where
we’re gonna live and our cluster is
broken up. Richard Terry said we
might even have to split up room-
mates.” Freshman Isaac Squires
asked, “Why is it so hard to get off
campus if there are so many people
on the waiting list?” Terry re-
sponded by saying that they have
to be very careful, because they do
not know which rising juniors will
not be on campus next year, which
students will not return, or what
the freshman matriculation will be.

“Tt’s not just a matter of add-
ing; its like shooting at shadows,”

says Terry. They have restricted
off-campus housing tothe 120 they
had last year, which may or may
notincrease, depending upon attri-
tion. They have to, however, guar-
antee at least 96% occupancy, or
Terry says there would be insuffi-
cient funds for the operating bud-
get of Residence Life.

As to future changes in resi-
dence plans, Terry is considering,
in addition to a new dorm esti-
mated tobegin construction in 1994
or 1995, a variety of possible op-
tions. He is looking at the result of
the change in this year’s clustering
policy, as well as other possible
configurations of the dorms, even
a possibility of a coed Belk dorm;
Terry remembers that when he at-
tended Davidson in the 1970s that
Belk was coed for one year. Stu-
dents are free to. submit any new
lottery plans they may have.

We've plenty of choices in campus wear,
and great selections for Him or for Her for
that upcoming interview.
