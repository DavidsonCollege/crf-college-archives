Blue Pencil Club
Organized for Work

To Promote More Effective Liter-
ary Work.

The Blue Pencil Club, composed of
those who are interested in writing and
literature and who, perhaps, may have
some literary aspirations, has been or-
ganized at Davidson. As the
would indicate, the membership will he
compused of those who would criticise
literary productions, as well as those who
write for the various college publica-
tions.

The first meeting was held on last
Wednesday evening and = plans were
made for the Spring meetings, which for
atime, at least: will be held once each
month. “Phe abject uf the club, as out-
lined, will be “Po promote effective lit
erary work among the students.” Tt is
felt that an organization of this kind
will be able to centralize the work of
those interested in the college publica-

tions and that it will be mutually help |

ful to it's members.

One of the features of the organiza
tion is that certain members of the fac
ulty have been invited to be present and
take an active part. “Vhis. they have
agreed to do, and Drs. Sentelle and Ful
ton were present at the last meeting
Dr. J. W. McConnell was aumable to
attend on account of sickness.

There shall be two elections of mem
bers cach vear. One of these clection
will be of members from the  Tunio
class. on the first Monday in March
and the other clection will be from th:
Senior class, on the second Monday i
Getober.

Clubs of this character have been ot
ganized in several of the Southern Col
leges and in practically all of the North
ern institutions. The meetings will be
informal gatherings. with generally some
certain topic for papers and discussion
and it is planned that coffee and cand
wiches served during the evening will be
a part of each prowram.

Thoee present last Wednesday night
were FLOW. Price TB. Faw. U.S.
Alexander. Stuart Gilchrist, G. W. Gia-

heavier line and a faster back tield, to
he shghtly stronger on the offensive: At
the end ob the quarter the -ball was in
possession at the Juniors on the Fresh
24 vard line.

with renewed vim. A succession of line
plunges by Neisler, Minter. MeNeill,
and Crawford, brought the ball te the
Fresh oy ovard dine. Here the Fresh,
seeing, their goal seriously menaced,
hraced up, held the Juniors tight, and
the ball went over. Crouch punted 25
vards into safe territory, After several
line bucks by Perr and Minter for the
Juniors and by Ives and Couch for the
Fresh, the ball, at the end of the quarter,
rested near the middle of the field.

The third quarter began hy Juniors
kicking off to the Fresh. After several
good gains by Crouch and Armstead, for -
the Fresh. the ball went over to the Jun-
iors. Fighting with a fresh impetus, the
Juniors steadily marehed to the Fresh
iievard line, where, by a beautifully, exe-
cuted, over-the line forward puis, Craw-
ford to Sparrow, they scored the only
touchdown of the pane. Minter kicked
goal,
