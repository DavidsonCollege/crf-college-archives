Practical and Stirring
Commenc’m’nt Sermons

Dr. Neal L. Anderson Preaches the
Baccalaureate Sermon. Y. M.
C. A. Sermon by Dr. W.

L. Lingle.

A collegiate and impressive scene pre-
sented itself shortly after 11 o'clock Sun-
day when only twenty members of the
large graduating class marched in cap
and gown into the front pews reserved
for them in the Presbyterian Church.
A large congregation had gathered to
hear the baccalaureate sermon by Dr.
Neal L. Anderson, of the class of '85.
recently President of Austin Theological
Seminary. In the pulpit also were Dr.
C. M. Richards and Rev. A. T. Gra-
ham, D.D., of Lexington, Va.

Dr. Anderson spoke very feelingly of
the absent members of the Senior class
and of the absence of so many students.
In this connection he spoke of the heavy
war clouds which are now lowering over
our country as we enter into the Great
War. It was peculiarly touching as he
faced less than half of the class—the
Jarger part having responded to other
calls and fields of service and action.

His text was Second Kings 6:17:
“And Elish prayed, and said, Lord, 1
pray thee, open his eves, that he may sec.
And the Lord opened the eyes of the
young man; and he saw: and, behold.
the mountain was full of horses and
chariots of fire round about Flisha,”

As a historical setting he spoke about
Dothan, a little village of Galilee, fam-
ous because of the incidents of the text.
From this Biblical picture he at once
drew an analogy to present-daiy affairs.
that of « world oppressed by the con-
suming war which threatens all the mag-
nificence of the grandeur which presaged
the Twentieth eCntury civilization.

Then with the vividly pictured, the
audience was reminded that God will
retort these horrors.

Couched in beautiful language, he pic-
tured the might and power of our Na-
tion. It is literally true that the watches
of the longest winter night can not veil
the light of day that is shining some-
where upon the territory that belongs to
this great country. Then from amidst
all this great peril and change he ap-
pealed to the class in showing them the
opportunities which lie before the edu-
cated man of vision.

Many and strong are the enemies of
civic peacefulness and righteousness. Al-
lied against truth and justice. brother-
hood and liberty are the hordes of forces
of materialism, graft. commercialism,
and the enshrined goddess of Getting-on.

When we see things in their true
perspective we will find a cure for these
maladies—the preventive and cure is a
vision of God and His power. In an-
other strong appeal he said let us be
fully confident that God, tho invisible,
is above and behind it all that His provi-
dence is reigning and that in this faith
there are three tenets which are irrefut-
able. First. God makes no comprosise
with sin. America’s sins—racial conceit
and prejudice, may be used as a chastise-
ment and not as a saving factor.

Second, God has a mission for us—to

bless mankind the world over with the/be brought up to abhor war.

Concert, Class Day Exercises, Junior Orations Contest and Award
of Medals and Distinctions.

CONCERT.

The annual Commencement Concert
was given by the Orchestra and Glee
Club last Monday afternoon at 3:30
p.m. Altho many of the members had
already left, yet the remainder rendered
a most delightful and entertaining pro-
gram. ‘Vhe quartet, composed of J. C.
Fowle, K. P. Coachman, E. P. Childs
and A. ‘T. Cashion, was perhaps enjoyed
the most, altho all the selections were
heartily applauded. ‘They gave several
selections of rag-time and popular songs
that pleased everyone. “The whole audi-
ence arose and remained standing while
the Orchestra played, as the final num-
ber, “America,” and ‘““Vhe Star-Spangled
Bariner.”

CLASS DAY EXERCISES.

The Class Day Exercises were held in
Shearer Hall, Monday evening at 5 p.
m. It had been planned to hold them on
the campus, but the high wind and the
dust were so disagreeable it was thought
best to hold them inside. Andrew Brown
delivered the sahutatory address, after
which R. C. Jenkins gave an account of
the history of the class of 1917 very: wit-
tily and briefly. W. H. Neal was to
have presented the class gift. a hundred
and ten foot steel flag pole, but an ac-
count of an unavoidable accident. the
pole was badly broken, and it was not
considered worth while to present it yet.
P. B. Price. the class poet, next spoke,
and was followed by R. H. Ratchford.
who gave the class oration, in which he
urged the class of ‘17 to go into the
world as men, and to do a man’s job.
D. 1. McKeithen, president or the Sen-
ior class, presented the class book to the
president of the Junior class, and made
a few prophecies as ta the honors the
boys of '17 would be given. L. H. Fike!
closed the program for the evening with
the valedictory address.
