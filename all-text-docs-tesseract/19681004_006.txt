When the Davidson football schedule for 1968
was announced last spring, a pronounced groan could

heard rising from the student body.
he The first Came was to be against Bucknell. Nobody

knew anything about Bucknell, except that we toppled

them adequately in basketball, but no one figure that
game as heing much to worry about. Furman was still
on the schedule to virtually assure at least one win.
Connecticut really posed no outstanding threat. Nor

id Wofford.
aid Even Richmond, The Citadel and VMI loomed as
possible wins, so it looked like a winning season was a
good possibility, especially with the sophomores com-
ing of age. That wasn’t the problem.

_” What puzzled most of the students (and everyone
else as far as that was concerned), was that Davidson
took two teams from its basketball schedule and put
them on its football schedule. The question which
echoed from Cornelius to Fails Church was “Why
Virginia and Vandy?”

o Now that the Bucknell holocaust and loss at the
battle of Richmond are in the past, the question lingers
on.
There were numerous reasons for the Bucknell
defeat . . . call them bad breaks at crucial moments or
call them mistakes . . . they are to be expected at the
outset of the season. ;

But at Richmond, no one is really sure what ha
‘pened. The {Wildcats played a fine ball game, actually
dominating play and intimidating the previously ex-
plosive Richmond offense. Davidson did everything it
should have done, except win.

Such occurrences do not serve to brighten the
hopes for the encounter with the other Southern Gen-
tlemen tomorrow in Charlottesville, and the prospects
for the final game against the Commodores from Van-
derbilt are anything but bright. ;

Not even Purdue could help the situation. Al-
though they had a shot at leveling the Cavalier spirit
at the initiation of UVa’s new season, not even the
44-13 trouncing that the Boilermakers gave them

dampened the spirit which has become a part of:

Cavalier football this year. This was evident last week-
end, when they took out their Purdue-earned revenge
on the Keydets of VMI, 47-0.

Now the Davidson camp is beginning to think
that it might have bitten off more than it can chew,
especially since the Cavaliers have announced inten-
tions of enjoying their homecoming. And tomorrow,
the 25,000 screaming Virginians that are expected to
fill Scott Stadium to capacity won’t make it any easier.

Kelly and Slade will be there, and Hannen will be
back in fourth gear and running strong. The defense
is aware of Virginia’s size and is anxious to prove its
worth. Everyone on the team side of the problem says
the team is as ready as it can be. But.is that ready
enough?

If Davidson survives the Virginia whipping post,
then it will have nearly two months to sit back and
contemplate the bigger boys from the Southeastern
Conference.

What about Vanderbilt? It will be tough, but for
the present let’s not think beyond Charlottesville and
tomorrow afternoon. We'll cross the Vanderbilt bridge
when we get to it. .

The only problem with Davidson football is that
it spends all of its time crossing those big bridges,
and it never seems to get anywhere.

One of Davidson's all-time
greats in football is back on
campus, but in a different
role.

Russell E. Walls, the new-
est addition to the Davidson
Psychology Department, was
a two-way gridder here from
1962 to 1964.

As a lineman on both the
defensive and offensive units,
Walls started in all three
seasons and served as a co-
captain his senior year.

Although relatively small
for his line position at 6-1,
195 pounds, he never missed
a game throughout his Da-
vidson career. "

Walls was at his best on
defense. As a champion high
school wrestler, he gained
the ability te move laterally
at an exceptional speed, and
he still remembers defensive
coach Thomas Stevens say-
ing, “lateral movement fs
the most important skill of a
defensive player.’’ Stevens is
now swimming and baseball
coach.

“I continued wrestling at
Davidson because I felt it
helped me in football,”
Walls said.

For his outstanding work

Walls Reealls Career
As Davidson Footballer

at Davidson, Walls was twice
selected to the Southern Con.
ference all-academic team,
and received both the George
M. King Award. given to the
football player who stars
both on:the gridiron and in
the classroom, and the, La.
Far Award, presented to the
finest Davidson defender.
Walls recalis the highlight
of his career. when he re-
ceived the Earl Blake

Award.

This honor, bestowed on
one gridder in each NCAA
district, is awarded on the
basis of outstanding football
skill, campus leadership, and
academic excellence. He is
the only Davidson student
ever to have won the award.

The honor carried: with it

The Wildcat star did not
depart without further hon-
or, either. He was contacted
by letter by the Minnesota
Vikings and another minor
professional football team.

He did not respond to eith.
er letter, however, still in-
tent on his graduate studies.

Stevens calls Walls “one of
the best’ football players !
have ever coached. He was
a coach's dream. He was a
fine competitor, as tough as
a defensive player could be.
and yet he was a real nice
guy off the field.”

IMAC Flickerball: -

By BILL. BERRY
Asst. Sports Editor

IMAC flickerball be gan
what should be a very excit-
ing season this week with a
full schedule of games. The
league has several teams of
nearly equal strength, and a
close finish like that of last
season should be the result.

The KA's struggled their
way to the championship last
year, but probably will not
repeat. KA was hurt severe-
ly by graduation losses, and
the only returning starters
are Nelson Abell in the line
and Romey Fisher at tail-
back.

If any team can be picked
as a favorite for the cham-
pionship, it is the Phi Delts.

The strength and experience —

of a large group of returnees
from last year and some out-
standing sophomores give
the Delts the edge.

The Delts will be given a
close battle for the cham-
pionship by the Kappa Sigs.
The Sigs start a strong core
of upperclassmen, and the
experience could be an ad-
vantage.

The Phi Gamms have had
strong teams in yers past,
and this season will probab-
ly prove no exception even
though the Gamms will rely
heavily on sophomores. Re-
turning starters for the
amms are Bob Apgar, Wil-
bur Davis, Gary Deanhardt
and Mike Bumgardner.

Another tea mvwith a
chance ,at the championship
is Sigma Chi. The Machis’

feature an experienced team
led by Pete Norton, Jerry
Kroll, Fox DeMoisey and
Jim Long. Promising sopho-
mores include Rick Weddle,
John Saunders, Herb Clegg
and Doug Haynes.

The Sigma Nus do not
have the overall strength to
win the championship, but
will be able to beat any team
in the league on a given day.
The Nus are a predominant-
ly upperclass team, and the
experience should be a big

advantage. Bruce Weidner,

The SAEs have a team
much like the Sigma Nus in
that they will beat some of
the stronger teams in the
league but will not win the
championship. Charles

performer at tailback, but he
will have largely inexperi-

A Prognostication

somewhere in the lower half
of the league, Mackq Reavis,
John Baker, Bud Couser and
Ken Crews are fine players,
but probably will not be able
to pull the team out of the
second division.

The ATOs are in the same
situation as the KAs. They
lost several key players by
graduation and will have to
rely on sophomores. Starters
from last season are Jim:
Cooley and Todd Hutton. The
outstanding sophomore pros-

pects are Brad Danielson
and Mark Baker.

The Pikas are a very
young team this year, almost
wholly sophomores and jun-
fors. Inexperienced players
must come through if they
are to improve on their rec-
ord of last season.

The Sig Eps have a chance
to rise higher in the stand-
ings if sophomores come
through. Craig Garner and
Gary Sigmon will start in
the backfield. Bill Youkey is
a promising sophomore.

The Pi Kapps will probab-
ly not fare very well due to
the overall strength of the
league, but they may pull a
few upsets. Returning start-
ers include Ben Martin, Jim
Smoak and Tom Graves.

The Independents remain
an unknown quantity until
the season starts. Their suc-
cess will depend on their or-
gaization.
