Feb. 22-23. The program features Uris’ best selling novel
Exodus, which concerns the Jewish resettlement of Pal-

“The nature of the issues in-

cure promise a very interesting
and possibly quite heated two-
days,” stated Joe Robinson,
chairman of this year’s pro-

Magazine Promises
To Revive Humor

The winter issue of Scripts ‘n

mor than any other issue of
the past two years, Charles
Cornwell, editor of the publica-
tion, stated this week. The is-
sue should be distributed by
the first week in the second se-
mester.

Cornwell attributes R. D.
Jackson with providing a new
slant of humor. This slant has
an approach much like that of
the catalog parody in last year's
fall issue. Jackson has been
made an associate editor.

Included in the issue will be
the two winners of the fresh-
man short story contest. Corn-
well stated that he was disap-
pointed both with the response
to the contest and with the
quality of the stories entered.

The staff plans to conduct a
“scientific experiment” this
spring to “ascertain what kind
of magazine the student body
wants.” Cornwell would not

Davidson’s newest dormitory will be nam-
ed Richardson Hall in recognition of the
Richardson family’s contributions to Da-
vidson, President D. Grier Martin announced
this week. A $425,000 “challenge grant” to
Davidson’s ten-year plan was made last
week by the Richardson Foundation.

Other contributions to Davidson from
members of the Richardson family have
included the Preyer Infirmary, major
grants in 1929 toward the construction of
Chambers Building, and a memorial schol-
arship fund which has been provided by
the family of the late Lunsford Richard-
son, Jr.

SCHOLARSHIPS

The athletic field and stadium were giv-
en as a memorial to Lunsford Richardson,
Sr. The Richardson Foundation has also
created the Richardson Foreign Student
Scholarship Program, which’ this year is
supporting 16 students from other coun
tries at Davidson

The foundation's latest gift is $425,000,
providing Davidson raises. $1,375,000 from
other sources by Dec. 21, 1964, to provide
a total fund of $1.8 million for six endowed
professorships

BUILD FACULTY

The grant will launch the second phase

gram. According to the aims of the pres-
ent ten-year plan as stated in 1957, “the
largest allocations in our ten-year plan

must be in the area of large-scale endow-
ment for the purpose of building and hold-
ing a distinguished faculty of able, dedi-
cated Christian scholars.”

President D. Grier Martin, in reporting
the Richardson grant, stated that “since
1957, $4,481,610 has been raised in plant
and endowment funds toward Davidson's
long-range $11.5 million goal, and _ this
splendid Richardson challenge grant

VICKS HEAD

The Richardson family has long been
associated with Davidson. Lunsford Rich-
ardson, Sr. graduated from Davidson in
1875. Lunsford Richardson began to man-
ufacture the “Croup & Pneumonia Cure”
which soon became famous as Vicks Vapo-
rub. Richardson's company has expanded
into a world-wide empire in remedies,
chemicals and allied products.

Richardson's two sons, H. Smith and the

late Lunsford, Jr., attended Davidson ia
the classes of '06 and ‘14. They both sery-
ed terms as president of the Vick Chemical
Co.

H. Smith is now president of the Rich-
ardson Foundation. He served as vice-pres-
ident of Davidson's Board of Trustees from
1933 to 1943, and was president of the
alumni association from 1929 to 1932. He
was awarded an honorary doctor of laws

Miss Mayhew said that there
has been an increasing tenden-

students to underline and oth-

mester. She said that this was
particularly true of books in
the Reserve Reading Room.

also very inconsiderate of oth-
