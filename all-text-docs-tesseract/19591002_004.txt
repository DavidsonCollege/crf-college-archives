Dam Work Started
At Cowan’s Ford Site |

BY DON STOWELL

Governor Luther B. Hodges setting off a dynamite
blast on the east bank of the Catawba River Monday aft-
ernoon marked the beginning of a neW era in the history
of the Catawba River valley.

Not a stone’s throw from
where the Governor stood is
the spot where on February 1,
1781, Colonel William Lee Da-
vidson was killed. His heart
was pierced by a small rifle
ball fired by British forces in
the battle for Cowan’s Ford.
Lord Cornwallis was not stop-
ped, but our thirty militiamen
delayed his advance long
enough to let General Daniel
Morgan get away to the Yad-
kin. When completed, the dam
will cover the identical place
where Colonel Davidson died.

Log cabins and block houses
were the only type buildings in
the area at that time, but by
the mid-1880’s, many of the big-
gest and most wealthy cotton
plantations in the country were
to be found in the Catawba val-
ley,

About a dozen plantation
mansions and over a hundred
farm houses dotted the region.
Besides. the land owners, over-
seers, house-keepers and from
4 to 5 hundred slaves lived in
the valley.

Many of the landowners were
trustees of Davidson College
and their sons\attended either
Davidson or the University of
North Carolina. Their daugh-
ters studied at Salem College
in Winston-Salem,  -

After the Civil War and the
decline of agriculture the area
took a severe economic set-
back. Most of the old planta-

tion .homes have since beep words of Governor Hodges,

torn down, burned or have fall-

standing, is believed to be the
only one to be inundated by
the lake water. ‘

A Duke Power Company rep-
resentative stated that the
number of people to be moved
aut of the lake area would be
“negligible,” because the com-
pany has owned most of the| |
land for thirty years.

Since the Cowan's Ford plant:
is the first the company has
built in some years, the num-
ber of workers to be employed
at the site is as yet unknown.! -
However, a “construction vil-
lage,” consisting of trailers and |
pre-fabricated houses is being ‘
planned. A mess hall is already | —
at the construction area.

In his address Governor| !
Hodges called the development {
“a great event in the life and |

economy of this vast Piedmont
region...” and stated that a

dro-electric potential.”

Six to ten access areas to
Lake Norman are being con-
templated for water sportsmen.
With its 33,000 acres of surface
area, extending into Mecklen- TIME
burg, Lincoln, Catawba and
Iredell Counties, the lake will
provide ideal conditions for
boating, fishing and other wa-
ter sports.

Joe mentioned several issues
as being “crucial” last year:
the Court of Control, vesper
overcrowding, and _ others.
Many were perennial topics of
campus debate: compulsory re-
ligion, lack of participation, the
Honor Code, and so forth.

In closing Mr. Smith remind-
ed the men of their influence
on the freshman halls, as they
were elected in the hall meet:

engravings’ of Hogarth: “Ho-
garth’s Works” which are bound
into, an elephant folio volume.

Professor Cumming began
telling of his Sabbatical year’s
leave and the Guggenheim fel-
_ lowship awarded him. The trip
was concerned with a search
for documents, chiefly maps,
concerning early explorations
along the east coast of North
America. »

An expert author on the
subject of maps, Professor
Cumming told of his approach
to the problem of finding new
material for study. “Many post
Columbus sua. sailed
along the east coast, I just at-
tempted to revere the direc-
tion of discovery, crossing the
Atlantic to| explore European
archives fdr “buried” docu-
ments about these eatly voy-
ages of discovery.” Professor
Cumming said that the British
Museum, the Library of Con-
gress, the University of Cali-
fornia, and other libraries have
asked for copies of photographs
of maps found during the
study.
