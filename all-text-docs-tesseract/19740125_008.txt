and RUSSELL CARTER

An expectant silence fell over the
capacity crowd in the Charlotte

from becoming a reality.
Suddenly the spotlight caught a small

onto the stage. He up his

and 1966, ‘‘Highway 61 Revisited’’ and
“Blonde on Blonde,” recordings that
some feel are superior to any pop music
before or since.

and deeply shaken by a near-fatal

Dylan but cannot be compared directly
to any previous work.

“‘Lay Lady Lay”’ is next, followed by
a perfect version of ‘Just Like Tom
Thumb’s Blues.” Then “It Ain’t Me
Babe”’ is done with a bit of country
flavor and harmonization by
Richard Manual and Nobbie Robertson.

“You don’t have to be a weatherman
to know which way the wind is

blowing”

“‘Nashville Skyline” was very much
in the country style, with Johnny Cash
accompanying Dylan in a new version
of an old song. This album spoke of
gentle, rewarding love, a theme that
was expressed most beautifully in
“‘New Morning’’ in 1970.

The mythical character who did all
those things is often referred to as ‘‘the
real Bob Dylan.’’ The more human Bob
Dylan decided long ago that he was
tired of being a prophet, but a myth on-
ce created is hard to dispell.

almost 20 million requests (at $8.50
apiece) for the 658,000 tickets to see

Dylan in 36 shows through 21 cities.

well-known song from a 1964 album, is
effectively changed from the original
acoustic form to rock.

This concludes Dylan’s first set and
the Band plays a brief set that begins
appropriatelyenough with ‘‘Stage
Fright.’’ In this song, Dylan’s reaction
to his last road tour, in late 1965 is
described: ‘‘See the man with the stage
fright standin’ up there givin it all his
might And he got caught in the
spotlight And when he gets tothe end
He wants to start all over again.”’

Led by the absolutely brilliant guitar
of Robbie Robertson, the group almost
causes everyone to forget who is
waiting to come back on stage.

Dylan rejoins the Band performing.

“‘All Along the Watchtower”’ featuring

Dylan then announces the in-
termission, ‘‘We’ll be right back,”’ in
his last spoken communication with the
audience.

After the break Dylan returns alone,
bearing his Martin guitar and har-
monica onthe neck brace. If there is in
fact a “‘real Bob Dylan,”’ this is he, and
the crowd loves it.

First is ‘‘The Times They Are A-
Changin’.”’ Dylan, who received a great
deal of criticism for “‘ the

cause,’’ now confirms that he still holds
to the principles he - once led so many

people to support.

The tour reveals what Dylan’s more
perceptive followers have always
known, that the old songs are still
alive, still available. If you don’t want
to listen to what Dylan has to say on
“‘New Morning,” then ‘Freewheelin ”
is as accessible as your record player.

“Don’t Think Twice, I’ts Allright” is
done softly, featuring the best har-
monica performance of the night, and
Dylan’s music drips with pain and con-

“Just Like A Woman’’ is done per-
fectly, with creative pacing of the wor-
ds in a differentt style from his past
renditions.

The solo set ends with “‘It’s Alright,
Ma (I'm Only Bleeding).” A great roar
is raised by the lines ‘“‘Goodness hides
behind its gates/But even the Presi-
dent of the —— enn
must have tos' ”

The acoustic set is the high point of
the concert. The songs are executed
perfectly setting an _ intensel
emotional tone. It is Dylan at his best,
communicating with his audience with
only vocals, guitar, and harmonica.

He has changed considerably sinee
his early fame, but he: can still
remember those times and is now

. Willing .to. play.the.role he, played then,

if only briefly.

The opening chords of ‘Like A Rolling
Stone”’ and the raising of the nouse
lights initiates a spiritual contest to see
how many people can pack themselves
into the area in front of the stage.

“How does it feel To be on your own
With no direction home A complete
unknown Like a rolling stone.”’

Everyone sings along as Dylan belts
out a fine performance of what must
be considered the best rock 'n’ roll
song of the 60’s. .

A thunderous ovation follows Dylan
and the Band off stage.

They return without the self-
indulgent long wait that most groups
seem to enjoy and repeat the opening
song, ‘‘Most Likely.’’ It is even better
than the first time. Robertson plays a
spectacular break and Dylan looks up
and smiles for the first time.

Then it is all over. Everyone is well
laid back by what is the best rock show
we have ever seen or heard anything
about. The power of the performance is
evidenced in the people who have never
had any serious exposure to Dylan but
are almost as moved as the old
fanatics.

_People look into each other’s faces,
silently _asking ‘Could you possibly
have enjoyed this as much as I did?”

Dylan is back on top of the rock
world. His commercial success presen-
tly is almost unbelievable. - This tour
will gross over $5 million and his new
album has already become his 14th gold
record for advance sales of over one
million dollars.

Judging from the concert per-
formance of songs from it, it may be
almost as good as his best.

Welcome back, Bob. I you
were never really too far away, but it
was sure good to see you tor real!
