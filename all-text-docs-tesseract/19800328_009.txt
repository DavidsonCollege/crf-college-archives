Baseball undefeated in Conference

By STOKES PEEBLES
Staff Writer
After sweeping a doublehead-
er from Appalachian State Sat-
urday afternoon, Davidson is in
first place in the Southern
Conference baseball standings

for the first time in several '

years. The Wildcats boast a 4-0
conference record along with an
overall mark of 8-6. The Cats
definitely have the potential of
having a winning season along
with remaining at the top of the
Conference standings.

_ Coach Palmer Muench lists
several reasons for the Wildcats
emergence as a conference pow-
er, ‘‘I attribute a lot of the early
season success to the year
round program,’’ he stated,
“but basically we are doing it
with defense which in turn
doesn’t put pressure on the
offense. We’re free to hit
without worrying about catch-
ing up.’

Coach Meunch is extremely
pleased with the way the three
freshmen pliyers, Phil Gordon,
John Marshall, and Bobby
Barnes, have come through.
Captain Cam Zurbruegg had
high praise for the freshmen.
He remarked, ‘‘John Marshall's
consistent hitting and Bobby
Barnes’ clutch hitting have
been strong additions to the
team’s talent.”’ But Zurbruegg
was quick to note that the
upperclassmen were still the
team’s leaders in hitting and
pitching. He cited: John Has-
kell’s hitting (leading the team
with a .358 average and 2
homeruns) and strong pitching
from Diggs Bishop (3-0) and
Jon Young (4-2) as en portent
factors as well.

The Cat’s power hitting and
pitching were evidenced in last
week’s games in which David-
son went 2-1. They started off
the week with a loss to West
Virginia State 9-7 but Zur-
bruegg had an outstanding day
at the plate by collecting three
hits. Allen Griffen belted a
home run and a double to add

offensive spark to the Wildcat
attack.

On Saturday against Appala-
chian State, Davidson had its

’ finest offensive game of the year

in the opener of a doubleheader
as App. State went down 9-3.

Phil Gordon blasted a grand .

slam home run and Allen Griffin

added a three run homer to seal’

the Wildcat victory. Jon Young
pitched an excellent game as he
went the full 9 innings to raise
his record to 4-2,

In the second contést Diggs
Bishop pitched an outstanding
game as he had a no-hitter until
the seventh inning. Bobby
Barnes knocked in the game’s
winning run.

As evidenced by these early
games, Davidson has been play-
ing excellent fundamental base-

ball by getting timely hits and .

having excellent pitching. The

. early conference victories haye

added morale as well as confi-
dence; something Davidson has
lacked in the past. Zurbruegg
commented, ‘‘We’ve begun past
years with conference defeats.
The fact that we’ve won four
straight shows we can play in
the Southern Conference.’’ If
Davidson can retain its confi-
dence as well as good hitting
and pitching, the Cats could
well remain at the top of the
standings throughout the year.
