THE DAVIDSONIAN, FEBRUARY 25, 1926

VOTING POSTPONED

The amendment to the constitution in-
cluding the proposed changes in the point
system, recommended tothe -student body |
last week by the student council, did not!
go before the student body for a final |
vote Monday morning as had been plan- |
ned. Action was deferred until Thurs- |
day morning because of the fact that |
the chapel services were being given ov- |
er entirely to Dr. Ogden, who was con-}
ducting the annual Y. M. C. A. Life Serv-
ice meetings. The proposed changes as
stated in the last issue of the Davidson-
ian will probably gain the approval of
the student body.

This business of drunken drivers and
automobiles is another one with quick

She—"Yes, IT managed to make a hole

Tf it is true that misery loves company
Davidson students should find comfort
in the fact that the same cry of “hard
work” is heard at Agnes Scqtt, as well as
at Davidson. Everywhere we are hear-
ing the cry for raised standards and
more rigid entrance requirements. No
one is satisfied. In the college papers
from all over the country questions are
arising as tothe object and the benefits
to be derived from a college education.
In the case of Agnes Scott, she is plead-
ing for more social life on the campus.
She partly attributes the lack of social
activities to too much work and a lack
of time. Whatever the cause, she real-
izes the disastrous result. The four
years of one’s college life comes when

fun is dearest: tothe heart, and when

social activities can be most thoroughly
enjoyed, and if these years are entirely
devoted to academic pursuits they be-
come a sahara in our life so far as pleas
ure is concerned. The most liberal
thinkers are crying for a compromise be-
tween work and play in which each will |
be given due consideration.

Two Professors to

Travel in Europe

While it is a little early to say anything
definite on the trips of the professors to Eu-
rope this summer, two of Davidson's best
loved and most popular professors have sig-
nified their intention of going over. They
have laid their plans, are now dreaming of
the sights they will see, and the educational
benefits of their tour and vacation this sum-
mer. The complete itinerary has not been

. made out, but they plan on visiting the most

historic and picturesque places that Europe
has to offer.

Dr. W. R. Grey, professor of Latin and
assistant professor of French, plans on leav-
ing about the first of May, and expects to be
gone during most of the summer. He ex-
pects to study modern languages at first hand,
as well as derive pleasure from his trip, The
trip made through the generosity of
friends, who have kindly furnished him with
the well-deserved and long-needed vacation,

Dr. C. M. Richards also expects to cross
the seas, but he plans on leaving a little later
than Dr. Grey.
at Oxford University in time to see his son,
McDowell Richards, graduate from that in-
stitution, Dr. Richards has for the past 17
years been pastor of the Davidson Presby-
terian Church, and
Bible. At their recent meeting the board of
trustees made him a full professor, and he
has had to resign his pastorate here, His
trip made through the generosity of
friends and the faculty, and comes as a well-
deserved reward for his 17 years’ service
here.

alternately between Johnson, Edwards, Wal-

Johnson will no doubt: play centerfield regu-
