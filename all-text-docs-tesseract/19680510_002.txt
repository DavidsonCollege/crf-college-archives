Re The Board: Defense...

It's not often that we come to the
defense of the Board of Trustees for
not doing something, but in one rather
touchy matter that came up last week,
we think they did the right thing.

The delay on the CRAP decision was
understandably not popular witha lot
of students and faculty members. The
report and the new philosophy and
rule changes it carries with it were a
long time in coming. and some feel it
shouldn't have to wait any longer.

They forget. however, that it took
a joint student-faculty committee
many weeks to come up with. accepta-
ble proposals. They forget that the

faculty spent two meetings thrashing.

it out. And they forget that the final
report was not presented to the trus-
tees until they reached campus.

Remember, too, that some of the
changes asked for are pretty drastic.
They were unusual enough to get un-
usually lengthly deliberation in the
faculty, and the trustees should get
equal time.

As for some of the other trustee
decisions, we are just as unhappy as
the next person. The so-called ROTC.
“compromise” is really no compromise
at all. What the faculty and board have
fallen back on is a former policy that
never did take the essence out ‘of
compulsory ROTC. And with or with-
out the new exemption, ROTC will re-
main required in both principle and
practice.

Ducking the student-faculty resolu-
tion warrants no praise either. Human
rights aren't a matter of local jurisdic-
tion, and the board would hardly be

“butting in” by supporting a call for
an end to segregation.

But we'll back the board on its de-
cision to mull over the CRAP Report
a bit. It'll come up again shortly when
the board holds its special meeting,
and, as Student Body President Joe
Murphy put it, we won’t be disappoint-
ed in what the trustees didn’t do last
week if they approve the changes next
time.

For something like the CRAP
changes. we are willing to wait—for
a few weeks.

..-And Praise

Last week’s trustee meeting includ-
ed one innovation that we'd like to see
become a regular item on the board’s
agenda.

The meet-the-trustees session on
Thursday night was a real success, as
any of the dozens of students and the
several trustees who were there will
tell you.

In fact, one trustee there, taking

note of the lively discussions going on |

around him, was moved to say that it
was the first time he-had had ‘the
chance to hear what was really on stu-
dents’ minds.

He heard plenty, too. And, perhaps
even better, the students could sound
out the trustees as well.

Could it be that the era of the seen-
but-not-heard student in trustee affairs
is coming to an end? We can only

hope.

N. G.’s Real Winner

If anyone emerged as a winner in
last week’s state gubernatorial pri-
mary, we think it was Dr. Reginald
Hawkins, the Charlotte Negro who
challenged the white Democratic lead-
ership.

Although he won only 18 per cent
of the electorate, Dr. Hawkins captur-
ed most of the Negro vote, and there-
by became the chief statewide black
leader. By marshalling North Caro-
lina’s Negro voters, he emerged as a
force to be reckoned with.

The “winners” won _ shallow’
victories. ‘Both Democrat Bob Scott

and Republican Jim Gardner face a
hard campaign. Neither is sure of suc-

cess. The Democrats, who have held’

the state house for generations, are
badly split, and Gardner must: con-
vince voters of his depth and ability,
not a small task in his case.

But in defeat Dr. Hawkins has cap-
tured certain victory. Serious white
candidates will have to make their
peace with him if they expect to win
in’ November. The Negro vote may
well tip the scales. In the bargains
which will be made this fall, Dr. Haw-
Kins can’t lose.

Helmets And Bayonets

This summer many American cities
will resemble armed camps.

The-helmet and bayonet, the khakis
and rifles and the soldiers marching
in the streets will become symbols on
television newscasts. There will be
scenes of urban violence that will re-
semble World War I newsreels.

Mobs will form, tempers will rise,’
and in the midst of shattering glass
and burning tenements the hot and
languid summer will witness Ameri-
ca’s racial conflict.

Magazines will have color pictures
of black men running with stolen cases
of beer and television sets. There will
be sniper fire from high above the
streets and teenage boys will be killed
on street corners by frightened Na-
tional Guardsmen.

The acrid stench of ghetto violence
will stifle some American cities this

Just how far Davidson is removed
from most university campuses is il-
lustrated by an affair currently in
progress at Stanford University.

A naked gir! is running for student
body president.

Mrs. Victoria Reich, known profes-
sionally as Vicki Drake, has a part-
time job as a San Francisco topless
performer. She is banking on a raft
of campaign posters, showing -her ap-
pearing nude, and topless appearances
in dormitories ta get her elected.

The nifty 38-22-33 blond claims
that nobody takes the student presi-
dency seriously. She says her lovely
young bod will change all that.

We can only suggest that if she gets
elected the name of the office be
changed to Student Body.

summer.

The causes of this violence are
bound up in 300 years of racial and
economic. pressure. Three hundred
years when the white majority effec-
tively squelched the black minority.

And now deeply disturbed blacks
are venting their hang-ups in a wave
of violence.

This violence, and especially vio-
lence of the current magnitude, is not
a predetermined outcome ordained by
history and generations now dead. It
is not inevitable that it should rend
the fabric of society in its force and
viciousness. The wild outbursts and
Savage repressions could have been
avoided.

Something can still be done.

White men must communicate with
black men. White men must show
black men that they really want to
obliterate the legacies of racial op-
pression.

It is a time to act and speak. To act
individually and in groups to achieve a
climate of equality of opportunity and
justice, to speak personally to achieve
a climate of thought and feeling where
racial harmony can be contemplated.

Americans must work to stop the
minor incidents and vast reprisals, the
purely destructive guerrilla burning
and purely destructive armed occupa-
tions and seizures. The political ‘decay
and mismanagement of inner city
problems must be checked. The over-
use and misuse of military power in
civil disorders must be stopped.

It is the responsibility of every white
American to communicate with his
black neighbors.

Or we shall face more summers of
pictures of attacking National Guards-
men and dead snipers in ruined build-
ings and the ghetto streets will once
again be drenched in fire and bolod.

To Compulsory ROTC’s Defense

To The Editor:

In my three years at Da-
vidson, I have read numer
ous editorials and letters to
the editor against the com-
pulsory ROTC program at
Davidson. I cannot remem-
ber. however. a letter or ed.
itorial in its defense. 1 be-
lieve there is another side to
the issue.

The conclusion of your edi-
torial ‘In Defense of Liber.
ty’’ was: ‘The defense of lib
erty will not suffer if ROTC
is placed on a voluntary
basis: the commitment of
this institution to providing
a liberal education will cer-
tainly be strengthened.’ 1
disagree with the use of the
word “‘certainly,”” for to use
it. one needs to be able to
prove his position. I believe
that, at best. it is a debat.

able point.
Your position was based
upon the idea “. . . that

ROTC has no place in the
liberal arts curriculum.” It
**. . . does not contribute to
the liberalization of the mind.
It does not produce more
humane attitudes in young
men. It does not broaden
their perspective. nor does it
prompt them to seek knowl-
edge purely for the sake fo
learning.”

“Liberalization of the
mind” is a nebulous concept.
It. incorporates the ideas of
broadmindedness, of toler
ance. Educators have long
argued what contributes in
the area and what detracts.
for it raises the old question
ef how one teaches an atti-
ude.

Seamans: Board
Ignored Its Duty

To The Editor:

If there is any particular
body connected with David-
son College whicir taxes its
“Christian commitment” se
riously, it is the Board of
Trustees.

Yet in its recent meeting,
this body decided against en-

dorsing a resolution support-,

ing the student body and the
faculty in their attempts to
bring Davidson closer to’the
ideal of a truly integrated
community.

-At the same time, the trus-
tees decided, in spirit if not

in letter, to continue .compul-
sory ROTC. They avoided en.
tirely the question of wheth.
er a -church-related college
should be in the business of
training soldiers.

And assorted chapel speak-
ers still continue to wonder
why the church is no longer
met by this generation with
either a fervent embrace or
a hostile rejection, but sim-
ply with yawning indiffer-
ence?

To be an educational institution, as opposed to

and viable alternatives and let the students decide for
themselves.

Davidson places the emphasis in the wrong places.
The church behind the college has said, “You must
not.” The church, through its child the college, should
say, “You should not,” and then give some damn good
reasons for saying so.

A footnote: In three years at Davidson, I cannot
remember a single chapel speaker that has presented
any sort of program on drinking and Christian life.
Maybe the church isn’t interested in that sort of thing
anyway.

...And Among Siblings

About open dorms, another part of the CRAP
Report.

At the student-trustee reception, one trustee said,
“I can’t see why students would want to entertain
women in their bedroom.” (Emphasis in the original)

What this trustee has failed to realize is that a
student's dorm room serves not only as his bedroom.
It is also his study, his music room and his living room.

Students have a right to receive female as well as
male guests in some sort of privacy. A dorm room is
the only place on this campus where a student may sit
down, talk and play his favorite records in privacy.

___ 1s Davidson such 3 communally oriented institu-
tion that it would deny its students this sort of privacy?

By emphasizing the “bedroom issue” of open
dorms, the trustee apparently had visions of fornicat-
ing students and worse. Such fears are largely un-
founded. Sexual promiscuity will be largely non-exist-

ent in a system of open dorms operated in a responsible
manner.

And Davidson students are mature and responsible
enough to make an open dorms system work.

Besides, opening dorms to women guests has a
secondary advantage. It’s an incentive to keep the
dorms clean.
