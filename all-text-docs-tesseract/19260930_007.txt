In connection with the many other im-

been granted to use the room directly across
the hall from the present “Y” room for a
similar purpose and work will soon be started
to fix it up like the other room, The pres-
ent reading room has become so popular that
the need is felt for more room and this
seemed to be the most profitabie . solution.
