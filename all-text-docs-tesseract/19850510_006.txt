Daidson Baseball Team

Cats

By EDWIN PAGE

The Davidson College
Baseball team travels to Warren
Wilson this Saturday to put the
cap on what has been a superlative
season. With only one game to go,
Davidson’s 24-19 record assures
the Cats of a winning season, the
first such campaign since 1975
and only the fifth since 1954. The
Wildcats’ Southern Division
Championship is the first of any
kind that the baseball team has
ever garnered.

Davidson Coach George
Greer cites several reasons for the
team’s turnaround from last year’s
12-16-1 team. “We played much
better defense this year as well as
improving our scoring. Despite
ranking only fifth in the SC in
team batting averages, Davidson
leads in runs per game with 8.58.
As maligned as our pitching staff
was, I think we made a lot of prog-
ress in that area. Sophomore Steve
Condon pitched very well at the
end of the season, and sophomore
Billy Waitsman came on strong
after a slow start. Freshman David
Fitzgerald had a big part in our

successes and junior Scott Weaver
was steady for us all year.”
Weaver currently has 94 strike-
outs for the season and is the

team’s leading winner with a 6-4
record. Coach Greer also cited the
contributions of freshmen pitchers
Charlie Winborne and Darryl
Bego.

. The improvement of the
Wildcats is also obvious from the
individual achievements of the
players. Junior Keith Helfant led
last year’s squad with a .352 aver-
age. This year he is hitting .350
and is fourth on the team behind
freshmen Bill Masse (.430) and
Alan Lewis (.364) and sophomore
David Turgeon (.378). Helfant,
Turgeon, and Masse were all
named to the all-conference team.
Lewis was bypassed for this honor
despite leading the conference in
RBIs and doubles. Masse was
named freshman of the year, and
viewing his credentials it is easy to
see why. He leads the conference
in batting averages and runs
scored, is second in stolen bases,
third in RBIs and doubles and fifth
in triples. Masse hit his tenth
homerun of the season Tuesday
tying the school record. The man
in second in RBI’s between Lewis
and Masse is Turgeon. To top off
the individual awards, Greer was
selected Southern Conference
Coach of the Year early this week.

Even after posting their finest

record in a decade, Coach Greer
sees improvement ahead. With
Fitzgerald, Winborne, and Bego
carrying an important load this
year, the Cats were relying heav-
ily on freshmen on the hill, and as
Coach Greer said, “ail freshmen
will have their ups and downs.”
With the maturing of this year’s
crop and the infusion of six new
arms next year, the Cats will have
their deepest pitching staff since
Greer’s arrival.

With nary a senior on the ros-
ter, the offense should be back in
force; but Greer is looking for im-
provement here as well. “I'd like
to see our two captains [juniors
Weaver and Tim Waters] hit for
higher averages and Alan Lewis
have a steady year.” Despite
Lewis's fine statistics, he tailed
off toward the end of the season
after a blazing first half.

Coach Greer concludes: “This
was a very successful year in
terms of wins and losses and in
other areas. We got very impor-
tant contributions from our
freshmen, and the fans really
started coming out when we got
into the pennant race. The future
for Davidson baseball is brighter
than it’s been in a long time.”

Men’s Tennis Team Finishes Third In Tournament

By JOE JOHNSON

The Men's Tennis team closed

out its 1985 campaign — last
weekend with a third-place finish
in the Southern Conference

Championships, held this year in

Greenville, SC. Tennessee-Chat-
tanooga won for the eighth
straight year with 68 points.
home-standing Furman finished
second with 6! points, and the
Cats followed with SO.

Coach Jeff Frank was pleased
with the team’s overall] play, not-

ing that Davidson won five of six
first-round singles matches and
two of three first-round doubles
matches. Especially encouraging
with regard to next year’s outlook
were the performances of the three
freshmen: Jim Thompson, Bill
Young, and Rick Hodge.

Equestrian Team Ends Season

By JANICE EVANS

After a quick string of succes-
ses in the fall and an uneventful
winter, the club equestrian team
ended its season with a number of
impressive appearances at reg-
ional and national competitions.

On April 20-21, Coach Nancy
Hoffman took a three-member
team to the National Intercol-
legiate Eventing Championships
in Pinehurst, NC, sponsored by
the Affiliated National Riding
Commission This competition
was radically different from the
shows of the Intercollegiate Horse
Show Association (the NCAA of
riding), in which the team com-
petes throughout the season. For
IHSA shows, a rider randomly
draws a horse of the host barn and
rides an animal with which she is
totally unfamiliar; she is then
judged on her position and control
of the horse For this show, the
team took horses from the Lake
Campus stables and competed in
three phases of competition: a

memorized program ride, a cross

country course, and stadium
jumping. Junior Julie Waters,
freshman Sian Hunter, and

freshman Kim Gambal attended
the show. Davidson finished sixth
in the stadium jumping phase and
tenth overall.

In addition, as the regular
IHSA season concluded, David-
son had its second rider in two
years qualify for the regional and
national horse shows. Waters,
with 23 points in Novice Equita-
tion on the Flat, and 22 points in
Novice Equiation over Fences,
qualified to compete in both divi-
sions. She won regional champion
in Division IV, her over fences
class, and earned the right to rep-
resent Davidson at the [HSA na-
tionals in Lexington, Kentucky,
on May 4. At nationals, she
finished second in her class,
bringing home the title of reserve
champion.

“Nancy’s coaching was unbe-
lievable; she watched each horse
and knew exactly how I'd have to
ride each one,” Waters com-

mented. “The training and coach-
ing came together at the right
time. I was very pleased with the
outcome.”

In addition to Waters, Hunter
rode at the regional show as well.
Her resume of past riding experi-
ences and successes was one of
four accepted for competition in
the regional jumper champion-
ships. She finished fourth in the
class in her first year of THSA
competition; there's a strong pos-
sibility she will have continued
chances in her next three years at
Davidson since the region’s other
schools’ top riders are mostly
juniors and seniors.

With another season behind it,
the club will continue efforts to
make itself an integral part of the
club sports program and an active
competitor in Region IX of the
IHSA. Losing only four seniors,
the team hopes to keep up its
string of successes of the past two
years, sending more individual
riders to the regional and national
shows and winning more shows as
a team.

Thompson, seeded first among
the conference’s number three
singles players, was upset in the
semi-finals by Bo Crouch of The
Citadel. The reason he was upset
was. of course, that the unseeded
Crouch defeated him 7-5, 7-6 on
the fast courts of Furman. Hodge,
seeded fourth in fifth flight singles
(say it ten times, fast), held double
match point in a semi-final war
against top seed and eventual
champion Bryan Kelley of Fur-
man before falling by the ex-
cruciating score of 1-6, 6-1, 5-7.
Young, the hero of the weekend,
roared through the fourth flight, in
which he was seeded only third,

without losing a __ single
set .. . and there was much re-
joicing.

Meanwhile, back at the first
flight, senior Sedge Gray turned
in another sterling martin perfor-
mance. Seeded third, Gray de-
feated second seed Steve Price of
Furman in straight sets even
though he suffered from botulism.
His second-place finish behind
UTC’s Conference Champion Or-
lando Lourenco contributed seven
points to the Just and Righteous
Cause of the Wildcats.

Senior John Hackett lived up
to his third seeding in sixth flight
singles with a 7-6, 7-5 victory
over ETSU’s Tom Hall.

Gray and Hodge finished
fourth in first flight doubles, fal-
ling to eventual champions
Lourenco and Waern of UTC and
a surprisingly tough Grattan and
Kelley of WCU. Thompson and
sophomore Michael Meyer,

seeded second in third flight dou-
bles, also finished fourth but
played quite well considering
Meyer had partaken of the same
doughnuts as had Gray and sub-
sequently was sick as a dog.

Other tournament stuff: UTC
coach Tommy Bartlett surprised
no one in winning Coach of the
Year, and Davidson’s own Jim
Thompson won the 1985
Sportmanship Award. Unfortu-
nately, he found the trophy that
was awarded a bit small and
reacted by swearing profusely and
smashing it to the ground. The
pieces are, however, very shiny
and can be viewed in the trophy
case at the Stowe Tennis House,
as far as you know. [Editor’s note:
Mr. Johnson is occasionally given
to lying like a corporate lawyer in
the course of his reporting, and the
gentle reader is advised not to
forget the traditional grain of salt. |
Sophomore Shel Robinson, who
had actually predicted
Thompson’s winning the award,
commented that ‘Jim is indeed a
great sport, and I strongly feel that
he should brush his teeth before
every match with a good fluoride
toothpaste.”

Next year looks very much
like 1985-86. Though Gray and
Hackett will be gone, their mem-
ory will live on and JY A baseliner
Craig “Grandpa” Hall and red-
shirted freshman Gallo Cabrales
are expected to step into the top
six, assuming they first wipe off
their feet.

That'll just about do it, then,
for 1985.
