This Week in Washington
Vatican Concert Honors Holocaust Victims

By Brett Marston

April 7th is the day on which
Jews remember Shoah.

On this April 7th, with a cer-
emony and concert in the Vatican,
the Roman Catholic Church offi-
cially honored the memory of the
victims of this catastrophe for the
first time.

The Chief Rabbi of Rome, Elio
Toaft, was invited as the honored
guest for the ceremony. He and
Pope John Paul II, along with the
President of Italy, Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro, sat together and listened
while the London Royal Philhar-
monic Orchestra played pieces by
Brach and Schubert. The orchestra
also. accompanied Richard
Dreyfuss as he read the Kaddish to
the music of Leonard Bernstein

After the concert, according
to the New York Times, Rabbi
Toaff said that the concert “as-
sumes a significance that goes be-
yond that of asimple artistic event.”

To put this into perspective:

Only in the past thirty years,
after the ground-breaking Second
Vatican Council in 1962 to 1965,
has the Catholic Church stopped

officially teaching that Jews, in
addition to being collectively re-
sponsible for the death of Jesus,
have suffered throughout history
because they rejected the “truth of
Christ.”

Further, it was only this past
January that the Vatican decided
to formally recognize the state of
Israel. In an interview in a recent
issue of Parade magazine (quoted
in the New York Times from April
3rd), Pope John Paul II echoed
earlier statements by saying that
the Jewish people had a right “to

_feturn to the land of their ances-

tors.”

This concert, organized by the
Gilbert Levine, an American, Jew,
and friend of the Pope, comes at an
important time. Antisemtism and
right-wing extremism are gaining
ground: in Italy, where an alliance
of parties on the far right won
significant victories in recent elec-
tions; in Russia, where the openly
antisemitic Zhirinovsky spouts
venom to large crowds; and in
Germany, where theRepublikaner,
lead by the former Waffen-SS of-

ficer Franz Schonhuber, might re-

ceive enough support in upcom-
ing elections to win seats in par-
liament—to name only a few
examples.

The Pope should be ap-
plauded for his efforts to keep
the Vatican on the course to-
wards improving Jewish-Catho-
lic relations at this crucial mo-
ment, almost fifty years after the
military defeat of the National
Socialists, and a few years shy
of the end of this most horrible
century in human history.

Roughly 100 Holocaustsur-
vivors attended the concert on
April 7th. Erwin Herling, who
survived Auschwitz and
Matthausen, told reporters,
“when the Pope shook my hand,
I had the feeling 2,000 years of
Jewish suffering had come to
some kind of turning point.”

The Dean Rusk Program

Who is Vladimir Zhirinovsky?

By Eric Collings

He recently told thousands of
cheering supporters that he plans
to unseat the Moscow government
and help the Serbs resist the West.
He envisions a new Russian em-
pire and a redrawn map of Europe
which would eliminate Austria, the
Czech Republic, and the Baltic
nations of Lithuania, Latvia, and
Estonia. He claimed, in a meeting
with former president Richard
Nixon, that Russia must defend
itself against the 300 million Mus-
lims massed on its southern border
that, are prepared to overrun the
country. He foresees the return of
Alaska into Russian hands, and he
according to his book The
Last March to the South , the “sal-
vation of the nation” through war
and conquest.

Is he certifiably insane, this
Opportunist seizing upon popular
displeasure with the Yeltsin
government's shaky transition
from a command ‘to a market
economy? Is he the “Russian
Hitler,” a fount of fascist, anti-
Semitic and imperialist views? Or
is he an immense fraud, a puppet
bankrolled by Yeltsin’s enemies,
tormer members of the KGB who
seek to divide the new democrats
in hopes of a reversion to Soviet-

era politics? In any case, Vladimir
Volfovich Zhirinovsky burst upon

the Russian political scene in early

December; coritinues to surprise
observers with his popular appeal,
and appears likely to challenge
Yeltsin for the Russian presidency
in 1996.

During last week’s party con-
ference, the ultra-nationalist Lib-
eral Democratic Party (LDP),
which is neither liberal nor demo-
cratic, declared Zhirinovsky its
“absolute leader” for the next ten
years, completing his ascent to the
top of Russian politics. -In 1991,
Zhirinovsky garnered six million
votes to place third in the presiden-
tial race won by Yeltsin. In last
December's parliamentary elec-
tions, the LDP stunned its oppo-
nents, who derided Zhirinovsky as
a clown, by receiving 12 million
votes (23.5%) more than any other
party, including the pro-Yeltsin,
pro-reform Russia’s Choice (15%)
and the Communists (12%). Asa
result of the party’s mandate,
Zhirinovsky now has “sole power
to appoint party officials at the
national and regional levels and to
decide all other matters of impor-
tance between [party] conferences
held every three years.” He will
also be automatically nominated

for Russia’s presidency in the next
election.

Zhirinovsky’s rapid ascent,
however, has alienated many al-
lies as well as opponents. The
former Prosecutor General Alexei
Kazannik initiated an investiga-
tion into Zhirinovsky’s extremist
speech and accused him of war-
mongering. Furthermore, two of
the top leaders of the LDP quit,
citing “ideological differences”
with the power-hungry
Zhirinovsky. Viktor Kobelev and

_ Alexander Pronin blasted their

leader's “extremism, interference
in the external affairs of some coun-
tries, and irresponsible statements
unauthorized by the party.” Per-
haps the most damaging revela-
tion, though, is the recent discov-
ery of public records in Alma-Ata,
Kazakhstan, Zhirinovsky’s birth-
place, which confirm a long-held
suspicion: Zhirinovsky, who cam-
paigns on intense anti-Semitism,

“But the government of Singapore (along with Malaysia and Trinidad
and Tobago) stands aloof from the universal condemnation. Singapore’
dictator is actually proud of his country’s reputation for keeping order
by inflicting pain. Moreover, his diplomat in the U.S. report that many
Americans endorse the lashing to be meted out to the young offender.
“That some people here thoughtlessly espouse torture is undeni-
able. One sap on the street in Washington told the reporter Karen De}
Witt of The New York Times: ‘If you’ve ever had your antenna ripped
of your car, you can sympathize with the Government of Singapore.
Lash him. Vandalism is a cowardly and insubordinate act.’
~“T’ve had more than a few antennas ripped of my car, and a few
swastikas sprayed on my house, and felt a surge of mindless fury at the

right to inflict physical pain on another human’being. If anything in

Here’s how to write recommendations for lousy job candidates.

: Excerpts from “The Lexicon of Intentionally Ambiguous Rec-
ommendations” (LIAR) by Lehigh University Economist Robert

Thornton whiz aroud the Internet. For a candidate with interpersonal

problems, he suggests saying: “I am pleased to say this person is a

former colleague of mine.” For the lazy worker: “In ny, opinion, you

will be fortunate to get this person to work for you.”

The book, published by Meadowlard Press in Deep Haven,
Minn., also suggests recommendations for the criminal: “He’s a man

of many convictions” and “I’m sorry we let her get away.” For the
untrustworthy candidate: “Her true ability is deceiving.” And for the
inept worker: “I most enthusiastically recommend this person with no

had a Jewish last name, Eidelshtein,
until age 18. Zhirinovsky and his
spokesman brand the documents
as forgery perpetrated by Russian
security agents, but questions re-
main unanswered,

Nevertheless, Zhirinovsky
survives and continues to frustrate
the Yeltsin government. In an hour-
long speech to conclude the party
confetence, he promised that he
would win the Russian presidency
by 1996 “at the latest” and restore
to Great Russia “fair borders” and
“decent life” for its citizens. As he
spoke, the LDP emblem waved in

the background: a black eagle
grasping a map of an expanded
Russia, complete with Alaska and
parts of Finland and Poland...

While President Yeltsin
struggles to assert his leadership
and control, some American con-
gressmen question our ties to Rus-
sia and call for a reduction in for-
eign aid because of incidents such
as the Ames spy case. Perhaps
they should instead be asking them-
selves, “Who is Vladimir
Zhirinovsky?”
