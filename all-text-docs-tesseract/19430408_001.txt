Second Group of Air

Corps Cadets Arrive
At Davidson Monday

New Group Must Undergo Up-
per, Under-Class “Rat”
Training Period

OCCUPY WEST DORM

Davidson Unit to Receive
Training at Cannon Field

The second contingent of the
Air Corps Pre-flight Cadets
arrived on the Davidson-Camp-
us last Monday.

Although Army® censorship pro-
hibits a statement of the exact size
of the unit, the number swells con-
siderably the already crowded cadet
population of the campus.

West Dormitory, hitherto evacu-
ated by Davidson students, has been
set up as a permanent barracks
for the new detachment. The same
rooming system has been installed
here as in East, with four cadets
sharing each room.

Rat System

A similar disciplinary and aca-
demic regime will be in effect with
the new cadets as with the old, with
the exception of a newly installed
“rat system” under which the new-
comers will undergo a two weeks
quarintine. This detention period,
aside from its disciplinary purposes,
is designed to protect the health of
the Gadets themselves and the health
of those with whom they may come
in contact.

These new enlisted men, classed as
air crew students, are also under
the command of Major J. L. Bonner,
who with his staff, is making his
headquarters in Davidson.

Cannon Field

Primary training in actual flight
work has already begun, and the
first members to undertake prepara-
tion for combat duty have received
instruction at Charlotte's Cannon
Fieid. The: flight instruction staff
there has increased considerably,
and it is expected that training ac-
tivity will be in full swing soon.

Major Bonner has indicated that,
although classed now as air crew
students, the cadets will be desig-
nated through later processing, for
subsequent training as pilots, navi-
gators, and bombardiers, according
to their individual abilities.

ODK MEETS

It was announced Monday by
Burkhead Walker, president of
ODK, that its annual spring tap
day would take place in the near
future. The date is as yet un-
decided but he said that he wish-
ed to bring the event once again
oefor the eyes of the student

body. a
The questionaires covering
campus related topics which

were filled in by students in the
fall were given careful consider-
ation.

Colonel Steel
Gets Letter
To Wife Here

Former ROTC Instructor, Now
Captive, Sends Message
From Formosa
Mrs. Charles L. Steel, of David-
son, received on Monday a direct
message from her husband, Col. C.
L. Steel, former instructor in the
Davidson R.O.T.C., now a captive
of the Japanese in Taiwan,

Formosa Island.

For long months after the fall of
Bataan, Mrs. Steel heard nothing
from her husband and had no way
of knowing what fate had befallen
him. Col. Charles L. Steel, who
had left his post at Davidson Col-
lege as assistant professor of mili-
tary science and tactics in 1940 for
active service with the U. S: Army,
had gained national fame as com-
mander of Bataan’s fighting 31st
Infantry. A few days before Christ-
mas, his wife was notified by the
War Department that he was a
prisoner of war on the island of
Formosa.

on

Chief of Staff

Just prior to the fall of *Bataan,
Col. Steel had been made chief of
Staff of the 2nd Philippine Army,
after he and his men had been
recognized for their courageous
battle against superior enemy forces.
On March 16, of this year, the War
Department announced the award
of the Legion of Honor to Col. Steel
for his distinguished service in the
Philippine campaign from December
8 1941 to March 17, 1942. “His
effective leadership was reflected in
TWO
the high morale and combat. effi-
ciency of his regiment,” the War
Department said.

The telegram received by Mrs.
Steel Monday was dispatched from
Sioux Falls, S. Dakota, where the
message had been picked up on a
short wave radio by an amateur
operator.

Message

The message read as follows: “I
am well, safe, and happy. Do not
worry about me. Will write soon,
and it) may sometime be
fore you get this letter. Please
send me monthly: chocolate bars,
peanut brittle, hard candy;~cheese,
hard bread or crackers, soluble cof-
fee, fruit cake, and jam. All packed

be

in tin.

“Take care of yourself. For me
the separation from you is the
hardest thing of all. Watch our

children and regards to our friends.
Please write and radio if you can.
All my love. Answer soon. (Signed)

L. Steel.”
