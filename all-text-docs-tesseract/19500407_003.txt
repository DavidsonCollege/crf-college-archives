Sec'y of Labor Tobin! OUT OF THE CRO

Gives Job Outlook
For 1950 Seniors

With about 500,000 college stu.
dents graduating this year — the
largest number in our country’s
history — the job outlook for the
new college graduates is generally
good. It is not, however as good
factors: the large number of grad-
uates who will be seeking jobs;
as in 1947 and 1948.

The outlook is clouded by three
moderate increases in the total
number of unemployed _ persons;
and the filling of war-created short-
ages of college graduates in some
specialized fields by the large grad-
wating classes of 1948 and 1949.

Basically, the economy of the
country is strong and there is a
general concensus that production
and employment will remain high

a year. Even if employment con-
tinues during 1950 at about the
same level as last year, as it is
expected to do, unemployment will
increase and jobs will be harder to
find.

Graduates seeking information on
expanding industries or sections of
the country need to remember this
basic fact: most of the jobs taken
by this year’s college graduates
will be, as usual, those which have
been vacated by other workers.
Deaths and retirements at the top
of the occupational. ladder create
the largest number of openings at
the bottom. It follows that mos:
of the openings will occur in the
large industries and the areas
where there are now the heaviest
concentrations of employment.

To emphasize that most job op-
portunities occur as a result of
turnover is not to belittle the num-
ber that arise through expansion.
Growing markets, technological
improvements, and the develop-
ment of new industries and addi-
tional services all create job open.

MAKE HILARIOUS 1914 HIT

On April Fool’s Day of 1914, the
Davidsonian made its debut to an
eagerly awaiting student body.
There had been many months of
planning, name selecting, ad solicit-
ing, and all the other labors of
creating a great newspaper. Among
the names submitted were “The
Davidson Tornet,” “Life,”’ “Echo,”
“Hummer,” “Spirit.” “Election,”
and “Haka-Rana.” The faculty had
submitted “Transcript” and “Blue
Stocking.”

This primigenial newspaper was
filled with the latest news of‘ the
day. D. C. President Martin had
just visited President Wilson of
D. C. to talk over the “good ol’
days” in the Presbyterian strong-
hold. The Davidson nine had down-
ed Catawba 8 to 1, and the debate
team was trying to decide whethor
or not the “United States should
maintain a position as one of the
fhree leading nations of the world.”.
Monsieur Morrison's Select Trio
of Musicians had just furnished
music for a stag dance presented by
the German Club, at which “the
Tango and afl the latest dances
were permitted.”

This issue might have been an
April Fool's edition, but there was
no attempt at pulling any- smiles
from its pious readers. Perhaps. a
few of the advertisements managed
to provide a little entertainment: R.
D. Mooney suggested that the read-
er “Buy Hardware from the Hard-
ware Store,” and then slyly added,
“There’s a reason.” He failed to
give any reasons in his ad, but
we'll take his word for it. Goodrum
and Co. was offering International
Harvester machines to the students
and boasting the highest prices for

a
n;

cotton, while Brown-Knox Mer
cantile Company was flying a “full
line of B.V.D.’s”

Five weeks later the Davidsonian
printed its first “joke.”

An old Scottish gentleman who
was a great enthusiast on the golf
links, and a young man who was
equally enthusiastic about the
game, had spent the entire day in
the field ... As they left for home,
the old Scotchman remarked:

“Hey, Mon, but it’s been a gran’
day!”

“It has,” asserted the young man.

“Think ye could come again on
the morrow, laddie?”

“Well,” answered the young man
reflectively, “I was to be married,
but T can put it off.”

That one must not have gone ov-
er so hot because it was not until
the following fall that another at-

time the editors went '“hog-wild”
about thé idea and presented four
side-rippers — the most hilarious
being—
Student — (in a burst of admira-
tion) — Professor Gabby is a
wonder as a linguist. What tongue
hasn't he mastered?
Asst. Prof. ——- (dryly) — His
wife's.
Thirty issues later some “dic-
hard” on the staff was still deter.
mined to get a laugh, so another
witticism was tried,
Fresh. — Doctor, did. they have
automobiles in the days of Xeno-
phon? .
Prof. —- Well, (probably stroking
his goatee) I hardly think so, why
did you ask?
Fresh. — Well my book states

YMCA cabinet. It was given al

place because cabinet members at
that time felt that the student body
should be familiarized with the
different social problems of the day.

The Social Action department
has dealt almost exclusively with
the race problem, which is prob.
ably the most pressing problem this
semester. Dr. Batchelor and Rev.
Bottoms were speak¢rs in Chapel
who gave us both sides of the ques-
tion.

The Intercollegiate Council is
the only active organization work-
ing under the direction of this de-

partment at the present time. It is A
a group which meets together ap.|-

proximately once every five weeks
with students from two Negro col-
leges to hear speakers and have
discussions on various problems of
concern to both races. There is no
membership in this council. All
who are interested in getting to-
gether for such a discussion are in-
vited.

The last meeting was held at
Barber Scotia College in Concord
on March 18th. Chick Longneck-
er gave a talk on African missions
and presented some pictures of
Africa. The next meeting, which
will be the last for this year, will
be held on the Davidson Campus
around the first of May. The exact
date, meeting place, and speaker
will be announced as soon as they

Church Being Razed To Make Way For New One

OLD CHUROH SITE
MAKES WAY FOR NEW

The red-brick building which has
housed worshippers for more than
fifty years is falling under the
hands of demolition workmen. The
tearing down of the old church
building is the first step in clear-
ing the grounds in preparation for
construction of the long-awaited
new place of worship. There are
now only a few workmen on the
job, but the main construction crew
will begin work as soon as the
building steel is delivered.

CODILE’S MOUTH North Carolina May|_

Lose Congressional
Seats After Census

North Carolina will probably
lose a, seat in the U. S. Hottse o1
Representatives , after the results
of the 1950 Census, are known —
that is, if Census Burean estimates
of the State’s population are rea-
sonably accurate.

JE. Dowd, chairman of the
Chamber of Commerce Census
Committee, explained today’ that
this was one of the reasons his
Committee is exerting every effort
to see that no one in Mecklenburg
County goes uncounted in the Gen.
sus now underway. li is possible
Mr. Dowd said, that Census Bu-
reau estimates are low for the
State, and if we get a complete
count we may be able to hold our
cleven seats in the Hotise of Rep
rescntatives.

Although North Carolina's popu-
lation has increased since 1940, the
Census Bureau doesn’t think it has
increased enough. to keep it from
losing a seat to one of the West-

ern states, such as California,
which lias shown — tremendous
growth.

The primary purpose of the 17th
Decennial Census of the United
States to be conducted in April
1950, Mr. Dowd said, is to deter-
mine the population of cach state
which is the basis for the division
of the 435 seats in the House of
Representatives. This is in accord:
ance with Article 1; Section 2, of
the Constitution. This section pro-
vides that representation in the
Hoise “shall. be apportioned among
the several states . . . according
to their respective numbers” to be
determined by an cnumeration of
the - population.

The Constitution provides that
each State shall have at least one
