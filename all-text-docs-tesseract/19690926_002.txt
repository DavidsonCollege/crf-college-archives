A Pretace

For the sake of clarification and
perhaps for the interest of the new-
comers to THE DAVIDSONIAN read-
ership, it seems worthwhile to re-state
a few basic foundations on which
this editorship bases its policy.

This summer's. resignation of half
of the. editorial “we has left a gap,
and it will produce a few changes in
procedure and attitude which such
departures necessitate. But it will

A New Look
For The Board

Although it is unlikely that he will
win the race he’s running, Tom Earn-
hardt has made a significant step to-
ward the placement of a recent stu-
dent on the Board of Trustees.

Only alumni were aware of the
advance, because it came in the form
of a ballot for the voting in the alum-
ni trustee election, but it is worthy
of all students’ notice.

If elected, Earnhardt will be the
youngest trustee on the board. But
more than that, his election would

lace in office a voice which has
ong served the interest of the David-
son students.

He is a person of ideas, and his
interest in Davidson did not cease
when he graduated in, 1968. As Stu-
dent Body President he paved the

.- way for significant advances in voic-
ing student feeling.

Many alumni ‘will regard his age
in a negative perspective, and such
a~-perspective does injury both to
Earnhardt and the college. A hard
worker with a wealthy resource of
ideas. and imagination, he would
serve Davidson well.

New Dorms,

On return (from a summer's
vacation, most students find them-
selves hung with the “How was your
summer?” mode of conversation
When they greet classmates or fra-
ternity brothers. It usually grows old
after the first hour.

This year, for the first time since
1906, the students found the dormi-
tories a fitting substitute for that
nitial conversation; at least, for the
‘irst time the tone was one of amaze-
nent rather than depression.

The college is to be commended for
these welcome changes, and along
with those congratulations go similar
greetings to the Residence Hall
Council, which spent most of last
year lobbying’ for such changes.

When the Board of Trustees ap-
proved some $200,000 for dormitory
and church renovation last spring,
few people envisioned the broad
changes which the aged structures
were to undergo.

The new atmosphere of Davidson

DAVIDSONIAN has begun in recent
years,

A realization of its own irrele-
vance “has led the paper in recent

ches to college news. {t has led to

out newspaper, one which serves
neither the school nor its students,
anymore than anyone else. We

news voice for Davidson College.

This is not a new idea of a new
editorship. It is the reaffirmation
of the “willingness to contemplate
what is happening” which we have
advocated for so long.

New Habits

brings the residence halls at long
last into the present era, and
insures at least a slight decrease in
the depression which tends to grip
the freshman at Davidson each fall.

Along with the fond remembrances
of the old Watts and the awe of the
new Watts Hilton, however, comes
the necessity of an admonition.

Lest we judge ourselves more ma-
ture than in previous years, we
should stop to remember the water
fights and the senseless destruction
of campus property which occurred
during past years in the dorms.

Such acts cannot be tolerated this
year. The appreciation which has
been often expressed by upperclass-
men and freshmen this fall should
not co: erely of words.

The observance of restraint in the
dorms should not only apply to fresh-
men, but also to upperclassmen, some
of whom have been weaned on water
raids and shaving cream fights.

We always said Watts had the best
rooms.

A False Start

For séveral years students have
been yelling for an alteration in the
School’s orientation process, say-
ing that too much of the information

A Coach
At. Last.

The complexities of the Larry

- Brown resignation are puzzling and

still unclarified; but out of the storm

that blew in Davidson in July came

the assurance that Davidson would
still have a top-notch coach.

No matter what happened to Larry
Brown, Davidson basketball will not
suffer long, for into his place and into
the big shoes of Brown’s predecessor
walked a man who can fill the job
(if not the shoes).

Terry Holland knows all of the ins
and outs of Davidson basketball; he
knows the complexities, that_accom-
pany the efforts to recruit around
Davidson’s striet academic structure;
and he has the respect ‘and the friend-
ship of every one with whom he
works.

While everyone in the South is
questioning Holland's future and won-
dering about the fate of Wildcat bas-
-ketball, we feel confident that he is
the best man for the job. We felt
that way before the storm in July,
and Holland himself has confirmed
our confidence.

and procedure was duplicated and
that the process was too drawn out.

Now, after one week of concentra-
ted orientation, some feel that the
old way was better, or at least that
some changes must again be made.

It seems that the largest problem
was once again the Freshman Camp.
It_wasn’t that it was too long or bor-
ing, and it wasn’t that facts .were
duplicated there, as the charge has
been in past years.

Through no fault of a very capable
camp staff, the camp has simply
lost its place in the Davidson orien-
tation. This year the travel to Camp
Thunderbird was a burden rather
than a pleasure. Most of the activities
could have been carried out at David-
son with no loss of perspective.

The point was especially made
with the attempt to register the fresh-
men at the camp. essors express-
ed displeasure with the pressure and
poor conditions—under which fresh-
men were placed as they tried to
figure out their class schedules.

The fact which no one is willing to
admit is that in a hurried-up orienta-
tion Pp ‘no place.
The whole spirit of relaxation and the
ability to meet one’s contemporaries
is cut off by trying to cram everything
into two nights and one day. The
whole purpose. of the old freshman
camp is lost in the new process.

And it was too cold, too.

Nixon Promises

To Reform Draft

A NEWS ANALYSIS

Now that students are once
more filling the halls of
American colleges and uni-
versities, the Nixon admini-
stration is making new ef-
forts to reform one of stu-
dent radicals’ prime targets—
the Selective Service System.

The administration's Draft
Reform Bill has been de
layed in Congress. So Nixon
aides are reportedly work-
ing on an executive order
which would institute draft
reforms without waiting for
Congressional action.

President Nixon stressed
his concern over present in-
equities in the draft when he
spoke to the National Gov-
ernors’ Conference Sept.1.

He said he attached ‘‘spe-
cial priority as a matter of
high principle’’ to draft re-
form and added, ‘Until
peacetime. conditions ‘make
an all-volunteer armed force
possible—while the draft re-
mains. necessary—it is im-
perative that we make it as
nearly fair as possible, and
that we reduce to a minimum
the unnecessarily long. per-

iod of uncertaintly that now
hangs over the lives of mil-
lions of our young people.”’

Sources close to the Pres-
ident say that his proposal
will end the present policy of
drafting the oldest eligible
men, those 25 and 26 years
old. Instead it will call for
drafting the youngest, the 19-
year olds, first. Thus a nine-
teen year old who is not
drafed would likely miss the
draft altogether, except in
case of national emergency.

However, students who en-
joy college deferments would
face a one year period of
high draft eligibility after
graduation.

Nixon's Draft Reform Bill
also calls for a national hot-
tery which would draft stu-
dents at random. This meas-
ure will require Congression-
al approval since the~ 1967
draft law specifically forbade
such a system.

On September 19, Nixon
announced that. November
and December draft calls
would be canceled, and that
the October call for 30,000
men would be stretched over
the remainder of the year.

Applause again for this dead
master.

*-And the film ends,
and with cries of “more,

Some film critics would say
that the work leaves some-
thing to be desired as a docu-
mentary, but it says more
about young people and their
music, their life style, than
any Hollywood flick has
ever said.

But the
dary to the serious, sad, and
often depressing side of Arlo
Guthrie’s adventures as a
college drop-out folk artist
trying to pick up where his
father left off.

The movie is very bio-
graphical, and it appears
that Arlo no longer has the
carefree attitude toward life
and the trials life brings
that he had when he penned
the song. There are poignant
scenes in the movie as Arlo
thinks of his dying father,
folk singer Woody Guthrie,
and as he later visits his
parents with Pete Seeger.

There are also serious
scenes involving a friend of
Arlo's who is hooked on her-
oin, attempts to kick his ad-
diction, and ends up dead
from an overdose.

There is no indictment of
grass, by the way, as Arlo
and his friends frequently
pass the joint.

There sis somewhat of an
indictment - - or a question-
ing at any rate - - of the
“beautiful people” life which
Alice and her husband Ray
Brock try to live.

The couple becomes less
happy and sure of itself as
the film progresses and more
worried over the futures of
friends.

The

couple buys an old

church (in Great Barring-
ton, Mass.) and turns it into
a commune for hip friends.
Alice also starts a restaurant

By FRANKLIN ANDERSON

Little can be more unhap-
py for a person than to feel
unneeded, irrelevant or gen-
erally out of place; The feel-
ing is at best uncomfortable,
and can lead to a walling out
of the reality that reminds
the person of his disjointed-
ness with the enviroment.

Such is the problem that
Davidson College faces. It
isn’t just the question of co-
education or church relation-
ship or social patterns, or
any of the other specifics
which scores of committees

and commissions have con- .

sidered.

The real question at the
bottom is identity, which is
unfortunate for three rea-
sons: First, it is the wrong

question. Second, even if
identity were the question, it
hasn't really been consider-
ed, probably because it’s too
basic and scarry.

And third, the vague ap-

' proximations of the question

that have been proposed
have been in the hands of
five separate commissions,
who deliver their findings
over to an outside agency
which can then play psy-
choanalyist to a five-sided
schizophrenic.

This disjoined semi-con-

~ sideration of identity hurts

the college because there has
to be a willingness to go as
far as necessary, to find and
accept the facts no matter
what the facts are, before a
really thorough reexamina-
tion can proceed.

Granted, the college has
gone deeper than the self-
Study report or the blue sky-
ing, but it has yet to say
that it is ready to accept —
if this be the case—that the
liberal arts college has seen
its day or that religious af-
filiation has to go. :

What Davidson will lack as
a result of its halfway con-
sideration of its identity is
the assurance that the iden-
tity is worthwhile, that
Davidson can function as a
Christian, liberal arts school
and accomplish something.

The irony of the situation
is that Davidson Co] lege
would come through — such
analysis with its identity un-
scathed, although with much
criticism of- the expression
of that identity. This is why
identity is the wrong ques-
tion. What is at issue is the
expression of ‘the identity:
the action, not the essence.

The college's full accept-
ance of itself is a step along
the road to expression of it-
self freely and effectively,
but the problem is that
commissions, committees
and college as a whole are
hung up on giving identity a
half-way consideration, and
mistaking this half-way con-
sideration for the real thing.

The effect of this will cer-
tainly not be disastrous by

the college with a nagging
insecurity about itself when
it should be dealing with the
problems of the outside
world.

spection and get qn with
