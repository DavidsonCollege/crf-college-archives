Men's Track Overcomes Elements

By Peter Hurtado

The opening two weeks of the
men’s outdoor track and field sea-
son were highlighted by several
gutsy performances despite little
cooperation from mother nature.

After stormy weather can-
celledameetat UNC-Wilmington,
the men braved the elements in
meets at Florida St. and St. Augus-
tine.
Senior Dave Kerns provided
the most heroic effort of the sea-
son, as he survived an ill-timed
hail storm at St. Augustine this

past Saturday to run an outstand- |

ing 3000m steeplechase time of

. 9:29.4. Kerns was well on his way

to breaking the 15-year old school
record of 9:26.5, when rain turned
to hailstones for the final two laps
of the race.

Kerns’ outstanding time ranks
him among the best in the South-
ern Conference.

Co-captain Duncan Spears
became the top 400m hurdler in
the Southern Conference with his
55.56 clocking at Florida St. Se-
nior Ian Stewart recorded solid

performances of 15:38 at his birth-
place, Florida St., and 15:34 at St.
Augustine.

The men’s 4x800m relay
squad was led by Erik McMichael’s
1:59 split, as the squad of
McMichael, Mike Grant, Joe Beach
and Peter Hurtado ran the 3rd best
ever at Davidson (8:07).

As the squad regroups follow-
ing illness and spring break, sev-
eral athletes will challenge the
Conference’s best. The team trav-
elsto Emory University next week-
end.

8-6 win. Despite losing at number
three, Davidson picked up the
doubles point, by winning two of
the three matches.

The match then moved into
the singles competition, where
Davidson has excelled all year.

Picking up wins were Briggs 6-2,
6-0, Holt Vaughan 6-3, 6-1, Dan
Grinnan 6-0, 6-2, and Dave
Tonidandel 6-3, 6-2. Varoski lost
to an outstanding player at number
one, and David Jespersen, still ail-
ing from a back injury, was beaten
in a tough three set match.

This latest win leaves Coach
