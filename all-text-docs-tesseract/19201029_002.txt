On the Gridiron |

When the Wildcats get on a rampage
it takes more than a Spider to stop
them.

Two in a row is a pretty fair start.
Let’s make it three straight victories
next Saturday.

lo

The Spiders had a strong web in the
center but it was weak around the
edges, and as soon as “Spratt,” the wild
little quarter of the Wildcats, discov-
ered it, he sent his men around the ends
and tore the web to shreds.

Citadel.

Citadel next Saturday? Well, I reck-
on.
Cadets from Charleston, but it is well
not to be over confident The last time

we played them, on Sprunt field in 1916, |

they held us to a 7 to 7 tie.

The Cadets won a game from Wofford
Saturday by a margin of 19 points.
this game both her quarterback and
fullback did splendid work and showed
that they were men to be feared on the
gridiron.

The men from Richmond University
showed themselves to be truce sports
and gentlemen, for even when the game
was going against them, they did not
resort to rough tactics or dirty playing.
We enjoy playing such a bunch.

U. of S. C. ve. P. C.

The two schools in South Carolina put
up a stellar brand of football, but the
State’s proteges finally edged over two
touchdowns on the huskies from P. C.

. North vs. South.

Intersectional games started with a
“bang” when Pitt and Harvard nosed
out Tech and Centre. Both the teams
from below the Mason and Dixon line
fought a grim battle but the heavier
northern teams finally wore them out.

V. M. I. continued her wining streak
when she upset the dope by pouncing
on Pennsy and by shaking, rattling and
rolling 27 points out of her. U. of P.
gathered only 7 points.

Yale took West Virginia into camp
with a 24 to 0 score.

N. C. State vs. U. of N.C.

State gained her revenge on the Uni-
versity during the past week by beat-
ing her 13 to 3. The boys from Chapel
Hill fought hard but succumbed before
the smashing onslought of Coach “Bills”
lads.

Two of the greatest Southern teams
clash this week-end. Tech plays Cen-
tre. The gridiron fans will have a chance
to compare the great “Buck” Flowers
with the peerless “Bo” McMillan. Both

are captains and are, without a doubt,|,

two of the greatest football artists
produced in the last decade.
Furman.

The South Carolina Baptists hung a
17 to ©o sign all over Wake Forest.
Coach Laval has turned out a fell-round-
ed team and “Speedy” Speer is going
better than ever. We will have to get
tuned up for this last game of the year,
for they are thirstirng to wipe out the
41 to 14 score that was handed them last
season.

THE DAVIDSONIAN, OCTOBER 29, 1920.

CAROLINA FRESHMEN
FALL BEFORE KITTENS
Game Clean and Fiercely Contested
Throughout.

In as good a football game as has ever
been witnessed on Sprunt Field, the
Scrubs triumphed over the much heavier
Carolina Freshmen team by a score of
10-0, The Wildkittens put up a brand
of play that would have done credit to
any varsity, and outplayed .and out-
fought Carolina at every stage of the
game. .

At the initial kick-off a comparison of
the two teams gave scant hope for a
Davidson victory, but the Scrubs soon
ambly demonstrated that weight is not
everything in football. The Carolina

ier per man than the line of Captain

out to win, and putting up the wonder-
ful game they did, they deserved noth-
ing less. The visitors were handicapped
by a lack of real hard scrimmaging pre-

In! vious to the game and as a result suf-

fered frequently from temporary in-
juries received at the hands of their
hardened opponents. The Wildkittens
outplayed their opponents more than

)the score would indicate and were kept

\from scoring by only narcow margins.
It was a clean cut victory and the Scrubs
deserve all the credit possible.

During the first half the Scrubs work-

.ed their shift to great advantage, the!

new born Tarheels apparently having

met with nothing of the kind before. |

The whole backfield worked well, and
Clary especially made long gains around
the ends whenever called on. At the
end of the first half the score stood 0-0,
; but in the third frame the Scrubs push-
ted over their first initial counter. Clary

put the ball within striking distance of |

the goal by a pretty 3§ yard run, and
soon thereafter Dantzler brought the
spectators to their feet by a fine piece
of broken field running which netted
the first touchdown. Dantzler again
responded nobly in the fourth period to
a call for a drop kick, and though in
very crowded circumstances, planted
the ball between the uprights -for a field
goal from the 25 yard line.

The whole Scrub team gave their best
and it is a hard matter to pick any par-
ticular stars. The line did well though
they were so much outweighed. ‘Knight
and McLaughlin stood out prominently
and Richards on end several times did

SALISBURY GOLFERS |
WIN FROM DAVIDSON

Darkness Allows Only 12 Holes to
be Completed.

The pro-tempus golf team composed |
of Messrs. White, Sample, Fricker and:
Doubles journeyed over to Salisbury last
week to test their skill. ree trans- |
portation was furnished by Dr. J. L.!
Douglass, whose services are greatly ap-
preciated. The match was only a prac- .
tice as the real intercollegiate matches |
come off after the golf team is picked. :
Messrs. Sample and White opposed!
Messrs. Lloyd and Walker. Starting:
late caused darkness to overtake the!
players on the t2th hole with Salisbury
cin lead 4 up. The remaining 6 holes had
therefore to be abandoned just as Dav-
idson was beginning to show rare form.
The course being in somewhat bad con-
dition tended to off-set Davidson's play-
ing; nevertheless they did their best as
is always typical of D. C. in any form of
athletics, The team was entertained
during their short stay royally by the
Salisbury Club to whom they wish to
,extend their heartiest thanks. :
! Manager White announces a return

[match on the Davidson Links Thursday ‘

jafternoon. The Eliminating contest to!

regular golf team will be held at a date
to be announced later. The team will
represent Davidson in all the inter-
collegiate matches for which several
| have been scheduled. For benefit of the
players next Thursday—listen fellows—.
let’s all turn out and help Davidson get
revenge by repeating its feat of last)
year. Will you come?

Oh, No! V. M. 1. isn’t going at all,
strong this year. The Cadets let |
Roanoke College down by a 54 to 0:
score, and last week smothered

so bad. More R. O. T. C.
