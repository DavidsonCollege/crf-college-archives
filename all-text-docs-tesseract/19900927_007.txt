A Concerned Parent Writes

Happily enough, Davidsonis a
Christian college operating in the
A.D. era of grace. The gift of

God’s grace (His pardon) was given

almost 2000 years ago when His
Son hung on the Cross in order to
protect us from the dreaded conse-
quence of our fallen human nature:
alienation from our holy Creator.

In a way, ‘Davidson reflects
God’s grace when it provides
condoms to protect users from the
dreaded consequence of pre-mari-
tal sex: pregnancy or, worse, AIDS.

So you’re safe: Safe from life-

changing or life-destroying conse-
quences. Safe with a “cover up”
that will protect youre good kid
image. Safe to act on impulse, to
relieve a physical urge when it
might occur.

The condom is as close as the
hall bathroom: Safe, so that with
the provided aid of condoms, no
sporting male or female can really
have reason to say “‘no

Anyway, what can be so awful

about showing another person
some affection? Many fellow stu-
dents don’t come from loving
homes. God knows, they need
affirmation. Some desperately
need the kind of total acceptance

God has set His moral
standard to be a better
protection than rubber

can provide...
a eee

that only total naked disclosure in
arelationship can bring.

And college is a magical, rela-
tively irresponsible time, anall too
brief period when pleasure can be
hinderéd by commitments. Make
‘hay while the sun shines. So much
to enjoy, to have NOW. But a
warning should be posted on every
first aid box: “Warning! You'll
never forget the first time.” There
is nothing more personal that you

can give... and years (you don’t
- know when) down the road when
you take your marriage vows, there
will be nothing more that you can
than youalready give to... whom-
ever. Likea haunting curse, you'll
never be able to recapture the sin-
gular significance of that first time.
Condoms do protect you from
some unwanted consequences of
pre-marital sex. Condoms do not
protect you from the most devas-
tating consequence of all - the loss
of meaning attached to the most
loving gift you have to give.

Sex will serve as a powerful
bond within your marriage, but
only if it hasn’t been demeaned by
an extra-marital relationship. God
has sct His moral standard to be a
better protection than rubber can
provide... He wants to protect you
and your future marital relation-
ship. He cares about you.

Why the

Having spent several lonely
nights thinking about how they
make simulated wood grain vinyl
and why you can’t eat what’s in
those little packets that come with
stereo equipment, and if I should
gct those pectoral implants, and
how much my roommate looks
like one of the before pictures in
those Hair Club for Men commer-
cials, and whether or not I should
bother calling one of those swing-
ing hip party lines for people with
social lives as active as my Own or
maybe one of those Phone Confes-
sion numbers so I can make up
stories about my past and tell them
to complete strangers over the
phone, and about how maybe we
were never meant to have existed
in the first place and this whole
universe thing might just be the
result of some divine flatulation, I

- decided to get some sort of hold on
my thoughts and I directed my
neuroses towards this Helms -

“Gantt nonsense,

, Some of you may remember
my suggesting the institutionaliza-
tion of both of America’s Jesses in
the first installment of this col-
umn; and while I still think that
such action will be both necessary
and amusing in the future, I believe
we ought to give him another six
years in Washington first.

Yes, that’s right, I’m endors-
ing Jesse Helms for the United
States Senate, Aghast, are you?
Then you obviously don’t under-
stand the innumerable benefits of

being represented by an old age

mutant ninja fascist. Really, what —
do youhave against good old fash-
ioned family values anyway?

| Rude Notes and Random Scribblings

Helms Not?

You do know, of course, that

not to love Jesse is not to love.

America; and not to love America
is to be a heathen, pagan, homo-
sexual swine from the ‘darkest
bowels of hell who darcs to blas-
pheme against the divinely inspired
system of free cnterprisc and thus
stands to incur the wrath of the
blessed and chosen lord: judge
almighty on high, Jesscus.. (Ex-
cuse the religious fervor).

Inall seriousness though, North
Carolinians necd the kind of wis-
dom and leadership that only our
friend the sinister sexagenarian can
provide. Political genius that he is,
Jesse - Baby (as, it is rumored, his
friends and various love slaves call
him) managed to distract the na-
tion from the massive Savings and
Loan Debacle by having aconnip-
tion fit on the floor of the Senate
over the work of Robert Mapple-
thorpe. (Inside information sug-
gests, however, that the outbursts

were brought about more by Mr.

Helms’s desire to look at dirty
pictures and needing an excuse to
have them in his office rather than
a politically strategic ploy).

- But let’s not forget Jesse’s
ferventdefensc of North Carolina’ s-

textile industries from the commu-
nistic environmental legislation
sponsored by that way out,: Icft
wing, ruskie hugging urbe,
George Bush,

Individual “inaunioes of the.

Helms magic aside, the overall
effect of the ultimate J - Man’s
works should not be disregarded in
November. Thanks to the Bible-
thumping-backwater-redncck-on-
acid style of senatorship Jesse has

embraced while in office, we’ve
managed to fool the rest of the
country regarding what we North
Carolinians are really like.

Ask someone from, say,
Yonkers what they think a North
Caroliniam is like, and he’ll de-
scribe your basic inbred moron,
who’s only worn shoes when it
was snowing or when he was get-
ting married to one of his cousins.

The good thing about such an
impression is that Mr. Yonkers, in
his skin tight, see - thru fishnet
tank top shirt and his bushy, lox
and bagel crumbriddlcd mustache,
and his designer jeans and his God
forsaken goldchains from the disco
cra, will probably never show his
face in our most beautiful'and be-
loved section of the country. How
can this be bad? Sure, we have a
raving lunatic as a Senator, but he
serves a purpose.

Duc to his antics in Washing-

ton, few people know that North

~ Carolina is actually a wonderful

state with a wealth of superior citi-

zens, and, in my opinion, that’s
just fine.

When Claude Pepper was one

of Florida’s. representatives, his

--combination of age, intelligence .

and integrity suggested that Flor-
ida might be a nice Place: for old
people to reside. -:

Today that state is abaolutely

riddled with bluc hair, orange for-
mica, shag carpeting and Buicks.
As long as Jessc Helms remains in
the public eye as our Senator, that

won thappen here. Let’skecp out -

the rest of the idiots by having our

biggestoneatthe gate. Really folks, »

- why the Helms not? .

sure Ought to. On the map I got
from the police, open lots arc
marked green, our spaces are ycl-
low, and I think faculty spaces
orange. We have our spaces, they
have theirs. Of course, on the weck-
ends, when the faculty spaces lie
emply, they look awfully inviting.
Trickery! Actually, they’re stu-
dent car traps‘on weekends. You
park there, you: still get towed,
even though they do sit open...all
weckend long.

_. Suggestions
1. Ifa student’s car is going to be
damaged, then give a few extra
dollars on the fine. Don’t just tow

Collins, a Cranky Guy

it and screw up the car. That’s
rude.
2. Makc the faculty/staff lots open
parking on weckends.
3. Nail the faculty and staff just
like everyonc else. If they take our
spots, then tow them. That is only
fair.
4. Try giving warnings.
5. A question: If the Texaco
station only gets 15 dollars to tow
a car, and the tickct-is like forty
bucks, where is the 25 cxtra going.
Huh, Bobbo?
6. Bob, listen to some soft music or
something in the morning. You
surc are a cranky guy.

If you don’t, we might just...
tow your car.
