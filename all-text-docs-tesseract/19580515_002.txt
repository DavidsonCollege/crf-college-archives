Staples Speech Ends Silence

Dr. George Staples’. speech in
chapel last Thursday was; a refresh-
ing change from’ the customary of-
ficial silence conceraing possible re-
forms in Davidson's traditional
methods of education. His “fourteen
points” are noteworthy not only on
their own merit but also as an in-
dication that at least some members
of the faculty and administration
have positive ideas on this matter.

Dr. Staples’ proposals embody the
lessons gained from many years of
experimentation in the best colleges
in the country. “Core™ courses for the
required curriculum, a strong honors
program. unlimited cuts for students
on the dean's list—all these would do
much toward removing the boredom
that pervades our present required
courses and would help establish

powerful incentives for students able
and willing to do advanced work of
high quality.

Other points in the speech con-
cerned plain necessities which have
been neglected too long, even by Da-
vidson’s rather flexible standards. The
existence of one-man departments in
subjects as important as political
science, sociology, and philosophy is
unthinkable in a liberal arts school
of our size.

T. S. Eliot has expressed frustra-
tion and futility by the phrase, “I have
measured out my life with coffee
spoons.” At Davidson we have been
spoon-fed altogether too long. We
hope that in the future an attitude of
willingness to make changes and
abandon traditions will itself become
a Davidson Tradition.—C.H.C.

A New
President's Ideas

(Editor's note: this editorial was
reprinted from THE DAVIDSON-
JAN of November 18, 1931. It was
written by D. Grier Martin, editor-
in chief.)

The University of North Carolina
is to be congratulated on their new
President, Dr. Frank Graham.

In his inaugural address the new
President expressed his ideas in re-
gard to freedom in a college or uni-
versity. A part of his talk follows:

“Freedom in a university runs
a varied course and has a wide
meaning. It means the freedom of
students with their growing citi-
zenship to govern themselves in
campus affairs, and the right of
lawful. assembly and. free discus-
sions by any students from any-
where on ahy issues and any views
whatsoever.

“For the faculty. freedom means
the right of the faculty to control
the curriculum, scholastic stan-
dards, and especially matters per-
taining to intellectual excellence;
to teach and speak freely. not as
propagandists, but as scholars and
seekers for the truth with a sense
of responsibility to the truth for
the teacher's part in the develop-
ment of the whole youthful per-
sonality: to organize their own in-
dependent association for discys-

«sion and statement of views, and

as an organic part of the university
help shape university. policies by
votes, representation, advice. and.
may we hope, a larger sharing in
the life of the university and the
people of the state.”

In both of these views on freedom,
Dr. Graham strikes a phase of college
life which is up to standard in few of
the colleges of the state; and David-
son i$ not among the leaders in this
line.

For A Job
Well Done

This has been a trying year for
Davidson College. Many people have
been called on to fill roles left va-
cant and many have had to play
roles created by events.

Over on ‘the hill’ men have been
at work doing jobs that go unrecog-
nized and often they receive criticism
for the tasks which they have graci-
ously concented to perform, all in the
attempt to lead the pilotless ship.

Those who have seen the labors
of men like Dr. Pietenpol and Dr.
Bailey and the spirit in which they
have kept the college running can-
not but be impressed by the caliber

of the work they have done—it isn’t
the flawless work of a perfectly-func-
tioning machine, but rather it is the
more crude product with visible flaws,
which is often to be the more ap-
preciated because to err is human.

Pietenpol, Bailey, Martin, ‘Henge-
veld—these are the ‘names’ in this
league, but it is not to them alone
that we direct our appreciation for
carrying on under the pressures and
difficulties of the impermanent ad-
ministration. It is to the entire staff
that have devoted their time and ef-
fort to seeing that Davidson College
keeps afloat that THE DAVIDSONIAN
tips its hat for a job well done.

If We Miss
The Torpedoes

Revised Bidding seems to be go-
ing the way of all innovations, down
the drain. The IFC will take its final
vote on the issue tonight, and we may
be pleasantly surprised by its pas-
sage, but this is unlikely.

Few issues have, been more dis-
cussed on campus than this one, and
the discussion thus far has failed to
turn up any significant flaws in the
systent.

The most consistent argument ad-
vanced by those opposing the new
system has been, ‘Well, down at our
house. we just don’t want anybody
telling us what to do.”

The discussion in progress usually
ends on this statement because from.
here on appeals to logic, common
sense, altruism, and intelligence are
futile.

Bull headedness has been a trait’
of the Anglo Saxon race for thousands
of years, especially Calvinistic Anglo
Saxons, so we suppose that these at-
titudes should come as no real sur-
prise.

At times, and occasions, such
strongness of will can be valuable—
“Damn the torpedoes, full speed
ahead,” valuable that is if you miss
the torpedoes. THE DAVIDSONIAN
wonders if the fraternity system will
avoid them.

At any rate, pass or fail, it was,
and still is a good idea. Vernon Ander-
son and Richard Brubaker, originators
of the plan are to be thanked for
their work on it, and congratulated
on the forceful manner in which they
presented Revised Bidding.

Perhaps a seed has been sown
which will eventually take hold in
the Student Body and produce the
desired reforms at some later date.
We hope so.

Interim Rule Of Acting President Pietenpol
'Has Maintained Equilibrium And Tradition

By BOBBY LIVINGSTON

Dr, Pietenpol became Acting
President of Davidson College
with the resignation of Dr.
Cunningham. In retrospect. it
becomes apparent that he has
headed a sort of loose coimit-
tee-type leadership whose prim-
ary aim has been to maintain
equilibrium.

Other prominent figures in
this cabinet are Mr. D. Grier
Martin, Dr. MeGavock, Dean
Bailey, and the faculty acting as
a unit.

The accomplishments and
failures of this administra-
tion must be measured in
light of its self-set aim. Per-
haps by the very nature
of its decision, Davidson has
not felt the strong leader-
ship it enjoyed in the past.
But at the seme time, the
traditional goals and im-
plementing plans have not
suffered.

In terms of long term ambi-
tion, this has been especially
true. The college has not lost
stature in the fiercely compet-
itive. field of prestige. It has
obtained a typically outstanding
incoming freshman class. It has
continued to attract strong fi-
nancial support.

vidson has witnessed sharp
alteration in this interim.
A new fraternity court, e
much-needed addition to
the library, and “Martin’s
Gulch” have advanced ac-
cording to existing plans.

The college received during
this period from Mr. Chartes A.
Dana the largest contribution
ever offered by a living individ-
ual.

In terms of the immediate
college life, the administration
has functioned in the face of
crisis, partly of its own choos-
ing. Its policy has been pegged
for the hour. Its greatest re-
striction has been its obvious
interim character. It has borne
the brunt of serious local situ-
ations.

The strong mark of Piet-
enpol is revealed in the
frankness on all occasions
with which those in control
have treated the students.
This hes been appreciated
by the student body’s evi-
dent concern for the wel-
fare of Davidson College.

Dean Bailey has imparted a
sincerity and dignity to all the
deliberations in his province.
He demonstrated a willingness
to provide leadership in a per-

and a desire to let things work
themselves out in less demand-
ing areas.

cieved one of the most un
intended but yet serious as-
saults upon its value in the
history of its existence. tt
has endured, strengthened
by the student? body’s great-
er awareness of its signiti-
cance.

Hell Week was abolished by
the IFC after the faculty chose
Skit Night to illustrate the need
of an evaluation of the ideals
of the student body. What could
have been a student rebellion
turned into a strong affirma-
tion for the faculty's general
decision to insist upon a tra-
ditional ideal.

The faculty has responded to
this approval by deliberate cau-
tion in imposing any specific
testrictions upon any activity.
It has been seeking, however,
causes and solutions for ex-
cesses in student religious con-
duct, drinking, and dance week-
ends.

The student council partici-
pated somewhat in this, and its
putency was illustrated by a re-
turn to decency in vespers for

Staples Speech Praised,
Student Dress Is Criticized

Coat & Tie

Dear Abbie’

I won’t be trite by saying that
I have a problem, but I do. I
come from a nice family. I
went to high school. While living
under the influence of these
two mediums I learned the
positive values of social graces
and neat appearance.

IT found that knowing I was
neatly attired gave me confi-
dence, gave me a more optimist-
ic outlook, and enhanced others
reactions to me.

My mother is a Southern
Lady, Faulkner would call her
that; Eleanor Roosevelt would
call her degenerate Southern
aristocracy—you know the type.
But she believes in God and the
frivolity of youth so she sent
me to Davidson College, a safe
place, that I might obtain, along
with an education, certain of
the social graces necessary to
identify one with his native sec-
tion.

I have attended Davidson for
three years. In the course of
those three years I have shot

Ten Commandments, written

five research themes, ruined
seven shirts in chemistry
courses. I am well-rounded, a
potential future leader. Yet I
have forgotten what it is to be
neatly attired, to shave anytime
other than Saturday afternoon,
or to smile optimistically in
the morning.

These are results of being
part of the Davidson College so-
cial system. At first, because
I was young and naive, I fought
the system. I was ostracized. I
became unpopular. Who likes
people who wear ties to classes?
I was an outsider, so I con-
formed. Next year I will make
my appearance in society again.
I am completely unprepared for
the exodus. I do not hold any
hope for myself. I only wish to
save new students from the
same initial shock and coma of
indifference that I experienced.

Is it possible that there are
some here, besides myself, who
feel that along with the change
in administration, Davidson Col-
lege could stand a change in
the attire of her students—
preferably a change to coat and
tie?

Hours Well Spent

Dear Editor:

I would like to publicly con-
gratulate Dr. Staples on_ his
chapel talk to the Student Body
last week. The several points he
mentioned are well worth seri-
ous consideration by the stu-
dents, the faculty and the ad-
ministration.

There are few who realize
that “Davidson is not as
outstanding es we think it
is. We tend to pat our-
selves on the back for be-
ing 8 part of such a great
institution.

But if outsiders don’t. share
the same sentiments, maybe we
are wrong in our self-analysis.

Let's get one thing
straight. There’s no place
for tradition in education.
Advances are being made
in the theory of education
and Davidson is slow to
keep pace. .

Dr. Staples has accounted for
his many hours with the ‘“caf-
feine philosophers” and has
shown that they were well
spent.

Boyd Clark

whose conduct it had requested

to be made responsible.

Specific student criticism
focused on such items as a
curriculum justified more
by tradition than by the
ideal of a complete educa-
tion, and the observation
upon reflection that the
faculty as a whole perhaps

OVER THE HILL

evaded the root of apparent

problems to arrive at solu-

tions for particuler situa-
tions.

The Pietenpol era has been
relentless in its desire to keep
things as they were. The ac-
complishment of its aim must
be admitted. Its weakness was
inherent to its structure.

What We Need Is

By TOM KERNAN

“Well, they are going to give us a new president to-
morrow; I didn’t think they would ever get around to
it.” The speaker was the beloved Professor of Advanced
Harmonica, Percy Dewlips. I was sharing a table with
him while sopping up the usual morning purgative of
Union coffee. Beowulf Brawn, Coach of Yogi and Chris-
tian Sunbathing, and Prof. Covington Clogg, Ethiopian
Etymology, were engaged in the same pastime.

“Are you hopeful of any changes in policy, sir?” t

asked.

“Certainly,” he replied. “Whoever he may be, and
I must say they needn’t have looked beyond their own
backyard — but whoever he may be, he can’t help but
realize the need for a new music hall. My harmonica

classes simply can’t play against the drafts in Shearer,
when the wind comes through those cracks in the wall.

Every period, someone gets the hiccoughs.”
“An’ a sunporch too,” said Coach Brawn.
“Beg pardon, Beowulf,” said Prof. Clogg, “but why

do we need a sunporch.”

“Cause then the students could sunbathe in the win-
ter; honestly, Prof. Clogg, if you could see their white,

shivering, little bodies, when they come down to the gym,
it would break your heart.” A large, saline tear slithered
down his cheek and plummeted noisily into his coffee.

“A typical Philistine outlook,” jeered Prof. Clogg,
angrily crumbling the remains of a doughnut in his fist.
“You all want a Santa Claus or a Wall Street Wizard,
someone who can fatten the college ‘kitty.’ What we need
is a man with some real intellectual insight.”

“Druther have a sunporch,” said Coach Brown sullen-

ly.

“All very well for you to talk, Clogg, when you're
over in Chambers where it’s warm and dry and there
aren't any nasty insects crawling around in your desk,”

said Prof. Dewlips.

“1 can’t help it if your course attracts that particular

segment of the animal world,” Prof. Clogg replied acidly.
Prof. Dewlips answered ‘by depositing the remainder

of his coffee in his colleague’s countenance, whereupon
Prof. Clogg grasped his opponent’s tie and made as if to
leave the room, with its wearer still attached. Coach Brawn
joined the fray, attempting to subdue the contestants but
receiving only a blow in the abdomen for his troubles.
Acting the part of a neutral, I slipped off through the

crowd of spectators.

“| wonder if getting a new president is worth all this

trouble,” I said to the counterman.

)

“Well, | reckon someone has to keep the faculty mem-
bers from killing each other. Me, I'd rather work here be-

hind the counter.”

THE ICONOCLAST

CHRISTAIN DIDACTICS

By BRUCE W. VAN SANT

With all the innovations the
school is planning, from a new
science building to a new pres-
ident, there is a segment in
the curriculum, long = un-inno-
vated, which has been disre-
garded. This is in the Bible de-
partment.

As the school is responsible
to the Presbytery, it is feasible
that a theological course be re-
quired of its students to further
those ideals for which the stu-
dent selected Davidson. The
question now occurs: Do these
courses further or hinder those
ideals? It is evident that after
early Church training, Sunday
School, and Young People’s dis-
cussion Groups, the student en-
tering college is aware of the
historic significance of certain
biblical names -and carries a
rather full repertoire of Bible
stories.

Re-telling these tales in big
words merely serves to tarnish

their lustre of tradition and may
have some thinking that with all
this repetition, perhaps their
meaning is not so deep after
all, for the college rendition is
no more advanced than the Sun
day School one.

Perhaps this was realized
when the administration decid-
ed to offer an experimental
choice to Freshmen next year.
One section will be able to

choose whether they want the
usual Bible 11-J]2, or a pair of
vaguely similar courses. Ah-ha!
someone has been thinking!

Whoever he was, he must
have been a timid soul, for Bi-
ble Stories 21-22 is still the on-
ly out for Sophomores.

In addition to the relative in-
éffectiveness of these two
courses there remains the fact
that they are intransferrable to
most institutions, and because
of the high student fatality
rate between the freshman and
senior year, which is continual-,
ly being worn as a badge of
academic achievement by the
college, this is a strong argu-
ment against the courses as
they now stand. How do the
courses stand now? As far as
Presbyterian concepts are con-
cerned, John Calvin goes un-
mentioned beyond the history
classroom. As far as Christian
precepts are concerned, their
surfaces are merely dusted
be careful not to scratch them!

The solutions to the problems
outlined are so various and sim-
ple, one can arrive at quite a
few even without a staff of ex-
perts on Christian didactics
and academics as there exists in
the Bible department.

A toothsome battery of
courses can be lined up which
will provide both new knowl-
edge and intellectual exercises
for the masses and needed
credit for the pre-mins; that will
be palatable, if not interesting;
at the least transferrable, at
the most, at the college level.

While we are in the mood for
change, let’s not forget the re-
quired religion courses: their
value can be heightened con-
siderably, and they can at least
have a more collegiate ring to
them when they appear on a
transcript.
