Rev. Ansley

C. Moore

Leads Vespers Sunday

Three Great Choices in Life
of Man Is Subject of
Florida Pastor

On last Sunday evening, April
23, the vesper service was. led by
the Rev. Mr. Ansley C.
who is pastor of the Presbyterian
church of Clearwater, Fla. The sub-
ject of the sermon was “The Three
Great Choices in the Life of Every
Man.”

The Rev. Mr.
sermon by pointing out that in the
life of each person there are three
important choices that must be
made: the cHéice of a life work,
the choice of a life mate, and the

Moore,

Moore began his

choice of a life master. These
three choices should be realized
and faced by everyone with the

Idea of coming to a decision that
will -best help the individual lead
a good life.

Life Plan
There is a detailed plan for the
life of everyone, believes Mr.

Moore, and this is realized because
God, wyth all of His infinite plans
and sygtems for nature, would sure-
ly not have neglected making a plan
for the life of his most important
creature, Man. If He did have a
plan, he would hardly keep it con-
cealed, but would put it to work
as He does in our lives each day.

Each man should choose wisely
his life work, the true
happiness of life depends upon the
profession that each man chooses.
The important choice of a mate is
shown here, for even though the
correct profession is chosen, the
unwise choice of a mate can dis-
rupt the whole plan, pointed out
Mr. Moore. The choice of a_spir-
itual master is vital to the choice

because

of a profession and a mate, for a
wrong master will lead the life in
the wrong direction, but if Christ
is chosen as our master, we can
never go wrong.

The Rey. Mr. Moore closed his

sermon by again quoting the key

verse of the scripture lesson in
Joshua 24: “Choose you this day
whom ye will serve.”

Athletes M ay
Eat Together

“Athletes may training
table if they want one,” stated Nor-
man H. Shepard last week from the
office of the Athletic Director.

A training table, if the athletes
are favorable toward one, will be
independent of any
boarding house now operating in
Davidson and will be under the
control of the college.

It will be run on the club plan
for athletes alone, and consequent-
ly will be economical. At the same
time the athletes will be able to
get the kind of food that they want
and need. «i
The real suport the training

promote friendships, as well as to
build up team spirit and morale.
Other schools practice this exten-

The final decision as to whether
the athletes are to have a training
table or not will rest with the ath-
letes themselves.

Society Gives
Annual Party

The Eumanean Literary Society
went on a hayride to the Catawba
river for a marshmallow roast Tues-
day evening. ; ;

The group left at 7:15, in two
trucks accompanied by their dates.
On arriving at the Catawba river

a bonfire was made; and marsh-

mallows were roasted. After the
“roast” several members | of the
group told stories and the event

was closed by singing songs. Pro-
fessor and Mrs. W. G. McGavock

chaperoned the party. Approxi-
mately 25 couples went on the
party. This trip has been an an-
nual affair.

At the last meeting of the Society
held Tuesday, April 18, a short
story written by Ed Morrow was
read by George Lilly. After tis,
the Hall held a brief parliamen-
tary Session in which humorous
motions were brought up by the
floor, and were discussed by the

Senior Event

in Athletics and Have
Barbecue Supper

On Thursday, April 20, the first
of the annual Senior-Faculty field
held, featuring various
sporting events between the
groups, and climaxed by a barbe-
cue supper on the golf course.

A committee composed of Ovid
Bell, chairman; Shaw Smith, and
Oscar Armstrong, was in charge
of planning the event. Heath Whit-

days was

tle and Charlie Sample were in
charge of arranging the athletic
matches.

At 1:30 a bowling match was held
which the seniors won by 10 pins.
Also at this were the ten-
nis matches which the seniors won
3 to 2. At 3:30 was the softball
game which the seniors also won
by a score of 17 to 14. The faculty
were victorious in the golf match.

Then, at 6:00 the groups with-
drew to the golf course where
in horseshoes were held.
After this came the climax of the
day, a barbecue supper. After the
supper various skits in which s@a-
iors impersonated faculty members
were held around the campfire.

The president of the Senior Class,
Sam Newell, stated that the day

was successful in every way and
expressed a hope that the event
might become a Davidson tradi-
tion.

“America Confronts Possible

Last week at a meeting of Pi
Gamma Mu, Dr. P. H. Gwynn de-
the principal Dr.
who was introduced by
Frank Simmons, president of the
local chapter, chose as his subject
the topic: “America Confronts the
Possibility of a World War.”

Dr. Gwynn opened his discussion

In the second portion of his argu-
ment, Dr. Gwynn explained why
and how we were forced into the
last world conflict, and just how
we can check the power of these
factors today; namely by: giving
no credit to belligerents, keeping
American ships and citizens out of
war zones, letting the government
collect a surplus supply of goods
now which we can’t produce our-
selves in time of war, thus avoid-
ing a feeling of partisanship, and,
most important of all, to counteract
the flow of wartime propaganda.

Dr. Gwynn closed his speech by

held at the next meeting.

Faculty In Action

Pictured above we see two representative participants in the frolics at Davidson: last Thursday, when
the Seniors and Faculty entertained each other by sports, take-offs and a barbecue. On the left is Dr. W. P.
