overnance Operation Relies On Dean

By TOM BRUCE
Contributing Editor

Student conduct at Davidson
under the new trustees scheme
of regulations passed in June
1971 is entering Phase II.

The sweeping changes in the
channels that handle honor
violations and code of respon-
sibility infractions have been ef-
fective for one year. Sur-

prisingly. this first year has not
been much of a proving ground. |

The main areas of redesign
were in the establishment of a
Student Conduct Council (SCC)
and a_ restructuring of the
judiciary system.

The SCC was given jurisdic-
tion over admendments to the
Code of Responsibility. Where
once the taculty had a decisive
voice on changes in the code,
the new committee represents a
democratic membership com-
posed of administration, tacults
and students

The student) court) systems
were realigned to allow a wider

cused of violations. Where once

surrounded with secrecy and a

pyramid that made the Honor
Court value consistency above

Honor courts had to entorce
penalities that did not “tit: the
crime” simply because there
were no other penalities
availble: only outright con-
viction or outright acquittal.

“The new rules are a success
because they give the person
accused of an honor violation a
measure of choice.” explained
John M. Bevan, Vice President
for Academic Affairs.

student jury and have a

and at the same time provided
for a judgement in full context
with the situation.

“There are two things about
rules. First. if rules run counter
lo justice, we can change them.
Secondly. I don't believe in
having great catalogs of rules to
handle every conceivable
situation. Rules are only
guidelines; they don't reduce
the need for judgement.” said
Bevan.

Terry Discusses Structural Advantages
Of Governance Systems Modifications

By THOM NICOLL
Asst. Managing Editor

Possibly the key figure in the
new governance set-up, Dean ot
Students Will Terry. said Mon-
day that the new system is tunc-
tioning adequately and is
detinitely an improvement over
the old system.

Terry approved the in-
troduction of counselling direc-
tly into the governance system,
via his office. and pointed out

the new program’s structural
advantages.

“The old system = simply
ceased to tunction. The
procedures were extremely
complicated, and deciding
jurisdiction in a case often
created difficulties. The new
procedure. despite the length of
the document. is much = sim-
pler.”’

Terry noted that there has
been some discomtort ex-
pressed among some of the

Clay Praises New Governance,
Warns Of Dean's Importance

By THOM NICOLL
Asst. Managing Editor

Chairman of the Hearing
Committee Dick Clay said Mon-
day that the new governance
system “reads beautifully and.

on the balance. works
beautifully.”
Clay cited) = such im-

provements as more emphasis
on the defendant's rights and a
more orderly process. but he
also questioned aspects of the
plan.

“My specific criticism is that
this plan was written for a coun-
selling dean, such as we have.
rather than an ogre But what
happens i we get an ogre. im
stead”

“Ran Coble. the student bods
president when these revisions
came up told ome. “These
provisions were written with
Will Perry speenically i mind
as Dean of Students © But what
happens When we wet a lew

dean? Do we wrile a new
system for him?” Clay asked.

Clay pointed out that the new
system places much more
power in the dean's hands.

“In the past. all cases went
first to the chairman of the
Honor Court, who decided
whether they should be acted
on. Now thev go first to the
Dean of Students. This forces
Terry to make a lot of sub-
jective judgements.” Clay said.

Although Clay agreed that the
counselling aspect) of the
system is good. he noted that
under the old) system. coun
selling SUSSIONS were
sometimes prescribed us sanc
tions by the Honor Court

This Is supposed,

to sec how muah of a role the

play.

“Lf it turns out that the dean
dismisses too many cases. or if
the case load continues to be so
light that it leaves doubts in
minds as to the efficacy of the
system. then it will have to be
reconsidered,’ Clay said.

Clay said that now he has
hope for the plan and wants to
see it work as it is written.

“It any changes were to be
made."Clay said. *T would ad—
vocate Keepmg everything but
the option of choosing the dean
to handle the case. Most of the
provisions are excellent. Lf this
eplion were closed. the com-
mittee could) decide whether

Whether the dean should handle
the case”

Clay said that) governance
systems are not sacred and
should be ready changed a

should be given a chance to

“We have to have students, especially the Hearing
Committee, to remind students about the Honor Code,
and the success of the Code of Responsibility depends
completely on whether or not students choose to act

responsibly."

members of the Hearing Com-
mittee who were concerned that
students would no longer have a
major role in prosecution. He
disclaimed any intent 9 on
anyone's part to take away
from the students the authority
over student regulations.

However. Terry admitted
that the five or six who chose to
deal with him, as opposed to the
one who chose the courts, in-
dicate a lessened role for
students in prosecution ‘after
the fact.”

‘| have concern that students
never feel for any reason that
they do not have a stake in the
Honor System. We have to have
students. especially the
Hearing Committee. to remind
students about the Honor Code,
and the success of the Code of
Responsibility depends com-
pletely on whether or not
students choose to act respon-
sibly.” Terry said.

Terry also pointed to. the
necessity of the Hearing Com-
mittee in such cases as when a
delendent pleads innocent. or
when Terry) must disqualily

‘himself, because of a previous

counselling relationship, or if
his office were to get a bad
reputation in dealing out sanc-
tions to charged students

Terry said that he feels he has
been able to function in the dual
role ot counseHor-disciphnarian

“pretty well.” not having ex-
perienced any serious conflicts
between them thus far.

“The purpose of the whole
judicial system is primarily a
helping function. We're not here
to hang -people but to help
people. Secondly, we must
protect the community against
irresponsible people.” Terry
said.

Terry praised the students in-
volved in the system. “I have
always been impressed by the
conscientious efforts of the
Honor Court (Hearing Com-
mittee) to be completely fair to
the student, while remaining
cognizant of its responsibilities
to the community.”
