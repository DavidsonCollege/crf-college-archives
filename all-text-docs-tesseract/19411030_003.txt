Preyer is the President of the Vicks

industry. The Richardson brothers
both went to Davidson; Mr. L
Richardson was graduated in 1914,
while’ his brother, H: S. Richardson,
was a member of the class of ‘06.

Every Friday, a bundle contain-
ing 750 sample packages of Vick's
Cough Drops is mailed from Greens-
boro to George Mitchell, our cheer-
leader. This is not an advertise-
ment for the Vicks Chemical Com-|
pany, but yells do sound better af-
ter the half.

RUTLEDGE SPEAKS

Dr. Archibald Rutledge, not-
ed poet and scholar from South
Carolina, was the speaker at the
meeting of Sigma Upsilon Tues-
day night at the home of Dr. W.
P. Cumming.

The subject of Mr. Rutledge’s
talk was .“Writing for Publica-
tion”.. After the brief speech
the members of the literary fra-
ternity joined in an informal dis-
cussion during which Mr. Rut-
ledge answered numerous ques-
tions.
