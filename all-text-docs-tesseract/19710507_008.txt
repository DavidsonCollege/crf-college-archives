By CHARLIE TERRELL
Sports Writer

A windy day and inconsist-
ent play were two major rea-
sons for the fourth-place fin-
ish of the ‘Davidson golf team
in the Southern Conference
tournament, held recently at
Quail Ridge Golf Club in
Sanford.

The East Carolina Pirates
nipped defending champion
Furman 754 to 755 to cap-
ture team honors.

_ Following these schools
were The Citadel 783, David-
son 784, William and Mary
800, Richmond 828, and VMI
828,

Coach Tom Scott reflectéd
that his team should have
performed better.

“We were erratic in the
second round, and this hurt
us considerably. However,
East Carolina played very
well, turning in some good
scores,” he noted.

Freshman. Jim Ray was
the pace-setter for the Cats,
posting rounds of 73 and 78
for a 151 total. He finished in
a four-way tie for fifth place.

Ray echoed Scott’s disap-
pointment with ‘the team’s
finish. “‘I was pleased with
my first round, but the wind
was really bad ithe second
day and I didn’t putt well,
either,”’ he stated.

Ray praised the condition
of the Quail Ridge course,
and added that ‘East Caro-

‘Cats Take. Ninth
In Tufts Regatta

The Davidson College skip-
pers completed their season
last weekend by placing
ninth im a regatta held by
Tufts College in Boston.

The sailors took two crews,
~ the A crew captained by Jim
Hunter with Mark Leonard
and the B. crew captained
by ‘Al Lundy with Daryl
Douglas.

Concerning the regatta, Al
Lundy commented, ‘I think
we could have done a little
better, but we were racing
in a type of boat new to us
and we were up -against
some of the best schools in
the nation.’

The ‘interclub’’ boats rac-
ed at the regatta were differ-
ent in that “there is only one
sail, a main sail, instead of
a main and a jib,’’ Lundy
stated.

‘Lundy mentioned Harvard,
Rhode Island, and _ victor
M.I.T. as powerhouses in
sailing. Robbie Doyle, Har-

vard's A skipper, participat- |

ed in the 1968 Olympics in
Mexico.

In the five SAISA regattas
prior to the competition at
Tufts, the team finished first
once and second twice,

(May 22 and 23 Hunter and
Douglas will go to Milledge-
ville, Ga.to participate in
the regional competition for

boat.

lina just played super golf
in the wind.”’ «

The addition of a fall golf
season would be welcomed
by (Ray, who played on the
team at Tuscola High School
near Waynesville.

‘The competition would be

' better since players could

get their games together dur-
ing the summer,” he said.

. In a tie for eighth place
were Doug Clark and Rusty

Boyd with 154 shots each.

Clark turned in rounds of 76
and 78, while Boyd carded
two rounds of 77.

The erratic play lamented
by: Scott hindered the efforts
of Dick Spinner and Bill
Guerrant.

Spinner opened with a 77
but slipped to an 85 in the
windy second round for a 162
total. Guerrant was also
plagued by a second round
85, which coupled with his 78
on the opening day for a to-
tal of 163. :

Scott Sheftall, with an 81-
82-163 and Bill McKenzie,
who carded 83-83-166, were
other Wildcats competing in
the tournament.

Lynwood Edwards of The
Citadel edged Tommy Gaul
of Furman in an exciting
four-hole sudden death play-
off for the individual cham-
pionship. Both golfers had
144 totals for the regular
competition.

Defending champion David
Strawn of Furman, an East
Mecklenburg graduate, tied
for fourth place with Carl
Bell-of East’ Carolina at 150.

Looking to next year, Scott
noted that his team is youth-

ful but has difficulty with

practicing because of the

distance to Charlotte and
Denver. Ray also cited that
as a handicap.

“Charlotte has a_e great
course, but it takes a. big
chunk out of your day. to
drive in and back out,”’ he
indicated.

Scott predicted that top
contenders for the confer-
ence crown next year should |
be East Carolina and Fur-
man.

“Furman has its own cam-
pus golf course, which gives
them a definite advantage,”’
he concluded.

Our sign is Taurus, the Bull.

Can you handle us?

Tremendous strength, power, reliability, dependable good taste.
That's what Taurus is known for. Schlitz Malt Liquor, too.

Venus, the ruling planet, makes Taurus sociable, fond of fun, and
able to inspire friendship in others. Maybe you and the Bull should

get together. Maybe you’d hit it off.

But maybe not.

It depends on your sign. Because Taurus has a powerful mean streak.

There's a helluva fire in the Bull.

So check your stars. They'll tell you straight if you're the kind of
person who can meet Schlitz Malt Liquor head-on.

Nobody makes mait liquor like Schlitz. Nobody.
