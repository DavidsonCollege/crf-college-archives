THE DAVIDSONIAN, NOVEMBER 12, 1925

And Carolina has a multiplicity of
Dackfield stars and an array of reserve
material that surpasses that of any of
the other Tar Heel elevens.

May victory come to Wildcats.

Carolina has been pulling that trick
this year and has piled up a great record
following the early defeat by Wake For-
est.
