Wildcat volleyball readies for title defense

By MIKE: ANDERSON
Sports Writer

For the Wildcat volleyball team, last
season’s, magical campaign will prove diffi-
cult to forget.

But the key to success this fall, say
players and coaches alike, will be the ability
to do just that: Forget.

One year after soaring to national promi-
nence with a 31-4 record (including a flaw-
less 20-0 mark in Southern Conference play),
the Wildcats take to the hardwood this fall
with the highest of expectations.

_ Withahost of talent returning, Davidson
currently boasts a #48 ranking in the national
RPI as well as a top rating in the Southern
Conference pre-season coach’s poll.

Such pre-season hype could easily turn
the Friendly Confines of Belk Arena into a
veritable pressure-cooker. Yet the Wildcats
seems to be taking it all in stride.

“Last year was a great year, but we have
to remember that this is a completely differ-
ent season,” says senior Brooke Bentley.
“We have to take things one at a time. Com-
paring this season to last season isn’t smart
for us; things are so different.”

Fellow senior Mara Mordini echoed the .

sentiments. “We’re the team to beat, so
everyone is expecting alot out of us. But after
some discussion, we’ ve decided that we re-
ally need to take it slow and not jump out
ahead of ourselves. The Sele and the past
are irrelevant right now.’

The Schedule

Davidson’s rise in national prominence
has contributed to one of the most challeng-
ing schedules in program history.

In the month of September alone, the
Wildcats will take on three of the top four
teams in the ACC—Georgia Tech, Clemson,

claim the conference crown, three other pro-
grams earned first-place votes in the coaches’
poll: Chattanooga, Furman, and East Ten-
nessee State.

“Chattanooga and Western Carolina are
always a challenge,” says junior setter Erica
Schwartz. “But I honestly see Furman being.
a tough team this year; they improved so
much at the end of last season.”

and Wake Forest.

“I’m very excited about-our schedule,”
says first-year head coach Tami Darwin. “‘T
know this team would rather play tougher
opponents and be challenged than play a
weaker schedule.”

After a star-studded string of non-con-
ference games to open the season, the Wild-
cats will take to the task of defending their
Southern Conference title on September 12
against Wofford.

“This team is loaded with
talent,” says Darwin. “Not
only are the girls very athletic,
but they all have a solid knowl-
edge of the game. And they
just love playing together.
That’s my favorite thing about

this team: They love the game.”

The Wildcats will return five of their six
Starters this fall, including three pre-season
all-conference selections: -setter Erica
Schwartz and outside hitters Brooke Bentley
and Mara Mordini.

Mordini—last season’s SoCon Player of
the Year and tournament MVP—paced the
1999 Wildcats with 454 kills, 481 digs, and
42 service aces.

Bentley, a talented and unshakably-con-
sistent athlete, netted an impressive 3.64 digs

and 2.65 kills per game last season.

And Schwartz, who ascended to the start-
ing lineup when senior Ginny Quis went
down with an ankle injury, quickly emerged
as one of the conference’s most prolific set-
ters. Despite starting just over half of last
season’s games, Schwartz finished fourth in

the conference in assists during the regular .

season and set a Southern Conference Tour-
nament record with 84 assists.

Seniors Katherine Lorenz and Lauren
Schultz will complement Mordiniand Bentley
with vast experience and leadership—Lorenz
led all Wildcats in games played last season.

The Rookies

Two new
freshmen join the
Wildcat squad this
fall—setter Nicole
Tonelli  and-
middle blocker
Tisha Chapman.

Tonelli, a
highly touted set-
ter from New
Lenox, Ill., will
play understudy to
Schwartz this sea-
son and figures to
play a,major role
in the Wildcats’
future.

“Nicole has come from a high level’club
volleyball team, so she’s come in right away
and done a great job,” says Darwin. “She’s
quickly adapting to our style of offense and
she’s pushing herself every day.”

Fellow freshman Tisha Chapman is no
stranger to success either. A three-year high
school MVP, Chapman guided nearby Free-
dom High School to a flawless 25-0 record.

“Tisha is a phenomenal athlete,” says
Darwin. “She has had some flashes of bril-
liance, and it’s scary what she can do. She’s
going to be a weapon.”

Up Next

Davidson opens up regular season play
at home on Friday afternoon against Georgia
Tech before heading into Wildcat Classic

Georgia State. -

The Yellow Jackets are the second-rated
team in the ACC and offer the Wildcats a

“The first step is getting the recognition
we’ veeamed,” acknowledged Schwartz. “But
the big thing is living up to it.”
