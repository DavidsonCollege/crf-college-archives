Northern Illinois University
DEKALB, III.(CPS) - Northern
Illinois University’s health center
distributed 35,000 condoms to be
judged by students for “appear-
ance, sensualness/comfort, smell,
taste, lubrication and sense of se-
curity,” but not everyone was
pleased by The Great Condom
Rating Contest.

Health officials said the Feb.
22-26 event was supposed to pro-
mote safe sex and AIDS aware-
ness. But the critics said it simply
promoted behavior that spreads
disease and charged that the con-
test literature may have misrepre-
sented the condom failure among
college-age users.

The free condom packages
distributed by the Health Services

ent brands and types packed with a
questionnaire and a folder on the
proper-use of condoms.

“We copied the idea directly

_ from Stanford,” said contest coor-

dinator Michael Haines of Health
Services. “The contest provides
feedback so we can find out stu-
dent preferencgs, while we give
them educational] materials discuss-
ing risks.”

Haines said that free condoms,
paid for by ‘student health fees,
have been available for the past
five years. Students can find them
in fishbowls at health centers,
Greek halls, and residence halls.

“The contest helps us find out
which condoms students prefer,
which helps us ensure greater us-
age,” Haines said.

Government Suspended
TUSCALOOSA, Ala.(CPS) -The
Student Government Association
at the University of Alabama was
suspended by the administration
after a female candidate was at-
tacked in her home.

The attack, combined with the
political influence of a secretive
student group run by. the
university’s 27 fraternities and so-
rorities, forced officials to suspend
elections and close down the SGA
until “such time as our students
can be assured: that the methods
and procedures for electing a Stu-
dent Government Association are
free, fair and open,” President
Roger Sayers said in a statement.

Minda Riley, a junior and a
candidate for an SGA seat, was hit

her home on January 31, said uni-
versity spokesman Keith Ayers. A
cross was burned in her front yard
in November, officials said. Riley
is white.

On February 1, Sayers, on the
recommendation of Vice President
Harry Knopke, suspended the Feb-
ruary 10election and the SGA.
The SGA fiinctions are now under
the university president’s office.

Harvard Students Enjoy
Gourmet Fare
CAMBRIDGE, Mass.(CPS) -
Harvard University students can
enjoy gourmet meals from fine res-
taurants this spring - without ever

leaving campus. |
Under Dining Services’ new
“visiting chefs” program, execu-

area restaurants will plan and over-
see one dinner in a designated
dining hall, The Harvard Gazette
reported.

The series of dinners will be-
gin March 23, and students must
make reservations for each meal.

. Michael Berry, director of
Dining Services, cooked up the
visiting chefs program after read-
ing an April Fools’ issue of The
Harvard Crimson shortly after he
arrived on campus two years ago.

The spoof announced that
Berry had hired a celebrated Los
Angeles restaurateur to plan din-
ing hall meals. “I walked into my
office (the day the paper came
out), and people on my staff were
all upset,” Berry said. “But I
thought , “That is a clever idea.””

Coed House Hopes to Offer Alternative on Patterson Court
New Members Hope to Create a House That Stresses Individuality Instead of Typical Conformity

By Heather Flint &
Paul Tong

Students on campus are orga-
nizing acoed eating house for next
semester and we want to share our
goals for the house with the
Davidson community. First of all,
we want to create a house where
menand women can be together in
order to foster healthy relation-
ships between the sexes and im-
prove male/female relations.

We want tocreate a house that
will provide a social setting for its
members, a place to hang out after
class where you will be assured of
running into your friends.

We want to create ahouse that
stresses individuality instead of
conformity, a house where any-
body can feel welcome and free to
be oneself. Because of the nature
of coed eating houses, we want to
stress the fact that we will be non-
discriminatory. Anyone is wel-

come to join.
Another important reason for
this house is food - good food.

‘ We’ve.come up with many ideas

for our menu, ranging from ethnic
foods to Mom’s Recipe Night
where each member contributes a
favorite recipe from home to be
cooked on a designated night. We

_ also want to provide nutritious and

palatable meal options for vegetar-
ians. :

We realize that seniors may
want to eat some meals in their
apartments and that other students
might wanttocontinue eating some
meals at the Commons. In order to

accommodate those students we _

are hoping to offer meal plan flex-
ibility where members can con-
tract to eat only certain meals atthe
house. We also intend to serve
meals on the weekends.

We will have additional
money for better meal service from

our preliminary decision to be a
dry house. Alcohol will be limited
toB.Y.Ostatus. We wishto do this
for many reasons. First of all, we
want the focus of our parties to be
friends and fun, not alcohol. We
want to create an atmosphere con-
ducive to conversation. We also
don’t want to force non-drinking
members of our house to pay for
alcohol they don’t consume. As
far as the decision to drink, the cost
and responsibility will lay with the
individual.

We wantto keep our house in
good condition so that it will be a
place where we enjoy being,
whether it be for studying, eating,
or socializing. We want this house
to be yourhome-away-from-home.

Besides providing money for
better meals, by not using house
money for alcohol and paying for
an expensive liquor license we will
have more money for our social

activities. That means we will
have more money for house-spon-
sored trips, activities, and pur-
chases for our house.

Another idea we have is to
create an environmental house, a
house that uses real dinnerware,
not disposable dishes and cups.
We recognize that the plastic cups
used at parties on campus are an
environmental nightmare and we
intend to use only paper cups - no
plastic or styrofoam - when mem-
bers don’t bring cups of their own.
We want to be the forerunner in
environmentalism on Patterson
Court.

We really want this house to
work and hope the student body at
Davidson supports us in this en-
deavor.

We cannot stop drinking or
loving the preferred gender, To try
and do so would be ridiculous.
Davidson needs a place for men

t

and women to meet and talk. A
place where healthy relationships
and responsible drinking are ac-
tively encouraged. But where is
this place? :

Although it does not yet exist,
a new coed house is in the early
stages of formation. Currently, the
house has no charter and no state-
ment of purpose.

The house doesn’t even have
any members. You, however, have.
a chance to discuss what a new
house should be, what. its goals
should aspire towards, and to join
others in the pursuit of equality
and fun. _

The organizational meeting
for anew coed house will be in the
UNION OUTPOST beginning at
7:00 PM, Wednesday, the 10th.
Faculty, students, and staff are en-
couraged to join in the planning.
Refreshments provided.
