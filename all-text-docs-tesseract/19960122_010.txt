One Hall’s Odyssey

A veteran reminisces

Like that magic moment before your first kiss,
your first experiment with a razor, your initial
reaction to a returned review, Self-Selection night
ranks right up there as a rite of passage. Like
countless men before them, and doubtless many to
follow, the men of Second West Belk — a.k.a
“ClubWest” — underwent the baptism of fire with
a little wariness and much anticipation.

For the Residence Life staff, too, it would not
bea night to be forgotten. “Ireally don’t remember,
last night,” groaned a visiting Matt “Mean Dean”
Pearson, Hall Counselor to the freshmen of Second
Little. Clyde Jason Wright, whose flock is Second
West, remarked, “The guys really impressed me

As atwo year veteran of Self-Selection night,
I finally got it right. When the screaming began
and everyone began to cock theirchampagne bottles
towards the door, three friends and I ran down to
the basement.

Some might say that I missed out on the fun,
but it sure was nice to be dry. That way I didn’t have
to run up the hill soaking, sticky, absolutely un-
bearably freezing, take a shower and change.

I sometimes try to explain the Self-Selection
phenomenon to friends from home, and they usu-
ally look at me with disbelief. “Yeah,” I say, “we
all spray each other with champagne and chug the
rest, all the while running from one end of the

Movie Review

Heat registers lukewarm

By Ep ACLE
Movie Critic

Two of my favorite film ac-
tors working today are Al Pacino
and Robert DeNiro. They both
broke into the film scene at virtu-
ally the same time — the early
1970s. The film that really cata-
pulted the twointoearly stardom
was the second installment of The
Godfather trilogy.

After considering these facts
(as well as their penchant for tak-
ing on similar roles), one would
have expected them to have acted
together in quite a few films. This

is not the case. Heat, a 1995 re-
lease directed by Michael Mann,
provides DeNiro and Pacino with
their first opportunity to act oppo-
site one another. Ultimately, this
opportunity is what makes Heat
worth seeing.

Michael Mann directed this
film, as becomes clear from the
very beginning. Mann isastylistic
virtuoso known for his work onthe
early years of Miami Vice as well
as the underrated Manhunter. One
of the themes of Mann’s work has
always been the identification the
police detective is forced to make
with the criminal

Only by thinking like the bad
guy, and at extreme moments even
adapting his methods, can the de-
tective ever hope to bring the
wrong-doer to justice.

This theme is once more at
work in Heat. It’s a basic plot:
Pacino the cop has to catch DeNiro
the crook. The men are similar in
some ways — they both have
trouble connecting with love,
they’re both loyal friends to their
respective teams of criminals and
detectives, they both are fueled by
inner fire to be the best that they
can in their chosen professions. In
one of the two scenes where they

meet, in a coffee shop, this be-
comes quite apparent.

When watching these two ac-
tors talk to each other one becomes
aware that the audience is basi-
cally looking at two sides of the

. Same coin — as they say in so

many words. As they act, DeNiro
and Pacino almost seem to be aware
of the audience looking at them,
almost seem to be saying, “You
wanted it, you gotit. The two of us
are finally in.a scene together, and
we’re just as similar as everyone
always thought we were.” It’s
powerful. The rest of the film isn’t
quite so good. Mann is a stylistic

director, but his vision does not
seem anywhere near as fresh as it
did 10 years ago. The film abounds
in unnecessary sub-plots which
drag it down. These other sub-
plots leave the film just a few min-
utes shy of three hours, an almost
disastrous length for a film that
relies on quick pacing.

At the heart of the film, how-
ever, remain the two old pros.
Pacino and DeNiro rip into their
roles, each determined to not let
the other walk away with the film.
It is a conflict even more interest-
ing than the story on screen, and
ultimately it’s what carries Heat.
(Rating: B)
