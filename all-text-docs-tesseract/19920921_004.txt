the lower sections of their class.
The remaining 20 are in the middle
range of their class. Tapia targets
these students because they are
“diamonds in the rough”; each has
potential, though it may be un-
tapped.

To unearth these students’
promise, the program focuses on
the person as a whole, not just as a
student. They attend summer
classes in math, English and sci-
ence.

Spiritual/Leadership classes
attempt to give students an idea of,
as Tapia constantly reminds them,
“who they are and whose they are.”
The program also encompasses a
physical fitness program in an ef-
fort to get them hooked on health.

But LOL does not end in Au-
gust. Students attend workshops
and activities throughoutthe school
year to reinforce study skills, to
coach them through the college
application process, to develop
Spiritually.

Their parents must attend
workshops, also, on topics ranging
from dealing with CMS to han-
dling questions on AIDS.

This holistic program has met
with considerable success. The
firstclass toreap the benefits of the
full five years graduated from high
school in June, and 29 out of 30
now attend college. A younger
student remarked that her grades
had improved from D’s to B’s.

Tapia herself notes a North
Meck senior in the program as an

inspiration. Originally forced by
his mother to apply to the program,
apreviously quiet, withdrawn boy
nowasahigh school seniorrambles
excitedly of attending college and
pursuing education. To have in-
stilled in him a genuine love of
learning inspires Tapia and Miller
to continue the program.

The Davidsonianrecently had
achance to talk with Brenda Tapia.
Below are excerpts from that in-

GREEKS & CLUBS

terview.

Davidsonian: You mentioned
once last year that you would
like to take a group of Love of
Learning students to a third
world country. Why?

Tapia: That thought came to me
when we started experiencing some
of the behavior problems and atti-
tudes that are common in Char-
lotte-Mecklenburg schools. I real-
ized that I’m dealing with kids
who don’t have the background or
the history I have in terms of un-
derstanding and seeing what has
happened for and with African-
American people and are not as
conscious of the debt that they
have to pay to the people on whose
backs we have crawled to come
this far. Taking them to a third
world country might make them
realize that where they see stu-
dents who don’t have a pencil not
because they forgot or didn’t care,
as our students will, but because
there aren’t any pencils. But yet
they’re willing and eager to learn.
I somehow wanted to help them to
see reality because I think chil-
dren, especially white and black in
the South, don’ trealize how blessed
they are. I noticed that in the
inquiries as a result of the Kuralt
show, the majority of them have
come from Northern cities, inner
cities. Parents are calling trying to
get their children in this program
because what their children are
having to deal with in public and

‘private schools in the North is so

much more devastating than what

our students are dealing with here.
When you have to worry whether

or not you will physically make it
to yournextclass. When you have
to dodge bullets to get to class.
When you have teachers who have
given up and no longer care about
whether or not you learn. When
you are dealing with a situation
where the resources and books are
outdated and not adequate. When
all of that has trickled down and
the students are having to learn in

those types of environments, natu-
rally parents would love to get
their kids in a program where the
Student is important. I look at the
students this way and encourage
my staff to look at students this
way: that being, we don’t know
who these students are. Some
young boy or girl in one of our
classes might be the scientist who
has the cure for AIDS. You don’t
know who these kids are and what
they will be capable of doing. I
feel like many of the problems that
we’re confronted with as a society
rightnow, thesolutions to themare
somewhere strung out on drugs,
behind bars or lying in the gutters
in the street. Are we going to lose
a whole generation or generations
in this manner?

Davidsonian: Charlotte-
Mecklenburg Schools are also
having similar problems as you
mentioned with lack of books
and teachers. Do you think Love
of Learning helps counter these?

Tapia: I think that Love of Learn-
ing does. Unfortunately because
we’re small, I feel like our effort is
like one attempting to empty the
ocean with a thimble.

Davidsonian: How do you keep
the students’ goals realstic and
attainable?

Tapia: First of all, I think that
really comes out in the Leader-
ship/Spiritual (classes). In the
Leadership we try to help the stu-
dents to go within and to identify

their particular gifts and talents.

We don’t give out grades. At the
end of every summer program ev-
ery teacher sits down with students
and tells them their individual
strengths and stumbling blocks. I
think that’s one of the major ways
we help students to stay within the
boundaries of realities for their
particular gifts and talents. The
other thing is to point out their
uniqueness. I constantly tell stu-
dents that wecan realize the unique-

ness of silver and gold because it’s
not plentiful. I try to help students
realize that they are unique. God
did not create them to be anything
but themselves. God created
Michael Jordan to be Michael Jor-
dan, butGod created you to be you.
And in God’s eyes, the only eyes
that are important, you are as im-
portant and special as Michael. So
it’s your responsibility to fulfill
your destination, to find out what
exactly what it is you have been
created to be and to be the best at
being you.

Davidsonian: How do you envi-
sion Love of Learning in the fu-
ture?

Tapia: The future that I see for
Love of Learning is LoveofLeam-
ing satellites or similar programs
across North Carolina and this na-
tion. But I also see the program
being not just for African-Ameri-
cans because one of my goals from
the beginning was to work with all
children. I think the way we’re
educating young people, white,
black, red, brown and yellow, in
this country is totally wrong, and I
think we have to take a more holis-
tic approach.

Davidsonian: How can the
Davidson College Community
help Love of Learning?

Tapia: There are several ways I
feel the Davidson College Com-
munity can be supportive of Love
of Learning. First of all, praying
for the program. I think we could
change a lot of things in life if we
were but to be still, turn within and
go to God in prayer about it. Sec-
ondly, by attempting to be in-
volved and participating in the pro-
gram in whatever ways they can:
helping out in the office since we

. don’t have the staff we always

need, being available to be tutors
for the students, developing rela-
tionships. If some of them would
adopt Love of Learning students,

be big sisters/big brothers to stu-
dents, share who they are with the
students. One of the things I’ve
seen with the interaction of coun-
selor-mentors with Love of Learn-
ing students has been the fact that
they have only been a few years
older than these students, and when
they talk about what a student
should be doing in high school and
how they should be preparing for:
college, it has a lot more impact
than someone who is thirty years
older than most of them. And last

but not least, spreading the word.

We have students here from all
over the country. I’m sure there
are things Davidson College stu-
dents can do to help promote pro-
grams of this nature.

Davidsonian: On a more per-
sonal note, being Director of Love
of Learning, acting chaplain and
“mother” to a number of stu-
dents must be difficult. How do
you handle all of these roles?

Tapia: I pray a lot. This has been
a rewarding and growth-produc-
ing experience being on
Davidson’s €ampus. To be truth-
ful I had forgotten I was anything
but a woman until I came here.
Davidson has really putme in touch
with the double crosses that I bear
being black and female. Anytime
you seek to give and to do for
others, you always receive more
yourself,

The SCC, however, had in-
tended that the additional 12 mem-
bers elected this Fall come from
the sophomore and junior classes
only. There was widespread mis-
understanding about this decision,
however, and many seniors had
been told that they would have the
opportunity torun. To accomodate
these Seniors the SGA decided to
split the additional 12 position
evenly among the three classes.
