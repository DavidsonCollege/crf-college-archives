The DAVIDSONIAN

Vol. IV.

Class Basketball
Will Begin Friday

Close and interesting Series Prom-
ised--A Complete Schedule.

The fall season for basketball, which
hegins this week, bids fair to be one of
the most interesting series ever played
here. The consistent practice of each
of the teams seems.to indicate that each
class will put out a strong quintette.

The season will open Friday, October
13th, with a game between the Fresh
and Juniors. The game will no doubt
be one of great interest as it will be a
try-out of much new material against
the champions for the past two years.
The season's schedule follows:

October 1 3th—Junior-Fresh.

October 16th—Senior-Soph.

October 20th—F resh-Senior.

October 23rd—Soph- Junior.

October 27th—Senior- Junior.

FRESHMEN LECTURE
DELIVERED BY KEESLER

The regular semi-monthly lecture to
Freshmen was civen last Friday morn-
ing by S. R. Keesler, ‘17. President of
the Student Body.

In his subject, “Our Honor System.”
Keesler explained the meaning of the
word “honor.” and how it hehooved
not only every Freshman, but every stu-
dent, to have his honor stainless and
above reproach. He impressed the fact
that cheating on review, recitation or
examination was no less than theft and
the worst crime that could be committed
by a student of Davidson, one that would
cause expulsion sooner than anvthing else.

Some of the evils of gambline were
analyzed. No student should lock
himself and some of his fellow-students
in his room and gamble awav the hard-
earned money given him to get an edu-
cation.

The Freshmen were also warned not
to provoke hazing, to respect an upper-
classman and be respected by him, not
to leave the Hill without permission,
and not to deface or destroy college
property, for Davidson is not a prep
school, and cannot stand for such mis-
deeds,

The speaker closed by saying that
Davidson was one of the few colleges
thar have an honor system supported
entirely by the students, and urged the
men to put their shoulders to the wheel
and. uphold this system.

ORCHESTRA AND GLEE
CLUB TO MAKE TRIP

The Orchestra and Glee Club are
preparing to make a trip to Winston
about October 2tst. Later, probably
in November. a trip will be made to
Greensboro, Raleigh. Wilmington and
Red Springs. As it is still rather early
in the season, the men who will make
the Orchestra and Glee Club have not
been definitely named, altho the pros-
pects for this vear are very bright.

Davidson outfought and outplayed
their heavier A. & M. rivals at every
stage of the football game at Charlotte
Saturday and won by the decisive score
of 16 to 0.

‘The advance dope which was in taver
of A. & M. on account of their superior
weight and the presence of old stars of
All-Southern fame in their line-up. was
seriously upset from the start by the
wonderful concentrated offensive and
defensive play of the whole Davidson
team. It was a hatd fought. well de-
served, and clean-cut victory for Dav-
idson, and evens up many old ‘scores.
The Red and Black squad showed the
results of superior coaching and thru-
out the entire forty minutes of play their
“pep” and fight kept up steadily.

A. & M. was kept on the defensive
thruout the entire game. ‘Vheir backs,
led by Van Brocklin, time after time

battered at the Davidson line and at-
tempted to circle the ends, but the line
held and not once were they able to get
outside the Davidson ends. A. & M.
only succeeded in) making first down
three times in the course of the game,
and two of these came in the second quar-
ter. They frequently resorted to punts,
but were bested almost two to one by
the superb punting of Flowers. Van
Brocklin was easily the star of the A.
& M. team, getting in almost every
play and bearing the brunt of both the
offensive and defensive work of _ his
team. Baughan and Rice also plaved
well in the A. & M. backfield, while
Cooke. in the line, was the only one
who seemed to be able to pierce the Red
and Black offense.

The Davidson team worked in top
form individually and collectively, but
to “Sam” Keesler must he given the
credit of being the particular star. He
ran the team like a general and was

A. & M. Defeated By Davidson |
In Fine Contest Saturday

Red and Black Puts Up Great Game In Every Department, Bumbling
the Aggies 16 - 0.

Davidson's most consistent ground gain-
er. He reeled off something over a
hundred yards in scrimmage and return-
ed A. & M.'s punts for a total of 116
vards. “The lightest man on the team,
he proved nearly as successful on tine
bucks as in circling the ends.

Flowers was also a large factor in his
team’s victory, playing like a- veteran.
He contributed the first: score in the na-
ture of a prety drop kick trom the 3o-
yard line, and his) punts. which were
high and twisting, averaged nearly 50
yards, “Steve Walker. ins his) dual
capacity of end and half-back, plaved
especially well at half-back, never fail-
ing to gain when called upon. He was
paired with his brother “Bob" on de-
fensive, and neither allowed anyone to
get around them. “Jack” Black and
“Buck” Burns, next to Keesler, were
Davidson's mast consistent — offensive
factors. Each contributed a touchdown
to the score. Burns and Captain. White
backed up the dine especiall well. In
the line, while each man fought hard
and plaved aggressively, the work of
“Billv’ Savad was an especial feature.
He was a tower of strength hoth on
offensive and defense.  Spahn and
Crouch, whe were substituted in’ the
backfield during the last few minutes of
play, made a good showing, and were
steadily carrying the ball towards A.
& M.S goal when the whistle blew.
