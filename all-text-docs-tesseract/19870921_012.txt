Who will be the most valuable
player in the National League this
year? How about the American
League? Many names come im-
mediately to mind when analyzing
these questions. In the NL, Jack
Clark, Andre Dawson, Eric
Davis, Tim Wallach and others
leap to the forefront. In the junior
circuit, George Bell, Dwight
Evans, Mark McGwire, and Alan
Trammell all stand out. However,
before one can choose an MVP,
one must examine all the creden-
tials a player needs to be consid-
ered for the award. Which is the
number one consideration for
most valuable player — great in-

dividual statistics or leading a-

team into contention or to a cham-
pionship? Before discussing indi-
vidual players, let’s take a look at
what the voting should be based
on.
"The first question has already
been asked — should the MVP

be a great player on a great team,

or one who has an exceptional in-
dividual year but is on a: mediocre
or poor team? Naturally, home
run titles, batting titles, and RBI
crowns carry weight with the vot-
ers, but a player who contributes
heavily to a contending team
merits much attention, too. For
the purposes of this article, win-
ning and team success are major
points in determining the most
valuable player. After all, win-
ning is the name of the game, anda
player. who helps his team be suc-
cessful, not neccessarily taking
the whole enchilada, gets more
kudos than the statistical giant in
this writer’s mind.

Another issue raised by the
MVP vote is whether or not pitch-
ers should be eligible. Obviously,
the Baseball Writers Association
of America feels that they should,
as they elected Boston’s Roger
Clemens American League MVP
in 1986. Granted, he had an awe-
‘some year, but does he deserve
consideration when he plays only

every fifth day? A relief pitcher is
perhaps more of an everyday con-
tributor, but a great one like Cle-
mens can glue an entire pitching
staff together. This debate will
continue, perhaps interminably,
but in 1987 speculators need not
agonize on this angle of the issue;
there are no pitchers in either
league worthy of claiming the
award.

Now, let’s examine the candi-
dates.

The national league

The three top candidates here
are Jack Clark of St. Louis, Eric
Davis of Cincinatti, and Andre
Dawson of the Cubs. At this time,
they have to be considered the fa-

vorites. Others who will make an

impact on the voting are Tim Wal-
lach of Montreal, Will Clark of
the Giants, Tony Gwynn of San
Diego, and Tim Raines of
Montreal. _
Jack Clark

A great player on a winning
team, no. question. Without this
tremendous threat in the middle of
their lineup, the Cardinals might
encounter some serious problems,
even with all their speed. Clark. is
a destructive force. he is con-
stantly pitched around, and is
rarely challenged, but his num-
bers are excellent. At this writing,
Clark is fourth in home runs with
35, third in RBI’s with 106, eighth
in runs with 93,. second in slug-
ging PCT, and first in on base
PCT, walks, and game winning

hits. He is the heart of the St.

Louis lineup and his very pre-
scence is a distraction to any op-
posing pitcher.
Eric Davis

The next Willie Mays? It is far
too early to tell, but Davis ‘is one
helluva baliplayer. At the start of
the season, he looked like a shoo-
in for the award. He was player-
of-the-month for both April and

May and was off to a tremendous

start. His 36 home runs place him:
third in the league, he’s first in
runs and slugging, as well as plac-

“Let us be your connection to great Pizza!

892 - 9046

ing high on the list for walks, on-
base PCT., stolen bases, and
_RBI’s. The Reds have been shut
out only 4 times the entire year
and “e” was not in the lineup for 3
of those. The Reds average 2 less
runs per game without Davis in
the batting order. The vital cog in
the big red machine, Davis blends
speed and power into an over-
whelming talent.
Andre Dawson

Dawson is the statistical giant
of the NL this year. He has slam-
med 43 homers, and driven in 117
runs, both tops in the league. He’s
also fourth in slugging and second

in game winning hits. “Andre —

Awesome” has been a tough out
all year, and he is a dangerous
man to have at the plate in any
situation. The one snare in his
quest for MVP is the Cubs. They
are only mediocre, and despite his
fantastic season, this hurts Daw-
son’s chances for MVP.
The Longshots
Tim Wallach

He has quietly put together a
super season. Montreal is making
waves in the NL East, and this
helps his slim chances. he’s eighth
in batting, second in RBI’s, and
the leader in doubles.

Will Clark

This rising star has helped San
Francisco into contention in the
west with his potent bat and,glove.

+ Tony Gwynn

Gwynn is a top player who

leads in average, hits, and runs.
Tim Raines

Raines is a superstar who has
had much to do with Montreal’s
success. Despite no spring train-
ing, he has come on to have a sen-
sational year.

The American League
Over in the AL, the four
names that stand out from a pack
of fine ballplayers are Alan Tram-
mell of Detroit, Dwight Evans of
Boston, George Bell of Toronto,
and Wade Boggs of Boston.

‘Who's the most valuable player?

Alan Trammell
“Tram” has been Detroit’s
leader throughout a season in
which many thought the Tigers
would not be a factor. He’s played
hurt, been a clutch hitter, and his
stats are among the league lead-

ers. At one point, Trammell went:

10 weeks without being called out
on strikes.. Things happen when
the ball is put in play, and Tram-
mell has done that to the tune of a
.328 average, fourth in the league.
Aclass act on a solid team.
Dwight Evans
Evans has put it all together this
_year with outstanding statistics.
He is in the top 8 of 8 major statis-
tical categories, igcluding third in
homers (33), and second in RBI’s
(112). This season marks the
seventh consecutive year that
evans has reached the 20 homer
plateau. and at .320, he has not
sacrificed anything for power pro-
duction.
George Bell -

Bell is one of the top baseball
talents in either league, and he is
putting on quite a show this year.
His 45 home runs and 122 runs
batted in are number one in both
circuits. Toronto is in a dogfight
for the al east, and bell has been
their main man. He is in the top 15
of 7 major categories and he plays
with an admirable intensity and
fire.

Wade Boggs

“Baseball’s next .400 hitter”
never seems to get the recognition
that he deserves, but perhaps this
is the year. In addition to pacing
the league with a .367 average, he
also leads in runs, on base pct.,
hits doubles and walks. He also
has added the dimension of power
to his game but blasting 23 homers
and knocking in over 80 runs.
alas, he and teammate Dwight
Evans are hurt by the Boston’s
lack of ability to win.

The Longshots
Mark McGwire

A great impact player, despite

the fact that he has slowed down

1987 THE DAVIDSONIAN

since the all-star break. He’s
helped the athletics, but he will
have to “settle” for the rookie
home run record and rookie of the
year.

Don Mattingly

Any discussion of MVPis
Mattingly territory, but this year
he is simply not as devastating as
usual.

Kent Hrbek and Kirby Puckett

This pair has helped a good
Minnesota team all year, but in the
long run they do not have the num-
bers.

The MVP's

In the NL, MVPis an ex-
tremely difficult choice. Jack
Clark, Davis, and Dawson are all
candidates who would cakewalk
to the award in a normal year.
Dawson is incredible, Davis is
electrifying, but if the season
ended today the NL MVP would
have to be Jack Clark. He is virtu-
ally unstoppable, even when he is
pitched around, and his 136 walks
show that no one wants to pitch to
him. His very presence in the
lineup gives the cardinals a great
boost.

Dwight Evans is having a
spectacular year, doing it all for
the Red Sox, and Wade Boggs
seems to be an impossible out. Yet
the Bosox’s losing record hurts
both of their chances. Trammell is
a great player on a quality team
and he is indeed having a superb
year. However, George Bell. of
Toronto is the choice in the AL.
He, like Jack Clark, is a pre-
scence, a force to be reckoned ©
with, whether he is hot or cold. He
is tearing the league apart and
leading the Blue Jays into the
thick of the pennant fight.

Winning is the bottom line in
baseball, and both Clark and Bell
are great players on great teams.
Their contributions have been in-
valuable to their clubs in the race
for the pennant. Therefore, at this
writing, Clark and Bell should be

‘lected MVP’s in their respective
agues.
