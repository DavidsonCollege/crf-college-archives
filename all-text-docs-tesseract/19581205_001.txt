Davidsonian Staff Writer
The newly organized elec-

tions committee, with the
primary objective of re-
vamping Davidson's present
inefficient and inadequate
system of elections, has dis-
cussed several needed al-
terations during its first
two meetings.

one favored no cuts at all. Two
professors wanted still a dif-

were for them only for stu-

age; four for members of cer-

Another who checked 6.b

absurd in principle, and even
all possible amendments and
reservations must lead in-
evitably to abuses and in-
equalities. Students should
not be penalized for absences
from courses in which they
are doing outstanding work;
nor should they be permitted
any unexcused absences from
a course in which they are not
keeping up with the rest of
the class.”

The primary concern has cen-

it takes to complete the elec-

Anderson also commented
that he would personally sup

were even small charges for

amounts.

in order to reduce the ac-
counting complications and to
provide adequate and equita-
ble financial support, the gen-
eral fee was introduced. Its
function was to provide funds
for those items which had
been previously covered by
special fees.

During the 1957-1958 school
year, approximately $85,000 was
received from this income
source. The only specific ex-
penditures from this income
were for those organizations
which keep their own accounts.

These were the student activi-
ties (the publications, the Artist

Series, the Red and Black Mas-
quers, Forensic, and the student '
body). The total expenditures of
these organizations was $18,537.
which was broken down as in'
the chart below.

At first glance there seems
to be a wide disparity in
funds between such similar
publications as the annual and
the magazine. However, at
closer inspection, it is cleor
that the annual must have
more money than the maga-
zine. Current prices of photo-
graphs are one dollar each
(except, of course, class pic-
tures). In addition the costs
of engraving are high. Be-
sides these expenses, the an-
nual is far larger than the
magazine.

As for the rest of the income
from the general fee, it. is in-'
distinguishable from the in-
come listed under tuition. The!
temainder of the general fee is
put on the credit side of the
account along with income re-
ceived from tuition, gifts, in-

A sum of $1,829,812 has
been pledged or given to
Davidson College’s long-

ment Plan, Robert J. Sail-

The Ten-Vear Development
Plan is a program designed
to provide facilities for the
growth of Davidson College
over the period 1957 to 1967.
These facilities include addi-
tions to the college plant, in-

| creases in faculty salaries, in-

creases in the endowment and
scholarship programs. and im-
provements in the scholastic
curriculum.

‘Sailstad emphasized that the
growth of the college will be
due largely to the trustee’s de-

enrotiment to 1,000, and that
the Development Plan is de-
signed to meet the requirements
of the enlarged student body.

included in the $1,829,812
already contributed are $60,
000 in cash gifts for a Fine

Arts Building and a $400,000
gift by Mr. Charles A. Dana
for a new science building
and  130-room dormitory.
Ground was broken for the
“Dana Science Laboratory in
October, and plans for the
new dormitory are now being
drawn.

Approximately half of the
present sum of $1,829,812 has
gone into endowments for
faculty salaries, student schol-
arship, and the instructional
program, Mr. Sailstad said. The
