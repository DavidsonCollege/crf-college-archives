and that they needed to go down to

see what happened exactly.
Campus police thought it was

just a leak from a hole that needed

tobe patched up; however, Cashion
found that the pipe line had burst in

the next morning.

The campus police were on
the scene as well, to make sure
everything went smoothly. Many
students of Belk chose to watch the
action from the windows above.

When asked to comment,

ing in his official capacity at the
college, he has had to deal with
pipe bursts only one or two other
times. He commented that what
happened to the pipe line to Belk
was a result of age and deteriora-
tion.

Freshwomen can cluster in eating houses

By Carrie Blackburn

As students look forward to a
much needed break, freshwomen
also struggle with the decision of
choosing an eating house or re-
maining independent.

This year self selection in-
cludes some important distinctions.
The option of clustering has been
implemented to insure that
freshwomen do not get placed ina
house without their friends.

Up to 4 women may cluster
and as a group receive 1 lottery
number. A cluster has no bearing
on their chances, but if their first
choice is full then the whole clus-
ter is placed in their 2nd or 3rd
choice.

Freshwomen may still opt to
goalone or not to join at all, but this
way the disappointment of not get-
ting their first choice will not be
coupled with not being with their
friends.

Acommiittee comprised of the

presidents and vice-presidents of
the eating houses, faculty advi-
sors, Kurt Holmes, and Dean Leslie
Marsicano, met before Thanks-
giving to discuss possible changes.
Their biggest concern involved sta-
bility and keeping all the houses
strong.

The committee decided to
implement clustering, eliminate
waiting lists and limit switching
between houses.

President of the Patterson
Court Council Julie Petty com-
ments that with clustering they
were “trying to look out for inter-
ests of the freshwomen so they
would have the chance to be with

- their friends.”

On Thursday, January 20, self
selection sheets will be filled out
and the results posted the next
morning. Freshwomen who self-
select have early morning phone
calls or cow bells to look forward
to informing them of their new

eating house.

_ Acomputerisfed allthenames
and theselectionis completely ran-
dom. According to the guidelines
this year “there are no ‘caps’ or
waiting lists involved.”

The computer will divide the
total number of freshwomen by
three and that will set the limit for
each house, Connor, Rusk and
Warner Hall. :

To allow the new members to
give their new houses a chance,
switching will not be allowed until

. the beginning of fall semester next

year.

Also in an effort to “try and
make women loyal to their houses,”
women may now switch houses
only once during their stay at
Davidson explains Petty.

With the prospect of cluster-
ing with their friends, freshwomen
can now be evenmore excited about
the impending self selection par-
ties.

THE COLLEGE

Greenhouse built on campus

Biology students and faculty
are excited about a recent addi-
tion to the Davidson campus. A
greenhouse costing $30,000 was
built in October next to the soccer
practice field.

Pat Peroni, assistant profes-
sor for biology, stated that
Davidson needed this new facil-

ity. “If we want to have a strong
biology department then we need
to have a large plant growth facil-
ity.” Peroni also spoke of the
advantages of working with plants
over animals.

These advantages included
that plants are less expensive to
work with and there are no ethical
questions involved when work-
ing with plants instead of ani-
mals,

The greenhouse covers 1,260
feet and maintains a temperature
between 70 and 85 degrees.

Both Peroni and associate
professor Pam Hay, Davidson’s
two plant biologists, will direct
class research and personal re-
search in the new greenhouse. .

‘Ault named fellow

Dr. Ruth Ault, professor of
psychology, has been named a
Fellow of the American Psycho-
logical Association. (APA)

Of the 119,00 members in
the association, fewer than five
percent have been given this
honor.

The Fellows are chosen by
the APA for their remarkable con-
tributions to psychology.

Ault cited this honor as an
affirmation that “the things that I
have been doing in my career are
valued by my colleagues.”

Ault has been an active mem-
ber of the APA since 1978, Over
the past three years she has helped
edit various journals, as well as
contributed to two books.

Currently, Aultis busy work-
ing in Davidson writing a text-
book on child development.

Senior wins physics award
Senior David Scott Rhodes

recently received the Marsh White
Prize at a meeting of the South-
eastern Section of the American
Physics Society in Columbia,
South Carolina.

Aphysics major at Davidson,
Rhodes’ presentation at the meet-|-
ing was judged the best of the 18
given by graduate and under-
graduate students in the region.

The award winning presen-
tation dealt with the non-linear
optical properties of cesium va-
por.

Rhodes’ research for the
project began last summer when

he worked as a lab assistant to Dr.
Mary Anne Moore, associate
physics professor at the college.

Originally from
Poughkeepsie, New York, Rhodes
haslivedin Raleigh, North Caro-
lina since 1892 where he received
his first introduction to physics at
Enloe High School.

In addition to physics, Rhodes
enjoys tennis, soccer and snow-
skiing.

Ruth honored top criminal jus-
tice educator

Dr. Bob Ruth, associate pro-
fessor of sociology, has received
the Margaret Lang Willis Out-
standing Criminal Justice Educa-
tor Award.

Ruth was named “Educator
of the Year” by the North Caro-
lina Criminal Justice Association,
for his academic contributions to
criminal justice.

Ruth joined the NCCJA in
1989. Since then, he has contin-
ued\to be actively involved in the
many facets of criminal justice.

Ruth said the award was most
meaningful because “I was nomi-
nated by a Davidson graduate who
was one of my former students.”
He also stated that the award came
as quite a surprise and served as a
“cap stone” for all of the work he
has done in the field of criminal
justice.

The Davidson Journal and the
Mecklenburg Gazette contrib-
uted to the news briefs.
