ORCHESTRA AND GLEE CLUB
TO BE BETTER ORGANIZED

A great deal of interest has been taken
lately in the Orchestra and Glee Club
by the members to perfect a better or-
ganization and put things on a more
businesslike basis. Heretofore there has
been scarcely any organization, but a
committee has been appointed composed
of W. H. Neal, E. P. Childs and J. R.
Morton to draw up a constitution and
by-laws, which it is believed will be
adopted by the end of November.

They propose to adopt a system of
awarding pins, as the “Wearers of the
D” to men who shall fulfill certain re-
quirements, making a man work for a
pin so it will be an honor to win one.
It is also the idea of the rules and regu-
lations to impose certain fines for un-
Necessary absences, tardiness, etc., at
practice, and make certain conditions un-
der which a man may make a trip.

~The Orchestra and Glee Club will
give a concert at Queens College,
Thanksgiving, and one on the Hill Sat-
urday night of Senior Speaking. Friday
of this week they will go to Lincolnton.

The Queens Choral Club will give a
concert next Spring here. at Davidson
under the auspices of the Orchestra and
Glee Club.

FRESHMAN LECTURE.

The regular semi-monthly lecture to
the Freshmen was given on November
roth by Dr. J. M. McConnell. In his
subject, “Gambling,” he explained the
meaning of the word, saying that gam-
bling was only degalized stealing, for the
definition of stealing is taking another
man’s property without giving value re-
ceived, and this is exactly what a man
does when he gambles. He impressed
the fact that while some forms of gam-
bling were legally right. they were mor-
ally wrong.

Some of the evils of gambling were
analyzed and it was shown that gam-
ling led to worse things, for all gambling
was derived from love of money, and
love of money is the root of all evil.

The Freshmen were also warned
against matching at soda fountains and
betting on games, for this leads to worse
things.

The speaker closed by asking the stu-
dents to think this over and as a class
to start a campaign against gambling in

any form at Davidson by refraining}to the present number.

from it themselves.

CLASS BASKETBALL

(Continued from page 1)
FRESH-SOPH.
In a game that was featured by num-
erous fouls and roughness, the Sophs

overwhelmed the Fresh Monday night!:

by a score of 24 to 5. The Fresh were
kept on the defensive thruout the entire
game, losing many chances to score, and
only scoring during the last six minutes
of play. The work of Alexander and
Hall for the Sophs was of stellar na-
ture, while Chalmers and Hall were the
luminaries for the first-year men.

MILITARY TRAINING IN
CONNECTION WITH GYM

During the past week military train-
ing was instituted in the Fresh gymnas-
ium classes. This is in connection with
the regular gymnasium work and it is
held at the same periods everv week.
K. F. Herrman is assisting P. B. Price,
the regular gymnasium instructor, in the
military drill. Herrman ‘served eight
years in the regular German army, with
two and one-half years of active service
in South Africa. With this experience
he should be well fitted to instruct the
classes in military drill.

- The Freshmen themselves seem to be
well pleased with this innovation.
