take this opportunity, therefore, to;

express their great appreciation to

homes’ to these girls. Nearly 200
girls were taken care of in the
homes of Davidson — splendid
evidence of the hospitality of the
people of the town of Davidson. We
are indeed grateful.

other students will be elected later
in the year, when the faculty advis-
ers have had a better opportunity
to judge their capacity in spoken
