MR. HILL’S LIFE
AN INTERESTING ONE

As Mr. John Hill is well known to
every student at Davidson, it will, no
doubt be interesting to know something
of his past life.

Mr. Hill was born January 31, 1846,
in Awre, near Newnham, England, the
third son of James and Miriam Hill.
His father died when John was but two
years old, leaving his wife three sons
and two daughters.

John started work when he could
only keep the cows from eating the corn.
At ten years of age he assisted in driv-
ing a team of four oxen. He next tend-
ed sheep and then worked as an appren-
tice on a dairy farm at ten dollars per
year cand board.

In his boyhood days he delighted in
watching the boats on the river (which
was two miles wide at his home), hop-
ing some day to discover the path of the
setting sun. The opportunity soon came
and he embarked on a. river-trader.
This soon became tame for John and he
shipped on a pilot boat which plied up
and down the Bristol channel. Its
crew comprised the pilot, his son and
John. Having learned the’ rocks and
shoals along the channel, it was very
pleasing to Tohn. as a boy of fifteen, to
play the role of captain, mate and’
crew; which often was the case when
the captain, moved by “spirits,” and his
son wotld seek repose on thin bunks,
and leave John in charge of the tiller,
and often against a heavy wind.

As John grew older and more ex-
perienced he became dissatisfied with the
monotonv of the duties of the pilot
boat. He. therefore, shipped as cabin
boy on a German bark-rigged ship sail-
ing from Cardiff, England, to Alakant,
on the Mediterranean coast of Spain.
On account of the law character of one
of the officers, he left this ship one night
and boarded a shin leaving port in the
early morning. They were pursued and
the shin searched, but he was not found.
for he had been stowed awav in the hold
among the timbers and freicht.

On entering the Bay of Biscav a tre-
mendous gale struck the ship. Soon the
shin hegan to leak and by midnight the
sails and mast had been swept away.
As the crew was occupied with the
pumps, John was put to the wheel. be-
ing so small he had to stand on blocks
to reach it.

In the morning, their condition being
hopeless, they raised the distress signal
One ship passed them unnoticed. About
noon thev were taken on board a Scotch
bark. The bark continued its course
toward South Africa and landed the
rescued on the Madina Islands. There
they were well treated by the English
consul.

Two weeks later they sailed on the
Roval mail steamer, which landed them
at Liverpool. There he secured a place
as “bov before the mast” on an Amer-
ican ship, the “Jabez Snow.” Thev
sailed with a shipload of cnal for Val-
parazo. South America. All went well
until they were in sight of South Amer-
ica. Tust off the mouth of the Amazon
the Confederate gunboat “Alabama”
bore down upon them, took them pris-
oners and burned their ship. While on
the “Alabama” he witnessed a fight be-
tween the “Alabama” and a Northern
gunboat off the West Indies, in which
the “Alabama” was victor.

OLD DAVIDSON MEN
ASSIST COACH FETZER

Last week several former Davidson
football stars assisted Coach Fetzer in
putting the squad thru a series of scrim-
mages and practice in charging and
tackling. These included Dr. N. B
Edgerton, of Columbia; R. B. Peters,
of Ebenezer, Tenn., a former Davidson
center; “Pete” Crayton, of Charlotte, a
one-time stellar end; “Bob” Denny, and
Everett Booe, for several seasons one of
the most brilliant end punters Davidson
has known. These men rendered valu-
able assistance, as Coach Fetzer’s hands
are unusually full this year, with such a
large number out for the team, and no
regular assistant.
