A CROOK IN THE TIGER'S TAIL.

For the mental basket we have found
something. Our contemporary, the edit-
or of The Tiger—the Clemson College
paper, has this to say about the game to-
morrow: “Yes, I mean exactly what |
say, we are going to beat them, and it is
for you to say how much.”

We do not presume to be so downright
dogmatic, but from all indications “Fet-
zerism” will wear the laurels tomorrow
as it has done in the last five contests.
Such dogmatism and assurance of which
our brother is guilty, we either burn in
a grate in Chambers. or send it to the
Power House as a deserved pabulum for
producing steam.

THANKSCIVING.

We, as men of Davidson, are grateful
to God for all those things which men
in common enjoy. But as students of
the college we should offer thanks to the
Supreme One for the things peculiar to
us. A complete catalog of these is, prob-
ably, not obtainable. Certainly we are
grateful for the vigorous and wise per-
sonality directing our football squad. For
the team itself, today one of the best in
the conntry—we are proud, hence thank-
ful. We are grateful that so many of
our brothers—the alumni—are so in-
tenscly patriotic and have willingly of-
fered their lives at the call of duty and
darger. W-° should be grateful for the

‘lof thought and action.

M.Jern literature.

The DAVIDSONIAN, November 28, 1917

“Y" Fund. Another thing that we share,
which is not to the lot of all college men
—every man on our faculty is a high-
tone Christian gentlemen, a scholar as
well as being interested in Christian edu-
cation. The home ties are stronger when
we are away—for this we should be
grateful. For the actively Christian men
and manifestations of Godliness and the
warmth of fellowship on the campus, we
should be deeply grateful.

We really do not know what we do
have. ‘Tomorrow we have no classes.
‘Tonight let us dedicate a short while for
serious reflection and make a list of the
things which we have received from an
Omnipotent Hand. Do this and you
will be surprised.

THE ECONOMIC READER.

Dr. Harding in talking to his class in
Greek Six gave a suggestion which
should be adopted by those who are pur-
suing «a reading course. He advises that
one read current papers and = maga-
vines to keep up with the current trend
But that one
should not try to read a great deal of
modern fiction and literature. Read
came, of course, but the impossible is te
scan an appreciable quantity of the out-
put. Read the book reviews, thru which
you can familiarize yourself with mod-
Make a scheme for
reading the classics, not — particularly
Greek and Latin literature, nor exclusive
of translations of them, but for the best
of American and English classics and
translations of the immortals in all lit-
cratures.

Decemher 2nd the New York Times
is to issue a review of more than two hun-
dred recent hooks. If interested in lit-
erature one should have, or have access
to one of these. This comes with the
Sunday edition. The ‘Times edits a
vood review. Other accessible period-
icals containing excellent curreat com-
ment are The Nation and ‘The Dial
Dr. Harding’s suggestion is good and
should students of literature adopt. this
and begin a svstemization of their read-
ing they would wonderfullyincrease the
results,

TILE WOFFORD SQUAD.

Campus opinion is that a cleaner and
more gentlemanly squad of men has not
visited our college than the Woffordians.
Our squad praises their fairness on the
gridiron. And too, it was a good omer
when some of them were inquiring the
way to praver meeting. Wofford men
are always welcome ‘to the Hill.

LARGE NUMBER PRESENT
AT JOINT MEETING

The Christian Endeavor, Ministerial
and Volunteer Bands held a joint mect-
ing Sunday night, the leader being J. K
Woods. The regular Christian Endeavor
topic, “For what am 1 grateful,” was
used,

The leader made a short talk, emoha-
sizing the fact that gratitude is one of the
fundamental virtues. Then all of the
‘hings for which men should be grateful.
there being three the leader especially
mentioned. First, there are those physi-
cal blessings which come every day; sec-
ond, we should be thankful for Christian
narents and Christian environment, and
thirdly. for Christ’s sacrifice for us.

Following the leader’s talk, other
short talks were made by Cumming, Mc-
Clvre Clark, Hollandsworth, Maddrev
and Orgain.

CIVIC LEAGUE BAZAAR.

The ladies of the Civic League held
their annual bazaar in ‘the Civic League
Hall last Saturday afternoon .between
3 and 6 o'clock. The hall was patriot-
ically decorated with red, white and blue.
There were five booths representing the
different ages of women. Mrs. Jackson
and Miss Mammie Withers were in
charge of the “Baby” booth; Miss
Maude Vincent had the booth for
“Young Ladies;’ Mrs. A. Brown the
“Bride's” booth; Mrs. Arbuckle the
“Housckeeper’s” booth, and Mrs. W. R.
Grev was in charge of the “Grandmoth-
ers" booth. At the bride’s booth little
Sara Jetton and James Withers stood
dressed up as bride and groom. On ac-
count of the scarcity of sugar there was
no candy on sale, yet there was an

abundance of canned fruit and fancy
work. The ladies realized more than
$24 from the afternoon’s sale.
