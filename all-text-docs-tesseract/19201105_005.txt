With regard to musical instruments
the students are divided into two classes
—those who play them and those who
cuss them. The latter class predom-
inates.

Notice.
Our MacSwiney club has gone into
the hands of receivers.

Brady Thrilis Students.

Praises Work of Captain Hammett—
Speaks of Date with Sweetheart after
Game.

In masterful oration before the en-
tire Davidson student body Hon. Sam
Breeches Brady tells what he and team
are going to do in Charlotte. Enjoyable
Social event after game described.
Speech in detail follows:

(Brady interrupted by prolonged ap-
plause.)

It was worth reading,

Or even funny ;

Although

Many have admitted that
It was amusing because

It was so sad,

But we've got a darn good
Disposition,

And in order to fill up
These two columns

I'm writing this junk
Again,

And in case we do happen to
Make vou laugh

Why, tell somebody about it,

And then tell us

And we'll appreciate it:

And if we write about you
And it makes you sore
Why, run and swallow some
Carbolic acid,

Iv'll let vou forget.

And remember that this space

Has got to be filled;
So bear with us,
And—that’s all.

—The Crimson-White.

Whatcha Know

The following poem, published in the
Tar Baby, was sent to a certain brown-
eyed Davidson student by the fair au-

thor at Chicora College.

Lam dreaming of you only,
Of your beautiful brown eyes;

"Bout That?

And which to me can never lie.

You're a good judge Ray; we like Her

Each day, how I miss
The soft touch of your lips
In a passionate kiss.

Dear folks:

We have written

For two years already
And haven't yet

Fricker where’s your overcoat?
And when you, my dear,

With a kiss quench my thirst,

There'll be no July First.

ow Large is an Atom?

TOMS are s0 infinitesimal that to be seen under the most power-

ful microscope one hundred million must be grouped. The atom
used to be the smallest indivisible unit of matter. When the X-Rays
and radium were discovered physicists found that they were dealing
with smaller things than atoms—with particles they call “electrons.”

Atoms are built up of electrons, just as the solar system is built up
of sun and planets. Magnify the hydrogen atom, says Sir Oliver
Lodge, to the size of a cathedral, and an electron, in comparison, will
be no bigger than a bird-shot.

Not much substantial progress can be made in chemical and elec-
trical industries unless the action of electrons is studied. For that
reason the chemists and physicists in the Research Laboratories of the
General Electric Company are as much concerned with the very con-
stitution of matter as they are with the development of new inven-
tions. They use the X-Ray tube as if it were a machine-gun; for by
its means electrons are shot at targets in new ways so as to reveal more
about the structure of matter.

As the result of such experiments, the X-Ray tube has been greatly
improved and the vacuum tube, now so indispensable in radio com-
munication, has been developed into a kind of trigger device for guid-
ing electrons by radio waves.

Years may thus be spent in what seems to be merely a purely
“theoretical” investigation. Yet nothing is so practical as a good
theory. The whole structure of modern mechanical engineering is
reared on Newton's laws of gravitation and motion—theories stated
in the form of immutable propositions.

In the past the theories that resulted from purely scientific re-
search usually came from the university laboratories, whereupon the
industries applied them. The Research Laboratories of the General
Electric Company conceive it as part of their task to explore the un-
known in the same spirit,even though there may be no immediate
commercial goal in view. Sooner or later the world profits by such
research in pure science. Wireless communication, fur example, was
accomplished largely as the result of Herz's brilliant series of purely
scientific experiments demonstrating the existence of wireless waves.

OUR NEW HOME

D5§SIGNED and built with definite ideas of what the
home of a printing plant should be. Seven thousand
square feet of floor space, for the convenience and facili-
ties necessary to planning and producing printing that
gets results.
When in Charlotte we shall be glad to have you stop in
to inspect our new home, or to confer on printing prob-
lems that may confront you.
