PHI SOCIETY HOLDS
‘ EXCELLENT MEETING

Eus Decide Against Bonus for
™ ex-Service Men.

Phi Society

The society was called to order
by the vice-president, J. A. Poteat,
and was ably led by him into one of
the best meetings of the year. De-
bating for the affirmative side of the
question, “Resolved that the U. S.
government should give a bonus of
$1.25 to ex-service men for each day
in the service,” E. N. Booker, C. K.
Brown, and C. G. Long won an
unanimous decision from the nega-
tive, supported by J. M. Dunlay, L.

Nichols, and C. N. Morrison.
The decision was very much in
doubt from the fact that Booker re-
tired after his last speech without
giving a rebuttal. F. V. Long fol-
lowed the lively debate with equally
as live a discussion of the subject
“Determination.” As usual the ex-
temp debate was hotly contested,
neither side advancing an argument.
Since the question was slightly in-
clined toward the negative, that
exams should be held after com-
mencement, the judges decided for
the affirmative. Under the head of
new business, J. C. Waol was elected
treasurer for next year. Officers
for the next years will be installed
at the regular meeting next Satur-
day night.

Eu Society

The Eumenean Literary Society
at its meeting last Saturday night
carried through a very interesting
program. The question for debate
was: Resolved, “That the ex-sol-
dier should be paid a dollar and a
half for every day he was in ser-
vice.” Roberts, é. B., Roddy,
and Winter and Boyd upheld the
affirmative, while Bradley, Jewel,
King and Saunders defended the
negative. Although a number of
good points were brought out on
both sides, the judges decided in
favor of the negative.

After the debate a declamation
was given by H. H. Smith, on “In-
gersoll at the Grave of Napoleon.”
This was followed by an oration,
“The umpraised Hero” by C. J.
Matthews. The society was then
adjourned to meet ony one more
time this session.

POLITY CLUB TO HEAR
NOTED FOREIGNER

Treat Promised Davidson Students
in Form of Lecture by

In a letter received this week b
Dr. J. M. McConnel, from the Insti-
tute of International Education, an
opportunity was offered of hearing
Baron S. A. Korff,.of Russia, spea
to the International Relation Club
here on May 6. As Baron Korff is
highly recommended as an author-
ity on the Russian situation, it is
probable that arrangements will be
made to have him here on the sug-
gested date, or some other conven-
ient date.

Baron Korff has the following his-
tory: “A Russian nobleman by
birth, he held the position of assist-
ant governor-general of Finland
under the provisional government
of Prince Lvoff and Kernesky; he
was formerly professor of constitu-
tional Law at the university of
Helsingfors, Finland, and at the wo-
men’s college of Petrograd; and in
1919 he served with the Russian
Peace Delegation at Paris. For a
man who has known Russia at first
hand during the past few years, and
who has suffered from the Bolshe-
viki, he speaks with unusual fair-
ness and liberality.”

opportunity of hearing Baron
Korff will probably be given to the
entire student body, and it is hoped
that a large number will turn out to
hear him.

“You should have seen her face
light up.”
“Did you set off the powder?”

DAVIDSON-CORNELIUS
POST OF AMERICAN
LEGION ORGANIZED

More Than a Hundred Members
Enrolled. Officers Elected

The Davidson-Cornelius Post of
the American Legion began life
with a bang on the night of Wednes-
day, April the twenty-eighth. More
than one hundred members were en-
rolied at a rousing meeting held in
the Masonic hall at Davidson. Since
soldiers from both vicinities lost
their lives in France the name,
Davidson-Cornelius Post, was deem-
ed the only one which could be
justly given. The principal object
of the meeting was the election of
officers, These officers are: Post
Commander, Dr. J. W. McConnell ;
Vice-Commanders, Conrad Shelton
and Tertius Stough; Executive
Committee, Harry Caldwell, Pal-
mer Henderson, C. D. Guion and
Douglass Brown; Insurance Officer,
Cloyd Potts; Vocational Officer,
Zeb Holly ; Secretary and Treasurer,
Roderick Beard.

The post favors all possible aid,
both financial and educational, to
the wounded and disabled service
men, and also, endorses the Fordney
bill which is now before Congress.
The post is opposed to a cash bonus,
paid in a lump sum. .

SENIORS CELEBRATE
TION

The Senior Class is preparing to
celebrate. At a recent meeting they
decided to hold the long deferred
banquet. L. L. McAlister was
elected manager and told to “go to
it.” It will be held on the night of
the 21st, after all the Seniors are
through, and are just about ready
to “take the Dip.”

Where it will be is as yet un-
decided. Manager McAlister is
looking into the good points of both
the Selwyn in Charlotte and the
O Henry in Greensboro. Already
the menus are being prepared by
the two hotels and the best will be
accepted.

COMMENCEMENT CLIPPINGS.

Commencement this year will be
one of the most interesting and at-

them by staying thru the exercises.
