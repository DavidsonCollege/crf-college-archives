the shot.

It just;wasn’t Davidson’s
night Monday, when Appala-
chian State took a 71-53
conference win from the Wild-
cats. Just ask the referees.

The Mountaineers paid no
attention to Davidson's
“home court advantage” and
blistered the nets at a 60
percent rate in the first half.
At the same time the Wildcats
had their troubles finding the
range and managed to hit only
35.7 percent.

This included one stretch of
six minutes when we failed to
score at all and the Apps ran
up a 31-15 lead. At halftime
the scoreboard read 35-21.

Freshman forward Rod Ow-
ens led a Davidson charge in
the second half that brought
the lead down to seven points
but the Apps recovered and
managed to put-it away.

Owens scored 18 points in
the last half while playing with
four fouls. That’s an especially
remarkable effort considering
the quality officiating.

Pat Hickert played a fine
game inside. He led the Wild-
cats in rebounding for the
fourth straight game with 8
and added 13 points and 4
blocked shots.

A couple other blocks were
taken from him because of
some confusion on the refer-
ees’ part concerning goaltend-
ing. It appears that the proper
way to block a shot is to pin it
on the backboard. Unfortun-
ately, no one but Appalachian
and the refs knew.

It was also legal to use the
rim for pull-ups.

For the most part, however,
Davidson’s troubles were
caused by the offense. At
times, the Cats lost their poise
and didn’t take the good shot.
When they got one, they
didn’t hit it.

John Gerdy was character-
istic of the offensive difficut-
ties as he managed only nine
points. It was the first time in
Gerdy’s career that he didn’t
score in double figures.

Gerdy, who was leading the
Southern Conference in scor-
ing before the game with a 24
point average, managed to
keep his average at 20.0 with
9,

Coach Pritchett spoke of the
team’s lack of game exper-
ience. ‘‘We’re starting two
freshmen, two sophomores
and one senior who has little
experience. And our first sub
inside is another freshman.

“We certainly need to dis-
play poise from a team stand-
point.”’

Davidson is presently 1-3
and 0-1 in the conference. The
team travels to Rollins Satur-
day in search of win number
two and moves on to Atlanta
December 15 for a game with
Georgia Tech.

Their next home game will
be in the Coliseum on the 18th
against Brigham Young.
