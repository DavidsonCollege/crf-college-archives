ports of unions on the campus. As
was the duty of the group, the stu-
dent council took immediate ac-
tion.

In the middle of the Davidsonian
election, they proposed an amend-
ment to the constitution which pro-
vided for the editor-in-chief of the
Davidsonian to be elected by the
editorial staff of this publication.
However, the amendment failed to
pass the student body’s approval.

Too, he clarified the accused
parties who were not found guilty
of combine. Stating the definition
of a combine, this term proved to
include non-fraternity organiza-
tions as well as social fraternities.
The definition “Any indiv-
idual influencing or group swapping

reads:

date or candidates in return for

COUNCIL MET REN

It is the duty of the stu-
dent council to: “Investi-
gate rumors injurious to the
good name of the student
hody or to any member
thereof. At all times they
shall strive toward the im-
provement of conditions of
the campus.” Consequently,
on February 27, the student
council met to discuss and
provide for the smooth
working of the coming elec-
tion period. Believing it in
keeping with the Davidson
type of student government
and also the consensus of
opinion of the student body,
the student council voted
unanimously that there
should be no politics, un-
ions, or combines during
our elections, and to en-
force this provision passed
the following resolution.

“.. The student council
requests each fraternity to

pass the following resolu-
tions :

“This. fraternity as a
