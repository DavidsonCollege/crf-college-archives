According to local park rangers,

turned the idiomatic world on its
head by shitting in the Port-A-John

According to recent scientific
findings, beauty is a quantifiable
and genetic trait, much like height,

vertical leaping ability or
wingspan.
“That ‘eye of the beholder’

malarkey is pure Romantic blas-
phemy,” genetic researcher Mark
Anselmo said. “Keats obviously
never took Biology.”

Samuel Belkins ’10 reached a
boiling point Thursday night while
dining out with his parents.

“Yeah, us classics majors already
aren’t taken seriously on this cam-
pus, and then my dad has to go and
make some lame joke about the
‘roman’ lettuce in my salad, and
how that somehow relates to Julius
Caesar and therefore me because
I’m a classics major...” Belkins
fumed.

His father, Edward Belkins, was
not available for questioning.

Park rangers reported the bowel
movement was clean and definate-
ly not human, claiming that Franky
had used toilet paper but left the
seat up.

The gesture has already made an
impact beyond the Mooresville
community. Davidson Professor of
Linguistics Gotlieb Kranklstein
explained the significance of the
event for the English langauge.

“Now every time someone asks,
‘Well does a bear shit in the
woods?’ he will have to qualify his
question by admitting — that,
anamolous or not, in late October
of 2007, a bear actually did not shit
in the woods.”

“People will have to resort to the
less visceral, much blander, ‘Is the
Pope Catholic?’ perhaps precipitat-
ing the downfall of the rhetorical
question.”

contain the beauty gene.

Studies have shown that the
beauty gene, with slight mutation,
can form the Nice-to-look-at-but-
you-wouldn’t-want-to-marry-her
gene, as happened with Paris
Hilton.

“The fact of the matter,”
Anselmo said, “is that beauty is a
constant. Every straight man is
going to behold Natalie Portman’s
backside in the exact same way.”

yelled.

He then continued complaining
about how, contrary to popular
belief, the triumvirate is not repre-
sented through the salad’s triple
alliance of croutons, olive oil and
black pepper.

After his father argued that the
tableside preparation of the Caesar
salad was analogous to Julius
Caesar’s transformation of the
Roman Republic into the Roman
Empire, Samuel began to cry.

“It made me empathize with
Caesar even more in the moments
right before he was assasinated. I
felt his pain. The optimates known
as ‘mother’ and ‘father’ will be
conquered in the near future. This
is just a Caesar salad, not Rex.
Please tell me someone will under-
stand that reference.”

Samuel Belkins then reordered a
house salad and wept quietly to
himself.
