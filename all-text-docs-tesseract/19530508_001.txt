Lafferty Speaker|,:
At Sports Banque
On Monday Night

The third annual All-Sports Ban-
quet will be held at 6:30 p. m.
Monday, May 11, in Johnston Gym-
nasium. This banquet climaxes the
sports year, with conference golf,
tennis, and track being the only
remaining sports.

Monday night’s speaker will be
Mr. Luther “Teeny” Lafferty, who
is at present an executive in a
hosiery mill in Concord. He was
one of the greatest backs in the
history of Davidson football, play-
ing here in the mid 30's.

Until 1951, various banquets had
been held for different sports; but
beginning then, one big All-Sports
Banquet has been held. In 1951,
Mr. Wallace Wade, then commis-
sioner of the Southern Conference,
was the speaker. Last year, the
director of sports publicity at the
University of North Carolina, Mr.
Jake Wade, spoke.

Approximately two hundred and
forty guests are invited to attend
the banquet. These include all ath-
letes who successfully completed
the past sports year and special
guests from the faculty and the
Athletic Council.

Professor W. G. McGavock will
be the toastmaster, and awards will
be made in various sports by the
respective coaches. Two highlight
awards are the Armfield Blocking
Trophy and the “out-standing fresh-
man of the year,” which is made
by the freshman “D” Club. Cer-
tificates will also be given to letter
winners at the banquet.

n April 9, 1953.

Auburn, then a second Lieuten-
ant, led a reconnaissance patrol
into hostile territory near Mondo,

rea.

Approaching the objective, the
forward element of the patrol sud-
denly came under small arms and
grenade fire from a nearby enemy
trench. The initial burst of fire
fatally wounded one of the patrol
members, who fell by the hestile
fosition. Lieutenant Lambeth quick-
ly reorganized his patrol and held
his ground.

Then, completely disregarding
his own personal safety, he made
his way directly toward the enemy
position in an attempt to recover
the body, but was forced back by
the intensity of the hostile fire.

With the assistance of a volunteer, |-

Auburn made a second attempt to
evacuate the’ body.

He fought his way to within a
few feet of the enemy position, but
was turned back once more by a
withering barrage of small arms
fire and white phosphorus grenades
from the now reinforced enemy.
Lambeth’s heroic efforts were a
great inspiration to the men under
his command. His courage, de-
termination and devotion to his fel-
low soldier are in keeping with the
high traditions of the U. S. Army.

During his years here Auburn
was an outstanding football player,
and was especially noted for pass-
ing ability. He was a member of
Phi Delta’ Theta fraternity, and
also Omicron Delta Kappa, of which
he was president.

winner, “Bridge of San Luis Rey,”

It stars Louis Calhern, Lynn Bari,
Akim Tamiroff, and Francis Leder-

betrayal of Korea by Alger Hiss
as witnessed personally by him dur-
ing the years 1941 through 1944
while he was American advisor to
Dr. Syngman Rhee, President of
the Republic of Korea, in Wash-

Masquer’s Production Of Hamlet
Concludes 1953 Fine Arts Festival

Shakespeare’s immortal tragedy,
Hamlet, will be presented by the
Red and Black Masquers Monday
and Tuesday nights, May 11, 12, in
Chambers auditorium, concluding
the Fine Arts Festival of Renais-
sance Art, Literature and Drama.
Curtain time on both nights will
be 8:15 p. m.

In the title role will be Tad

‘Currie as the mentally depressed

vistim of the sins of others which
have such dynamic and explosive
effects on his character that Ham-
let is probably the most terrible
of all Shakespearean tragic charac-
ters.

This will be the graduating
senior’s last performance on the
Davidson stage and promises to
provide a brilliant climax to his
many memorable roles in previous
plays.

Three other seniors who have
been almost indispensable in
Davidson Masquer's productions
during their college years will also
be ending their local theatrical
careers in the morose drama.

George Walker will appear as
King Claudius of Denmark, who
despite his acts of hardened vil-
lainy in murdering his brother so
he can become king and marry the
beautiful Queen, still has genuine

dent Union. “The Corcican Broth-| virtue in him, thus adding to the

ers” will be shown on May 23.

pathos of the play. r

By GILBERT GRAGG

Vance Mizelle, who is bound for
graduate school in dramatics next
fall, has long been a popular figure
on the local stage and will play
the role of Polonius, Lord Chamber-
lain.

Rounding out this skillful trio of

experienced Davidson dramatic
stars will be Mac Doubles as
Horatio, Hamlet’s loyal friend.
_ Providing the feminine interest
in the play will be Mrs. Mary Lou
Daggy, who will long be remem-
bered for an unforgettable in-
terpretation of the character of
Lady Macbeth in the presentation
of Macbeth last spring, as the love-
ly but sinful Queen Gertrude, and
petite Peggy Whittle, a senior at
North Mecklenburg High School
as the sweet innocent Ophelia.

The supporting cast is notable
for its excellence and will include
such veterans and talented new-
comers as: Dick Little as gallant
Gyldenstern, Jinks Jervey as court-
ier Rosencrantz, Fred Summers as
Bernado; Luther Yaun as Osric,
and Bob Crutchfield as Laertes.

Others in the cast include: Don
Crosby as the Ghost of Hamlet’s
father, Charlie Burnett as Marcel-
lus, Charles Babcock as Francisco,
K. E. Spiers as Reynaldo, and Dun-
bar Ogden, Malcolm Williamson,
and Mary Beatty as the three
players.

Lavishness is the only word to
describe the impressive costumes
which have been designed by Van
Horn of Philadelphia and are
valued at around two hundred and
fifty dollars.

This is the same company which
made many of the gay extravagant
costumes for this year’s colorful
Mardi Gras in New Orleans, and
the gorgeous costumes promise to
be one of the highlights of the
evening.

Professor Tyson has adapted the
play for the Masquers and is the
director. In charge of production
is Bob Mims while the Publicity
Department is being handled by
Hobart Martin and Swain Loy.

Other technical workers who will
help make the play a success are
Buddy Beheeler, lights; Bill
Crymes, Make-Up; Martin McGirt
for Properties; Bill Pharr, Promp-
ter; and Mrs. Mary Lou Daggy,
Costumes.

From all reports this will be the
best Shakespearean play yet by the
Masquers who gave Julius Caesar
in 1951 and Macbeth last year be-
fore enthusiastic audiences.

The admission price is fifty
cents, and a large attendance is
urged for the cast and crew have
been working extremely hard and
will provide a thrilling and enjoy-
able evening to all who attend.
