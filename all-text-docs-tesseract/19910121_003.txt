“But I resent the facade that

“The coalition is a fake and

of acounter-protest dominated the
media, although many of the
Davidsonians claim the counter-
protesters were few, and felt few
protesters were even aware of the
counter-protesters’ presence.

pated as a peace advocate.

Many of the Davidson students
felt the rally was productive in
sending a loud message to the
President, but felt the message may
not have been clear.

violence and peace as an answer,
rather than war and military ag-
gression. Although I was disturbed

Though Grey had to endure
this unfamiliar horror of not know-
ing what was going on with her
brother she still supports President
Bush’s actions.

Grey said, “People should
support the troops.” She then fol-
lowed up by saying, “I never
thought we would have a war dur-
ing this generation.”

Freshmen Molly Sentell also
has a brother, Sherburne Sentell,
serving in Saudi Arabia. Sher-
burne graduated in the same class

"as Grey’s brother, Rufus, and was

also in the ROTC.

Sherburne was one of the first
soldiers sent to over to Saudi Ara-
bia. He is a 2nd Lieutenant in the
82nd Airborne. Just before leav-
ing for the gulf, he had become
engaged to Patricia Henderson 89.

With unfamiliar territory one
must attempt to understand it.
Molly describes her attempt to
understand her brother’s situation,
“I respect him for his beliefs...He
believes he is protecting us. Hede-

‘scribes it as if there were an in-

truder in the house.”

Molly also states, “At

by some of the angry voices of
some of the more radical groups at
the rally, I felt that it was more im-
portant that people voiced their
opposition to the war,” said sopho-
more Romylynn Cunanan.
Despite the presence of groups
which denounced the United States
for everything, and whose slogans

by-side, joined in the effort to stop
this war and to save lives. The
sentiment was a positive one, sup-
porting the troops by wanting to
save their lives, and supporting
peace in the Middle East and
throughout the world.”

diverged from peace and non-vio-
lence, other students feltconfident
that the rally and march was aclear
sign of unity amongst people who
feel Bush’schoice to go to war was
a detrimental one.

Molly Graver, the head of
Davidson’s Political Action Com-
mittee and organizer of the
Davidson component in the rally,
said, “I felta great sense of solidar-
ity inthe march. Everybody, from
adiversity of groups, walked side-

drive a motorcycle, an active guy.
So I know he is where he wants to
be...I just want Bush to do what-

as possible.”

J Along with Bush’s actions,

causing more problems than
they’re solving. I disagree; we
know the same ‘facts’ as everyone
else, and we believe in a peaceful
solution. Now that the war has
started, our mission is to stop any-
more bloodshed and to protect all
the lives that are in jeopardy,
whether they be American, Iraqui,
Israeli, Kuwaiti, or any other.
We're talking about humanity,
something: people seem to have
forgotten about.”

way for Dennis to come home

senior Mike Peters, whose father
served over:five months in Iran
before coming back home to work
in the Pentagon, said, “I support
the President...We must do what it
takes to bring Saddam Hussein to
talk. ”

Senior Lisa LeNard, whohasa
brother, Dennis LeNard, serving
as amember of the Nuclear Bomb
Chemical Warfare since the end of
August, told her side of the story:

“Some people are anti-war.
They are the ones whodonot under-
stand. If you look at the fight
against Hussein it is trying to ac-
complish peace for the world...We
must neutralize his power in order
to bring peace.”

Lisa supported Bush’s attack,
she said, “I don’t think my view on

old) is actually in a war.” Lisa ex-
plained.

This idea of trying to accept
reality was felt by junior Joey
Manibo. Joey said, “The idea of
war did not really hit me until I
heard my uncle was on his way to
Saudi Arabia...Before I looked at
the war through my cyes, now I
look at the war through my heart.”

Out of these students with rela-
lives overseas, all shared a feeling
that Lisa LeNard best expressed,
“The support here at Davidson is
amazing. I wouldn’t want to be
anywhere else-in the world.”

After all the worrying and
concern, Grey Timberlake’s words
describe the feeling of the Davidson
community: “Bad times bring the
best out of people.”
