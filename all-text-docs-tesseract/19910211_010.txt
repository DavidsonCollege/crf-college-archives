Undecided About Whether To Apply For Hall

Hall Counselor Experience Establishes Relationship of
Trust And Understanding

By Prem Manjooran

Halfway through the year, I
assert that my junior year as a Hall
Counselor has been my best year at
Davidson. As I skimmed the list of
next year’s Hall Counselors posted
outside the Dean of Students’
Office, my thoughts flew back to
that single searing flash of illumi-

and the limitations of time and
space. I have learned the value of
stepping back and objectively

weaknesses. The implications, and
the repercussions, of a total per-

heavy in the pit of my stomach,
and my pulse threatening to choke
my tonsils, I ripped open the enve-

screamed my exultation. (This is
probably a good time to apologize
to the old gentleman who thought
I had won the Sweepstakes, and
was ready to put in his bid for a
sporty red BMW!)

Indeed, I had won a prize, but
it was a prize that I have been
unable to put a value on. My expe-

honed. The knack of maintaining

Blowout, The Queen
City's New Night Club Spot

By Rob Kelley

What? A new club?

I was looking through the lat-
estissue of CREATIVE LOAFING
when I saw the ad. THE
BLOWOUT...The Only Club
Designed for Live Rock ‘N’
Roll!.:.Thursday, January
24..COLLEGE NIGHT...FREE
DRAFT...ALTERNATIVE MU-
SIC...$3/College ID

Below was an address I recog-
nized from a former club called
WEEKENDS, which wasactive in
the early eighties.

Unfortunately, with that club,
the typical age of the clientele (14-
18) and the seediness of the area
(the Cinema Blue X-rated Theatre
sat not fifty yards away) eventu-
ally killed all success.

I arrived at the club at about
12:15 am Thursday night. Located
in the back corner of a dark shop-
ping center, the storefront was dark

except for a thin light from the”

double doors and a neon sign on
the roof: BLOWOUT. Looking to
my right, I noticed that the Cinema
Blue had been boarded up.

Inside I saw all the makings of
a nifty alternative club. It was
multi-leveled and multi-roomed,

with black walls, orange-and-yel-

low neon strips, and a dance floor
surrounded by white columns and
chess-board floor patterns. Very,
very nifty.

The bathrooms were especially
interesting, painted all in black,
with glow-in-the-dark handprints

on the walls and footprints on the
floor.

And yet, for all its alternative
potential, the club was hampered
by one thing: the people there.
Though no more than thirty inhab-
ited the large dance floor, all were
young and clean-cut, and none were
dancing.

The guys had delicate white
faces, turtlenecks, braided belts,
and very clean rugby shirts. I saw
one guy, apparently a young busi-
nessman, in white broadcloth and
a silk tie. The women, their girl-
friends, reminded me of two Snow
White dwarves: Sleazy and Gig-
gly.

I got the impression these kids
were from UNCC, but this con-
fused me greatly. I know anumber
of people.at, UNCC, and they do
not look like these did. The atten-
dants were most like a small mi-
nority, I decided, probably a fan
club for the equally young band,
who were talented, but still seemed
to be playing to the converted. (By
the way, I’m sure UNCC is going
to take this the wrong way. Please
understand, I’m complimenting
you here!)

I danced for a while, but found
that NIKE cross-trainers don’t
cross over into choreographic
maneuvering. Bo don’t dance.

On my way out, I ran into the
club manager, Charlie Guiducci.
We talked a bit about the club,
which he told me had opened four
weeks ago.

to an art form. I have developed
variations in negotiation techniques
and diplomatic skills as the buffer
between irate administration and
freshman frolic.

And as I step back again, it is
clear that I have not had a single
bad experience on my hall. In fact,
the hall has invariably beena place
of refuge. Secure in the knowl-
edge that you are indeed among
friends who wish nothing but the
very best for you, the hall is the
fold into which any form of retreat
is perfectly acceptable. I expected
to enjoy this year, but so far, the
year has surpassed my every ex-
pectation. I am going to come out
of this year having made friends
that I will be proud to acknowl-

edge for the rest of my life. As .

much as we seem to have put into
our hall, my roommate and I have
been repaid-- itnow seems that we
are the ones that are indebted for
the gifts of unqualified friendship,
unconditional support, affection,
trustand respect. And Ido believe
that I speak for all the Hall
Counselors: Thank You Fresh-
man Halls for a wonderful year.
The Class of 1995 is athand. Enjoy.

“The whole inside was redone
and repainted,” he said proudly.
How does he see his club fitting in
with the others?

“We’re located closer to
UNCC...we’re planning to give
those students a lot for their
money.”

Unlike other clubs in Char-
lotte, Guiducci plans to focus pri-
marily on local, Charlotte bands.
“The only live rock ‘n’ roll club in
Charlotte. Alternative on Thurs-
days, rock ‘n’ roll on weekends.”

He explained further. Mix
tapes, while employed, wouldonly
be used to fill gaps within sets.
Two bands would play each week-
end night. It was unsure whether
Thursday would all host bands
continually.

While an interesting idea, I
can’t see this strategy to be of
much use to Davidson students.
We get more than our fill of bands
through the Court and the Union,

and we’re better off by through the -

filter they provide. Secondly, the

typeof people frequenting theclub _

that night were not particularly
lively.

Still, if you recognize a band
that’s playing, The Blowout is an
ideal place to see them. And the
club has definitely not found its
final audience.

If you find an Alternative
Thursday (College Night) without
a band playing, you might want to
bring along four to six friends and
grab the dance floor.

Is Different From Our Own

By John Patton

Some of you thought I was
crazy,and some of you understood.
When I decided to forego the op-
portunity to be a hall counselor,
it wasn’tan easy decision. It wasa
personal decision in the sense that
each person has his or her own
goals andaspirations to guide them-

warm weather or the social oppor-
tunities. I did for the chance to see

_ aculture and experience a people

that is entirely different from our
own. Ihad spent three years work-
ing on the Russian language, and
this would provide me the chance
to practice.

Most importantly the decision

The decision forced me to look at my future, and
Russian was in that future. Thus, the more I
thought about it, the easier it was for me to decide.

selves, but maybe a recounting of
my thought process would help
those who are now wrestling with
the same question.

When I decided to apply for
hall counselor, I did so because I
wasn’t sure whether I would have
the opportunity to go the Soviet
Union. When heard in April that
I had such an opportunity, I had
already been a future hall coun-
selor for two months. [had been to
meetings with other future hall
counselors and to the retreat. The
more time] spent with these people
the more I became excited... Being
a hall counselor is a great way to
become an integral part of the
Davidson College Community. So
why did I go to Moscow.

I can tell you it wasn’t for the
relaxing atmosphere, the food
(mostly potatoes and beets), the

forced me to lookat my future, and
Russian language was in that fu-
ture. Thus the more! thoughtabout
it, the easy it was for mé to decide.
Finally the changes in Europe and
especially the Soviet Union were
too facsinating for me to forego the
opportunity to see them.

What it comes down to is
what’s right for you. There’s no
right or wrong, but only a better or
a less better depending on each
person’s preference. Being a
campus leader and helping fresh-
men deal with college life versus
living in-another-culture are the
issues to be weighed. i

One creates the occasion to
have animmediateimpacton fresh-
man’s lives and the other lays the
foundation for future goals, It is
not a right/wrong question, but a
matter of personal opinion.
