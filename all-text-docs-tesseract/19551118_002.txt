Davidson Politics

In this day of political planning, in-
decision, and tension it is imperative to
a sound and continuing democracy that
each member of that democracy be in-
formed and interested in affairs of the
current scene. We hope that the David-
son student is intelligently aware and
thoughtfully provoked about the current
political crisis, especially since over one-
fourth of the student body will be of vot-
ing age for the next presidential election.
We further assume that such reflection is
recorded in the opinion poll of November
4th conducted by Editor Brice. The final
tabulations revealed some notable con-
trasts and thinking points.

First, it is an interesting fact that
40 percent of the student body, 90 per-
cent of whose membership is from the
deep South, are Republican by preference.
This is a higher number than evident in
popular elections in which the GOP has
polled on the average about 34 percent
of the vote of the South over the last half
century.

It was generally agreed (85 percent)
that Ike would be President if he ran
again, but 65‘: felt that he would not run.
Ike’s popularity is individual popularity
according to the '52 election figures which
‘gave him 48.9 percent in the South. while
GOP Congressmen received only 21.4 per-
cent of the total Southern vote. If Eisen-
hower does not run, will his popularity be
transfered or transferable to his party
“nominee for '56? In a recent national Gal-
lup Poll, “No alternate GOP nominee now
on the scene polled much more than the
token vote normally accorded a Republi-
can presidential candidate below the Ma-
son and Dixon line,” Stevenson outlasting
both Warren and Nixon by sizeable ma-
jorities in individual preference.

The independent vote in the student
body was 17 percent of the total. On an-
other recent Gallup, party affiliation of
Independents was: Republican 35 percent.
Democratic 25 percent, no difference and
no opinion catching the rest. However Da-
vidson doesn’t always follow the national
norm; it more often deviates therefrom.

In the realm of preference and expec-
tation questions, the Republican party
preference sheet closely approximated the
expectation scores on presidential nomi-
nees.

It was an entirely different story in
the Democratic party. 75 percent of the
students contacted believed that Steven-
son would receive the Democratic nomina-
tion; but only 42 percent of the Democrats
listed him as their personal choice: The
man who vaulted on the preferential poll
was Senator Russell of Georgia: 3 per-
cent expected that he would be the nom-
inee, while 33 percent desired that he
become the nominee. Evidently much po-
litical favoritism remains from the days of
the last electional period when Russell was
in prominent contention and appeal.

Again on the Brice poll, it was quite
evident that Republicans are more gener-
ally diffused on their preferential strength
vote than the Democrats. Stevenson and
Russell compiled 75 percent of the pre-
ferred ballots while it took four Republi-
can candidates to accumulate this per-
centage. There may be many reasons for
this locally, although this tends to be the
national feeling also. Harriman, Williams,
and Lausche are fairly sectional candi-
dates, not known or popular in the South.
Kefauver while better known does not
carry the popular vote here that he does
in some border and midwestern states.

It is the responsibility of students and
future citizens to carefully consider these
matters, for there is not only a need for
intelligent voters today, but a tremendous
and crying challenge for honest, and cap-
able candidates. Many questions are posed
by the present political scene. Think care-
fully, for your answer and your vote may
well be tomorrow’s government.—R.H.M.

Changing Views. POLITICAL HATS IN THE 1956 RING---A SYMPOSIUM

The recent political preference poll
conducted by the Davidsonian, which was
widely disseminated by the United Press.
invites comment and comparison with a
similar poll which was conducted by the
Davidsonian in the spring of 1952, six
months before the recent presidential elec-
tion.

There are certain fundamental dif-

ferences between the polls which should
be noted. Approximately one-half of the
student body or 417 students participated
in the most recent poll while 824 men or
virtually the entire student body took part
in the 1952 poll. In this respect the latter
poll could be considered as more repre-
sentative. On the other hand the 1952 poll
makes no provision for the votes of inde-
pendents or those who prefer “others.”
To the question, ‘Which party do you
prefer?” there is a marked difference in
the answers received. In 1952. 471 stu-
dents preferred the Republican Party
while only 353 preferred the Democratic
Party, whereas at the present time 177
students prefer the Democrats while only
168 prefer the Republicans. The most ob-
vious answer to this great difference is
that many students in 1952 didn't prefer
the Republican Party; they preferred
Eisenhower. Another possible answer. is
that there has been a fundamental ideol-
ogical shift in the student body from Re-
publican to Democratic leanings in four
years, and a third possibility is that the
results would not have been the same if
the entire student body had been polled.

In 1952 the Republicans most promi-
nently mentioned were Eisenhower, Mc-
Arthur, Stassen. Taft, and Warren. Of
these. three have been incapacitated by
illness, death, or old age. The two left,
however, are prominently mentioned in
the present poll. Those appearing on the
present list that did not appear in 1952
are Nixon, Knowland, Dewey, and Milton
Eisenhower. The most noticable change in
the Republican ranks is the emergence of
Nixon and Knowland as possible Repubii-
can standard bearers. Both Stassen and
Warren have more than doubled their
party popularity in four years. It would
seem that with the removal of the two.
giants, Eisenhower and Taft, the Republi-
cans have widely distributed their favor
with no candidate standing far ahead.

The most striking change shown by
the comparison is in the relative popu-
larity of Stevenson and Russell. In the
1952 poll 155 Democrats (44 percent) pre-
ferred Kefauver, and 150 (42 percent) se-
lected Russell, while Stevenson ran a very
poor third with only 42 students (12 per-
cent) picking him as their candidate. The’
current figures show an amazing change.
Now 73 students (42 percent) favor Steven-
son: 58 students (33 percent) pick Russell:
and Kefauver runs a poor third with 20
students (11.5 percent) selecting him. This
shows two things, a continued though
lessening support of Russell in a predomi-
nately Southern student body and a com-
plete reversal of the positions of Steven-
son and Kefauver.

Only Senator Kerr in addition to
these three was mentioned in 1952. A
large number of additions, however, are
found in the present list. These are Harri-
man, Symington, Lausche, and Mennen
Williams.

Sixty-five percent of the students are
undoubtedly right in believing that Presi-
dent Eisenhower will not run again. Even
the Republican-dominated Charlotte Ob-
server has stated editorially that Joe
Maftin and other Republican leaders who
would run Eisenhower despite his heart
attack are not only engaging in wishful
thinking but are in reality doing their
country a disservice by putting their party
above the national welfare. Their motive
of course ‘would be to dictate the future
President of the United States by party
controlled selection of a vice-presidential
candidate.

Unfortunately, eighty-four and five-
tenths percent of the students are prob-
ably right in asserting that Ike will win
if he seeks re-election. —T.W.W.

STEVENSON:

Humble Optimism

BY JIM MARSHALL

Adlai Stevenson is getting a new
deal for the 1956 Democratic presi-
dential nomination, and he is draw-
ing the high cards. The reshuffling
has given the Republican party
those low cards which he drew and
played with an aristocratic poker.

with the intelligentsia which is
identified with him as well as with
his wit which is the main bone of
contention of those who resent any-
thing above a pat answer or gen-
eralization.

Stevenson comes from a rich po-
litical tradition, One Grandfather

Party and the other was Vice-Pres-
ident during Grover Cleveland's
second administration. Although

HARRIMAN:

He Knows the Ropes

BY ED STEVENS

As election time draws near one
of the main topies of discussion
seems, quite naturally, to be “Who
do you think will run?” We hear
the Republicans mention such
names as Nixon, Warren, or Stas-
sen, although mostly as a second
choice, in the event that Eisen-
hower decides not to run again, On
the other side, the Democrats
speak of Stevenson, Russell, or. . .
Harriman.

It is this last prospective can-
didate about whom I probably
know the most, little as that may
be, for he is, at present, the gover-
nor of my home state—New York.

At about this time last year,
New York State had just elected
William Averell Harriman to head
its Executive Department. This was

—4 ai...

the result of a hotly contested elec-
tion, in which there was much mud
slinging and name-calling. both
from the Republicans, and from
the Democrats. Among the charges
brought against Mr. Harriman was
one to the effect that he had been
involved in a highly complex exam-
ple of graft and corruption on the
New York City waterfront several
years before.

I believe that it has really been
too short a time to pass judgment
on the merits on Mr. Harriman’s
role as New York’s Chief Execu-
tive, but one of his seemingly
more unwise maneuvers was
brought to light in the February
16 issue of “The Christian Cen-
tury,” in which he is spoken of as
using ‘one of the oldest shabbiest
tricks in the politician’s bag.” With-
out going into detail, I will have
to let it suffice to say that he, in a

Kefauver as a serious rival, is
waiting to make his move should
Stevenson falter, Stevenson, if he
expects to regain the nomination,
will necessarily have to enter most
of the primaries and will undoubt-
edly be opposed by Kefauver. Har-
riman, of course, is under no such
obligation to enter the primaries.

Stevenson will have to win de-
cisively in the primaries in order
to be nominated while a few Ke-
fauver victories would probably
give Harriman the chance to offer
himself, Kefauver’s nomination ap-
pears likely only in the event that
he should win in the primaries by
large majorities and in the’ event
that the public should back him so
wholeheartedly that the Democratic
bosses would be impelled to nomi-
nate him.

Too, Kefauver has: been men-
tioned as a possible running mate

statement concerning the legaliza-
tion of bingo, and. the action of
numerous Protestant and Jewish
religious leaders to try to prevent
this, was “deliberately trying to
create a false issue and playing for
support by rousing religious ani-
mosities,” It further stated that “in
the language of politics, this comes
under the head of dirty pool.”

Of course it must be said that
not all Mr. Harriman has done has
been in this vein, but that he has
done many things which seem to
be for the good of the state as a
whole, and it will be some time be-
fore we can accurately evaluate all
of his actions.

Now we find this man_ being
talked of as a possible candidate
for the Presidency of the United
States. In considering him we must
keep in mind that he is an able
politician, a strong leader, and one
who “knows the ropes” in political
circles, He has had much experi-
ence and training for such a posi-
tion. On the other hand, however,
we find that he ‘has a record that
is somewhat tainted in spots, that
some of his recent actions have
been of questionable merit, and
that he, in all probability, would
not receive a great deal of support
in some areas of our country, par-
ticularly the South.

KEFAUVER:

An 1829 Repeat?

BY ERNEST TAYLOR

Estes Kefauver, coonskin cap and
all, is off and running for the 1956
Democratic Presidential nomina-
tion, There are no doubts as to his
intentions. The other two top con-
tenders, Adlai Stevenson of Mlli-
nois and Governor Harriman of
New York, until only recently have
been playing coy and reluctant, but
the Tennessee Senator is in no wise
reluctant and it is plain that he is.
again in the running.

In 1952 Kefauver went to the
Democratic Convention with a bag
full of votes after having captured
fourteen of the sixteen states’ pref-
erential primaries. His victories
mattered little to the professionals
and big bosses who proceeded to
maneuver the nomination of Adlai
Stevenson, who had not actively
sought the nomination.

Kefauver’s position is one of
paradox. Though he is one of the
few Southerners since the Civil
War to gain more than provincial
support in a bid for the presiden-
cy, his own native South is the part
of the country that least wants him
as the Democratic nominee.

Moreover, his popularity in
Tennessee, normally regarded as a
typically Southern state, is all the
more unexplainable in light of his
all-round liberal record in  Con-
gress. He is usually consistent with
the ideals of the Democratic Party
on foreign policy, public power, and
social legislation, and his record is
perfect as far as organized labor
is concerned,

All his political innocence not-
withstanding, Estes Kefauver is not
without guile. Now on the eve of
the presidential preferential pri-
maries, the Senator’s subcommittee
is beginning its public hearings on
juvenile delinquency. His popu-
larity in 1952 was perhaps largely
attributable to his status as a tele-
vision celebrity.

for either Stevenson or Harriman.
The Senator’s presence would
strengthen such a ticket immeas-
urably though his feelings on the
matter are not known.

But at any rate, the common
people have a candidate, and it is
entirely possible that, as in 1829,
they may, to the dismay of the rul-
ing elite, swarm again into Wash-

NIXON:

Young and Enterprising

BY JACK KERR

The Vice-President of the United
States is forty-two years old, robust,
intelligent, conscientious, ruthless,
affable, articulate, competitive,
telegenic, and breathtakingly adapt-
able. He comes from a large state,
leads an apparently blameless per-
sonal life, has an attractive family,
has never been called a security
risk, and is blessed with many
friends and admirers — some of
whom, as we learned from the
campaign of 1952, have been will-
ing to invest solid cash in his po-
litical career.

He is a first-class influence right
now. In an administration headed
by a soldier and staffed by mer-
chants, he is the ranking politician
—despite the fact that he has been
in politics less than a decade, and.
five years before he was Vice-Presi-
dent was the subject of an article
in a Washington paper headed
“Greenest Congressman in Town.”

Nixon, at present, takes many
responsibilities in good spirits. He

NIXON

when one thinks of Nixon in re-
lation to the history of the past
three years, there is no single item
of substantive policy that one can
identify him with,

Policy, it would seem, is some-
thing in which Nixon has only a
mild, spasmodic interest. He can
take it or leave it alone. He does
not fear it and avoid commitment,
as a great many present day politi-
cians do. On the contrary, there
have been few public issues in his
time that he has failed to take a
stand on. But there is no descern-
able pattern to his commitments.

Why do I believe Nixon would
make a great President? As a per-
son and as a personality, he em-
bodies much that is held to be
precious by me—as well as by a
large and growing number of
Americans — especially in that
segment of the middle class to

WARREN:

Social Progress

BY STUART COLLINS

Any speculation upon the GOP
nominee for President must be
based upon the assumption that
Eisenhower will not run. f am mak-
ing this assumption in supporting
the Chief Justice of the United
States, Mr. Earl Warren. In my
opinion Mr. Warren has assets that
no other prospective candidate
possesses.

He has a record of public service
that few men can match. The son
of immigrant parents, Mr. Warren
triumphed over financial and social
adversity to attain his present po-
sition.

After passing the Cahfornia bar
exam he practiced private law only
a few years and then entered pub-
lic life. He has remained there to
the present day. His experience
encompasses all forms of govern-
ment service. He has been district
attorney, a member of the Cali-
fornia legislature, attorney general,
and is the only man in history to
be elected Governor of his state
three times. He served in this ca-
pacity for ten years: 1943-1953. In
the campaign of 1942 he carried the
Lieutenant Governor, the Secretary
of State and both houses of the
legislature with him. In 1946 he
won both the Democratic and Re-
publican nominations (under the

tional Security Council, presiding
over both in the President’s ab-
sences, which are frequent, ,He is
said to be the first Vice-President
ever to chair a Cabinet meeting,
and perhaps he is. He also attends
the President’s conferences with
legislative leaders. Perhaps at this
point you wonder why the preced-
ing has been mentioned—it only
seems too obvious that the United
States needs a man for President
who has the experience of an ad-
ministrator and the foresight of
an Asiatic-fortune teller.

Nixon is a firm advocate of Presi-
dent Eisenhower’s policies and
could better than anyone else see
that they were carried out, for he
possesses the necessary stamina
needed in rallying support on cer-
tain issues. It may well be that if
it were not for his loyalty and
strength, the Bricker amendment
or one of its variants would be
part of our fundamental law to-
day. He rallied and organized the
thin Republican opposition and
surreptitiously encouraged the
Democrats.

One of the unique things about
him is that he has achieved his
present eminence by concerning
himself exclusively with strategy,
and ignoring the whole broad field
of policy. It is astonishing that

California cross-filing system). In
these primaries he won 90 percent
of the GOP vote and 55 percent of
the Democratic vote. In 1950 he
defeated Jimmy Roosevelt. by more
than a million votes. His career
reached a new high when in 1953
he became Chief Justice of the
United States.

During the period of Warren’s
occupancy of the Governor’s Man-
sion, California’s Democratic regis-
tration outnumbered their Republi-
can neighbors by 3 to 2. The GOP
is a minority party in this country
and to win a national election they
must draw heavily on independent
and Democratic votes. It is my con-
tention that other than Eisenhower
there is no man in the party who
can draw this type of support out-
side of Earl Warren.

While he was Governor of Cali-

_ fornia the state’s population nearly

doubled. No other man in a com-
parable office has faced the prob-
Jem this man has faced. No other
governor in history has built so
many highways, schools and hos-
pitals. He raised the gasoline tax to
finance road construction, widened
unemployment insurance coverage,
reformed the prison system, and
three times tried unsuccessfully to
establish a compulsory state health
insurance program. At the present
time our nation faces many of

these same problems which Mr.
Warren has dealt with on the state
level.

He could not carry any southern
states after the recent decision but
these states seem to be returning
to the traditional fold at any rate.
Indeed, because of the recent de-
cision these states will return to
the Democratic party to maintain
ascendancy within the Party in
Congress. The old Taft wing will
be discontented with him complete-
ly but if the GOP wishes to survive
it must slowly cut out this element
anyway. The picture is further
complicated by the number of as-
pirants from California. What the
convention delegation from this
state will do is probably largely up
to Mr. Knight.

Mr. Warren-is a “middle of the
road” candidate and has only fost
one election (the 1948  nation-

al election when he ran_ with
Dewey). His philosophy is well
summed up in this statement: “I
am convinced the American people
wilt not tolerate Socialist govern-~
ment, but are definitely committed
to social progress.”

to pursue this matter further and
view the other side of the question
I refer them to the periodical The
Nation, October 10, 1953.

KNOWLAND:

Formosa to California

BY TOM HALL

Known as the “Senator from For-
mosa,” it is needless to say that
California Senator Knowland’s main
interest lies in foreign affairs—an
area of our government which shall
demand much time and extremely
tactful handling during these next
few years.

But more important than his
knowledge. of the Asiatic situation,
we readily see that Senator Know-
land's outstanding qualification is
his having been Senate Majority
Leader during the 83rd Congress
and now current Minority Leader.
This one fact alone gives him years
of valuable insight into govern-
mental organization and adminis-
tration along with cognizance of
the many responsibilities of the
executive branch of our govern-
ment as well as the legislative,

Knowland leaves no room for
doubt in his views on Asia and
Formosa. His strong pro-Chiang
Kai-Shek feelings earned the name,
“Senator from Formosa,” and his
forceful anti-Communist _ senti-
ments make his stand on the Asia-
tic issues commendable indeed.

Being appointed to an unexpired
senatorial term in 1945, Knowland
has proved himself in many ways
in addition to being Minority
Leader, Of his more important
achievements are Chairmanship of
the Republican National Executive
Committee (1941-42), rising from
Private to Major from 1942-45 in
the Army, successive elections to
the Senate (1946 and 1952), Armed
Services Committee (1951), Chair-
man of the Senate Republican
Policy Committee (1953), and cur-
rent membership in the Appropria-
tions and Foreign Relations Com-
mittee.

A very enviable quality of Sen.
ator Knowland is his straight-to-
the-point type of argument—some-
what similar to the late Bob Taft.
Knowland's few opponents are in
a continual state of despair in that
they are never able to “sling mud”
at him, as quite common in most
political campaigns, for he refuses
to employ deceitful or dishonest
means to accomplish his ends and
his integrity and character are un-
blemished.

Furthermore, we would have in
the Senator from California an ex.
cellent campaigner. His rugged,
fair and honest talking makes him
appeal to the public in much the
same way as Wendell Wilkie did.

Then being from California, he
would -not only have a populous
state behind him but his nomina-
tion would be indicative of our cur.
rent population shift away from the
Atlantic Seaboard. Teamed with an
Eastern mate, Knowland would
provide an excellent nominee.
