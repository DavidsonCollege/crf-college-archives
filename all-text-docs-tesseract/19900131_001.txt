By HEATH HARDAGE

Three years ago, a rela-
tively unknown musical
group-who-— billed them-
selves as the “Indigo Girls”
played here at Davidson
College. Amy Ray, one of the
two lead singers of the
group, commented, “We
played in the 900 Room, and
no one knew who we were.
People were kind of rude,
which was hard a =

with. ”

This past Friday, toi
ever, Indigo Girls did noten-
counter this problem. Hun-
dreds of screaming fans
filled Love Auditorium:

Ray observed that, “Once
people get to know who you
are, they listen.. -it felt really

students were there
with the show.”
“Closer To Fine,” “Land of
Canaan” and “Prince of
Darkness” are among the
group’s best-known songs.
The New York Times on
_ March 24, 1989, character-
ized their musical style by
saying: “Their earnest, liter-
ary folk music sounds like
Peter, Paul and Mary, the
New Seekers and an acous-
tic Jefferson Airplane all
Tolled into one and enriched
with the drone of their fel-

low Georgians R.E.M.”

“definitely rooted in folk

Emily Saliers, the other
half of the musical duo, is
“into soul stuff,” according
to Ray. She has also been
greatly influenced by Joni
Mitchell. Shawn Colvin, a
new artist on Columbia
Records, is a current favor-

Ray herself listens to “The

Rescuing and reconstructing
African-American history

president of the Karmic Guid-

Browder says he and others
are “essentially involved in the
rescue and reconstruction of
African and African-American
history and culture.” This is
particularly important since
Western society describes Af-
rica prior toEuropeaninvasion
as savage and uncivilized.

“It is important that we par-
ticipate in this process because
you find out it is the most dis-

torted and most often misun-
derstood history and culture of
any group of people in this
particular society,” he said. He
stressed the im-

Forum raises questions about
semesters’ work load, length

By SUZANNE CRAYMER

During the SGA forumon semesters, panel-
ists brought up several problems and pro-
posed some solutions. Members on the panel
included a student representative from each
class, Registrar Sue Ross and English Profes-
sor Gil Holland. The issues debated included
the length of semesters, the amount of mate-
rial due at the end and vacations.

Opinions on the length of semesters ranged
from keeping the current 15. week system to
shortening it by one and a half weeks. Some
students felt that the 15 week system enabled
them to learn more. “We're lucky to have a
long semester year,” said Sophomore Emily

options included shortening the semester inter-
nally by providing an easter break and more read-
“A church-affiliated school like
Davidson should naturally provide an Easter
break,” said Sissler.

The amount of material due during the semes-
ter’s last two weeks formed a large part of the
discussion. Everyone agreed that too much mate-

rial was due at that time. Junior Ellen Crawford

said, “A shorter semester could decrease
burnout and make classes more fun.” Other

brought up the problem of burnout. During the
change from three terms to semesters, Crawford
said that there an “unwritten understanding that
classes would be light that week.” Yet SGA Presi-

passed the vote [to semesters] we made some
promises and these have been violated.”
