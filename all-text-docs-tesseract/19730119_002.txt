EPC To Consider Proposed
Annual Freshman Symposium

By RICHARD ROMEYN
Contributing Editor
When the Educational Policy
Committee meets later this
month it will consider a
for a Freshman Sym-

posium. ;
The proposed symposium
would be required during the

fall term of all freshmen and
would focus upon five major

literary works, drawn from
diverse disciplines and
historical periods

According to Hansford Epes,
a member of the committee
which the symposium,
its would include the
humanities, social sciences,
natural sciences and the arts.

The symposium would
replace n Extended
Studies, and would be graded on
a pass-fail basis. Work done in
the symposium would also
fulfill the freshman com-

ition requirement.
P Under the proposal a fresh-
man class of 300 would be
divided into discussion groups
of 15 students each. Although
the basic reading would be stan-
dard for all groups, the
discussion leader would be free
to choose his approach and sup-
plement the material in any way
ne aithough Is ha
no materia ve
been selected, E said that
something from Rope and
something from reco-
Roman period would probably
be used.

Discussion groups would
meet out of doors, at a
professor's home, over lunch,
or in other informal settings as
well as in the classroom. He
called the symposium’s format
“planned informality”.

“It's important for the fresh-
men to become acquainted with
faculty members as people, not
just a sources of information,”
he said.

One of the primary goals of
the symposium would be to
provide a common experience
for all freshmen, and eventually
one that all upperclassmen and
faculty have also shared.

“It will provide at least a
minimal common language,”

said Epes, adding that he felt
the symposium would mean a
greater sense of community
among faculty and students.

“It will also help maintain the
sort ef interdisciplinary at-
mosphere which is vital to a
liberal arts environment,"’ he
said.

“The symposium would also
serve as an orientation to
college-level study in an at-
mos; that is intellectually
rigerous,"" Epes said. ‘The
freshman year is probably the
most important year in terms of
the educational experience one
get in subsequent years.’’ The
program would involve ex-
tensive practice in written and
oral discussion.

Epes sees the symposium as
not only a learning experience
for students but for faculty as
well. All faculty would par-
ticipate in the program over the
course of several years.

“It will give the faculty a
chance to participate in a com-
mon educational experience
and I think it would prove
beneficial for everyone who par-
ticipates,"* he said.

E admits that additional
f will be needed to make
the symposium a reality, but he
feels that the benefits of the
program would be worth the
cost. It may also be possible to
obtain foundation grants to
cover at least some of the ex-
penses.

There are also problems in-
volving scheduling courses
around the symposium. Epes
said that ‘*probably
everybody's chief worry con-
cerning the symposium is
teaching load complications."’
He suggests, however, that a
possible solution may involve
shifting some courses to the
spring term, or hiring ad-
ditional faculty.

Efforts would be made to
avoid duplicating material to be
covered in the humanities

sequences. To avoid conflict
between the symposium and
humanities, Epes suggests that
the humanities sequence be
moved back a term so that it
would begin in the winter of the
freshman year and end in the
fall of the junior year. —
Freshman symposiums or
seminars are part of the
curriculum at The College of
Wooster and Hirman College,
both in Ohio, and in other liberal
arts colleges across the coun-

try.

The program at Hirman is
even more extensive than that
planned for Davidson in that it
runs the duration of the entire
freshman year. nd

The immediate source of the
Freshman Symposium concept
was a North Carolina Com-
mission on Curricular Reform
attended by several Davidson
faculty this past summer.

Former Attorney General
Ramsey Clark is among par-
ticipants in the Symposium on
Corrections to be held here
January 22-24.

The three day program will
include several addresses, a

panel discussion, several
workshops, and two showings of
the film ‘Attica’.

Former Attorney General
Clark will speak twice during
the symposium. ‘‘We are very
fortunate to have Ramsey Clark
speak here,"’ Assistant Director
of the College Union Peter
Sterling said. ‘‘He has the
reputation of being one who is
very active in the reformation
of corrections."

Other speakers in the sym-
posium will be Frank Hall, a
member of the North Carolina
Commission of Corrections,
and John Cone, corrections
reformer and director of
Project Fisherman in Boston,
Mass.

‘Project Fisherman involves
work with imnates both in
prison and after being
released,’ Sterling said.

Hall will speak in place of
N.C. Commissioner of Correc-
tions Lee Bounds who is unable
to attend.

Both Hall and Cone will par-
ticipate in Tuesday's panel
discussion. George Daly, a
lawyer with the American Civil
Liberties Union, will also serve
as a panelist. Other panelists
will be Charlotte attorney Peter

and an inmate from one
of the N.C. corrections in-
Stitutions.

The hour and a_ half
workshops on Wednesday will
focus on specific’ problems in
the corrections system. Each
workshop will begin with a
short statement by the man
presiding over it, according to
Sterling. Then the workshops
will be open for discussion,
he said.

Inmates from N.C. in-
stitutions will be at all the
workshops to provide a balance
to the program, Sterling said.

Two of the workshops will
focus on issues of special im-
portance at this time. ‘‘The
question of the legal rights of
prisoners is an important new
field,’ Sterling said. William S.

Correction Symposium Here

McAninch, associate professor
of Law at the University of
South Carolina, who will direct
the workshop, has led a national
study on this subject.

Another workshop will deal
with the problem of juvenile
corrections, ‘This is especially
important in view of the fact
that one third of all crime in
North Carolina is committed by
people under 18,'’ Sterling said.

The symposium on Correc-
tions has been in the making
since January of last year. ‘‘We
anticipate a lot of community
response as well as college
response,’’ Sterling said.

The purpose of the sym-
posium is to give everyone ‘a

taste of what is needed in the
way of prison reform,'’ ac-
cording to Kent Nearing, a coor-
dinator of. the program.
‘Reform will never come until!
the general public is informed
about what corrections is all
about."’

Sterling called this sym-
posium ‘‘the biggest the college
has done in the last four or five
years."’ He also said that the
symposium is notable because
the YMCA, the SGA, the
Student Union, and the public
lectures committee are all
working together to fund the

program.

SGA Recommends
Split Winter Term

By TOM AINSWORTH
News Editor

The fate of Davidson's
curriculum calendar for the
1973-74 academic year has been
debated for the past two weeks
in the SGA.

In response to the proposed
Educational Policy Committee
calendar which places two ter-
ms after Christmas break the
SGA unanimously elected to
adopt a 4-6 split winter term
calendar in its last Tuesday
night meeting.

The advantages of the adop-
ted calendar include a
relatively early starting and
finishing date for the school
year, a Christmas vacation
from December 21 to January 7,
and a Spring vacation of almost
two weeks.

Drawn up by the Educational
Affairs Committee of the SGA,
the proposed new calendar is
due to come before the EPC for
evaluation in the next week.

Also of significant interest at
the Senate's January 9 meeting
was the report by Steve
Shepherd and John Weathers on
a student legal rights handbook.

The two seniors, who at-
tended a student rights com-
ference in Atlanta over Christ-
mas, want to concentrate on
student property rights and

‘Arbitrary
grading on
professors."

The report should be
available by the end of Winter
term.

Rick Damewood's Course
Evaluation Handbook, also
reported on in the same
meeting, should be completed
in ‘the near future’’ according
to its editor.

An SGA questionnaire per-
taining to the necessity for
either a ‘‘Wildcat Handbook" or
‘“Quips and Cranks’’ was
reviewed in last Tuesday's
meeting.

The questionnaire will decide
student support for either
publication and help to ascer-
tain the budget of both depen-
ding on a favorable response.

Senator Doug _ Sitler's
proposal for an information
committee, comprised of up-
perclassmen who are
knowledgeable in the ad-
ministrative power system,
went undiscussed last Tuesday
night.

The group would be able to
“plot political strategy against
the Administration” and ‘‘in-
Struct others on the hierar-
chical power structure” so as to
help students interested in star-
ting a project but ignorant in
the ways of establishing it,
explained Sitler.
