DAVIDSON NINE CONTIN-
UES TO LEAD IN
BIG FIVE RACE

THE SPORTS PARADE

FLEAGLE AND COCHRAN
SET NEW RECORDS
IN MEET SATURDAY

RA CASKIE NORVELL 28.

In spite of the surprise defeat at the
hands of N, C. State, the Davidson dia-
mond aggregation is still on top in the
state championship race. Carolina's time-
ly frapping of Wake Forest did ,the
trick. Davidson has a half-game lead
over the Deacons, with State, Duke, and
Carolina trailing in the order named.

This week the ’Cats go on a four-game
foreign invasion, which will bring them into
contact with Lenoir-Rhyne and Hampden-
Sydney, once each, and twice with the Gob-
blers of V. P. I. Coach Lard’s proteges
will return to their own back lot Friday to
take. on the much talked of Demon Deacons
of Wake Forest, who will present a strong
team, with none other than Junie Barnes to
do the mound work.

The editor regrets the errors in the
batting averages, and wishes to assure
members of the team it was a staff error,
made by one uninitiated in the art of
baseball scoring, who actually counted in
the walks as times at bat. In the future
the editor will take care of that column
personally, and promises no further mis-
takes.

Davidson’s freshman ball club hits the
road this week for a four-game campaign.
Games are booked with the Louisburg Col-
lege nine, and freshman teams from Caro-
lina, State, and Wake Forest. Unger’s boys
came‘out of a slump, and have knocked off
three victims in a row, and look plenty good.
. That Jenkins lad turned ita three-hit game
against Charlotte High.

Yours truly, ye editor, in addition to
the rest of the. college, takes this oppor-
tunity to say “nice going” to Fred
Fleagle and Miller Cochran, who set new
college records in the 220-yard dash at
21.6, and 134 feet in the discus, respect-
ively, in the meet with South Carolina
Saturday. Fleagle broke Currie’s record
of long standing by one-fifth of a sec-
ond.

Earle Frazier, freshman miler, stepped out
in the meet with the P. C. neophytes, and
ran a mile in 4:36.9, to not only better the
Davidson varsity record, but to shatter the
South Carolina state record in this event.
He also took first in the 880-yard run.

Davidson’s golf team broke even in a
series of matches played away from
home last week, dropping matches to W.
& L. and William and Mary, while win-
ning over N. C. State and the strong
University of Richmond linksmen. Wag-
ner, through absences, will be lost to the
team for the rest of the year.

The varsity tennis team followed two se-
vere trouncings by Carolina and Navy by
winning three straight last week, The vic-
tims were Washington and Lee, William and
Mary, and The Citadel. The last named
match marked the return to the team of
Johnny: Lafferty, who has not been ablé to
participate in the other matches on account
of an overabundance of cuts.

Inter-fraternity ball has gotten under
way with Sigma Phi Epsilon defeating
the S. A. E. boys in the first game, and
the Pi Kappa Alpha team knocking off
the Betas in the only other game played
to date. In the race for the inter-fra-
ternity athletic trophy, Beta Theta Pi is
tied with the Pi K. A.’s for first place.

Charlie Harris’ return to the baseball team
will greatly strengthen the pitching staff.
Charlie cut church too many times and has
been on restrictions, which kept him off the
last trip. Shrimp Morris is also on restric-
tions, but is due to be off Saturday. In the
meantime, Bruce Peabody, slugging left-
fielder, is holding down first base in great
shape.

Davidson Leads by Four-Run Margin
Until Fourth Inning

It took the Wolfpack of N.C. State to up-
set the dopesters and hand the Davidson
Wildcats their first licking by a college team
this season. State came from behind in a
game played in Raleigh last Wednesday to
defeat the ’Cats, 9 to 6.

As the fourth canto opened, Davidson en-
joyed a 6 to 2 lead, with Baily on the mound.
However, State scored seven runs in the
next three innings, one of these being a
home run by Duke, who hit for the circuit
with the sacks loaded in the sixth, The
four markers brought in by this blow proved
to be the margin of victory for the East
Raleigh team.

The ’Cats used three hurlers in an at-
tempt to halt the State onslaught, while
Seitz went the route for the Techmen.

My Greatest Thrill

AS TOLD BY FRED FLEAGLE

My greatest thrill came in this year’s
game with Wofford. I was playing half-
back when the signals called me. for a_line
sneak.
and the first thing I knew the offense had
cleared Wofford’s players from the field, and
I was able to carry the ball forty-seven
yards that stood between Davidson~and-a
touchdown, As this was on the second play,
it came as a surprise to me, furnishing my
greatest thrill in football,

Fred Fleagle, fleet halfback, is a senior
and captain of the Davidson track team, the
century and the furlong being his special-
ties. In the recent Davidson-South Caro-

in the 220, at 21.6 seconds. He made his let-
ter in football this year. |

With this statement by Fred Fleagle, this |
column comes to a close until next year, |
when “The Davidsonian” hdpes to publish a |
similar series of statements from such titans
of the gridiron as Charlie Rives, Eb Willson,
Percy McElrath, and others of the Junior
class who make varsity letters.

| GAME AT CHAPEL HILL
| First Two Encounters, Won by Scores
of 4 to'3

The Davidson Wildcats made a clean
sweep of their three-game series with the
Tar Heel diamondmen of the University of
North Carolina by winning the final game
at Chapel Hill last Tuesday afternoon, 8
to 7. In two previous encounters the ’Cats
came out on top of 4 to 3 scores,

The Wildcats were outhit fifteen to four-
teen, and used three pitchers to Carolina’s
two, but bunched their hits in the pinches
to win. Julian West, who relieved Pearce
in the sixth, got credit for winning the ball
game.
| Carolina opened strong, and held a 3 to 0
lead as the fourth rack opened, but the Da-
| vidson sluggers got into action and scored
| four runs in this inning to go into a lead,
{never to be headed again. Powell, Tar Heel
third baseman, had: a perfect day at bat,
| bingling three out of three. J. G. Morrison
jled Davidson's sluggers with three for four.
