You get twice as much for
your money in-an-Alpagora,
for the simple reason that
this coat is unusually soft
and luxurious to the touch
— and yet — unusually
rugged and long-wearing!
For on the face of every,
‘square inch of Alpagora
fabric, you find twice the
usual number of hair fibres,
That's what textile scientists
call a Double-Dense fabric
... a fabric which féels
