‘Jungle’s’ Owner Dies;
New Emporium Needed

BY TOM LOFLIN
Davidsonien Feature Editor

Legends are born when men die. It is‘ only in the rarest of cases that legends
about a man live and flourish within the realm of his life.

The town and college of Dav-
idson participated in one of his-
tory’s rare results of the com-
dination of a man and a legend
for the past seventeen years.
The man left last Saturday
morning; the legend will live on.

‘Rev. William C. (Pop) Cope-

land spent his last seconds in the .

shop on Main Street that must
forever remain a part of the
legend that began to grow up
about him long ago. It was per-
haps fitting that a heart attack
should peacefully snuff out the
seventy-two year old spirit of
life that dwelt in him in the
surroundings he loved the best.

Today his midget-sized en
porium continues to bulge
with its amazing ceche of com-
modities for every use ima-
ginable to a student or towns-
man. Only one change has
been made—the door is closed
and Pop Copeland is no longer
holding his continual conver-
sations in front of the store
with Davidsoniens and other
passers-by. With the warm
spring weather now in sight,
the town will just not be the
same without him in front of
his store.

It was not long after Pop
Copeland returned to Davidson
to spin his life away weaving
happifiess for other folks that
his legend began to grow on
campus. The most prominent
aspect of the legend was his
shop, in which so many varieties
of products in the dry goods line
were stored that students soon
gave it the name of ‘The Jun-

gle ”

And a lush jungle it was for a
freshman who may have arrived
for the administration's Hades
of orientation without a few
things that the college bulletin
for newcomers had “forgotten”
to mention. But’ Pop Copeland
had not forgotten to stock them.

To supplement the inade-
quately harsh light the school
had provided for his desk, the
eyeball-conscious frosh could al-
ways find lamps of softer elec-
trical tones. Just in case the
bultetin had not mentioned that
MS I's were expected to shine
their shoes and brass for every
ROTC drill, Pop had quite a
stockpile of Blitz cloths, shoe
polish, and Brasso.

{

He had just about every-

thing else, too, from boots for
the bootless caught in one of
Davidson's freak snowstorms
to buttens for Davidson men
who could do their own
mothering and knew how to
sew. As he said one time, “I
know what the boys need and
cater to their needs.”

Pop Copeland did not open
his store here in 1046 merely
to help freshmen the adminis-
tration had confused. He also
came to help the troubled in
spirit, the confused in mind.
Anytime a student needed a
sympathetic ear, the former
minister was happily willing to
lend his.

Or if it was just cheerful con-
versation a person wanted that
would be a bit more interesting
than college lectures, The Jun-
gle was the place to go. Pop
Copeland was always a beaming
conversationalist with an inter-
esting knowledge of Davidson in
the old days.

Pop got his start into the
big life right here when he
graduated with the Class ‘16.
He naturally could recite tales
by the jungle full to any in-
terested listener. He used to
love to tell how it was the
decision of all the classes back
in 1915 that led to the found-
ing of THE DAVIDSONIAN,
and not just thet of the Cless
of ‘15 which usustly takes
credit for the achievement.

One’ little-known fact about
him that often escapes his leg-
end is that he was the person

who suggested the inscription
on his class’ gift, the college
well. But his three Latin words,
“Labora ut Vincas” (Labor to
Conquer), can still be seen to-
day at the base of the fountain
in the well.

Another part of Pop Cope-
land’s legend, his plump, jolly
wife who has the reputation of
being the best cook in this end
of the county, continues to live
on in the flesh. And she will
continue to run her boarding
house in front of the campus
next to the old hotel. She has
now attracted quite a following
of independents who eat their
every meal of the week, except
for Saturday supper, with her.

Wheat will happen to The
Jungle is stilt not known by
Yhe family at the present
time. They feel that the town
still has a definite need for
the store since it carried
many low-priced items that at-
tracted the fectory workers
and Negroes of Davidson as
well as its college students.

Right now the decision is to
try to find someone who wants
to run it. But there are doubts
in the family's minds that any-
one who can run The Jungle as
cheaply as Pop Copeland did
can be found.

But whether The Jungle re-
mains closed or not, Pop Cope-
land’s myth will live on in the
minds of men in the town and
college.

For men are meant to die;
legends live on.

Vags Give Hootenanny;
Storyteller To Perform

BY TOM PEADEN
Davidsonian Staff Writer

Hodson Hall will be the scene of a “Hootenanny,” featuring Richard Chase on

March 21.

Chase is an American folk-
lorist and storyteller. His main
interest has been in collecting,
learning, and retelling the folk
tales that are a part of the oral
tradition of the people who live
in the southern Appalachians.

Some of these folk tales have
their origin in pre-Elizabethan
England. Chase has also publish-
ed several collections of these
tales in such books as Grand-
father Tales, Jack Tales, and
American Folk Tales and Songs.

In addition to Chase's telling
of the folk stories, several of
the janitors will present acts.
Heywood Good has a ventrilo-
quism act; Cleve Carr and Fred
Dees will sing Negro blues of
the Twenties; and Henry With-
ers will “butt-dance.”

Also on the program will be
singing by Davidson students
and possibly two students from
Duke. Because of the extremely
informal nature of the ‘Hoot-
enanny,” anyone can participate,
and those interested should con-
tact Alex Bernhardt.

Following the program, re-
freshments will be served, and
Chase will talk informally with
students, especially those inter-

nominees was narrowed to three
in the first day’s voting. Accord-
ing to election rules, the candi-
dates polling a collective ma-
jority survive.

McGuirt, Spratt, and Tram-
mel! will each give a_ short
speech on Monday morning,
with more extensive discussion
of the issues coming on Monday
night in the Union at 7 p.m.
Voting will resume on Tuesday.

Nine freshmen survived from
a field of 42 aspirants in Wed-
nesday’s voting for secretary-
treasurer. Four were carried
over from yesterday's close run-
off.

Only 18 sophomores chose to
run in Wednesday’s election for
vice-president with six of them
making the run-off yesterday.
This group was narrowed to
three from which today’s win-
ners were chosen.

When asked about the first
week's turnout of voters, Paul
Duvall, chairman of the elec-
tions board, remarked, “It’s
sure less than we'd hoped for!”
However, both Duvall and Dan-
ny Carrell, president of the
student council, were pleased
with the new ID voting cards.
Balloting has been made quicker
and easier with the cards, which
are being used for the first time
this year.

“I think they’re going to work
our real well,” Duvall said, ‘‘but
I was hoping the novelty of
them might encourage more
people to vote.” Less than 600
cards have been handed out.
Duvall also said that students
who have not secured voting
cards yet can still pick them up
from him even though the vot-
ing has already started.

Nominations for the Honor
Court will be made early next
week. The voting for these can-
didates will begin following the
elections of student body offi-
cers. Each class will elect two
members to the Honor Court.

The following week, the vot-
ing will be for YMOA officers,
publications heads, freshman ad-
viser, and Student Union presi-
dent.

Serving on the Elections
Board throughout elections are
the following: Paul Duvall,
Chairman; John McElfresh, Phil
Kraemer, Joe Martin, Charlie
Sasser, Joe Ansley, Larry Leaf-
er, Sam Clark, Mac Campbell,
Mac Smyth, Charlie Wherry,
John Oehler, Bernard Swope,

in writing dramas based on
themes contained in the folk-
lore of this period.

About future events of this
nature, Robert Sailstad, chair-
man of the Vagabonds Planning
and Governing Board, said, “In
terms of the response to the
“Hootenanny,” there might be a

and would take about six weeks

HAPPY TALK

As we all know, conversation is terribly important on a date.
When lulls in the conversation run longer than an hour or two,

one’s partner is inclined to

grow logy—even sullen. But oc-

casionally one finds it difficult to keep the talk going, eapecially
when one is having a first date with one. What, then, does one do?
-_If one is wise, one follows the brilliant example of Harlow
Thurlow. ,

Harlow Thurlow prepares. That is his simple secret. When
Harlow is going to take out a new girl, he makes sure in advance
that the conversation will not languish. Before the date, he
goes to the lib and reads all 24 volumes of the encyclopedia
and transcribes their contents on his cuffs. Thus he makes sure
that no matter what his date’s intereats are, he will have ample
material to keep the conversation alive.

Take, for example, Harlow’s first date with Priscilla de
Gasser, a fine, strapping, blue-eyed broth of a girl, lavishly
constructed and rosy as the dawn.

Harlow was, as always, prepared when he called for Priscilla,
and, as always, he did not ¢ cart to converse immediately. First
he took her to dinner because, as everyone knows, it is useless
to try to make conversation with an unfed coed. Her attention
span is negligible. Also, her stomach rumbles so loud it is diffi-
e yourself heard.

So he took her to a fine atenk house where he stoked her with
gobbets of Black Angus and mounds of French fries and thick-

ets of escarole and battalions of petit fours. Then, at last,
dinner was over and the waiter brought two finger bowls.

“I hope you enjoyed your dinner, my dear,” said Harlow,
dipping into his finger bowl.

“Oh, it was dy-dandy!” said Priscilla. ‘(Now let’s go
someplace for ribs.’’

“Later, perhaps,” said Harlow. “But right now, I thought
we might have a conversation.”
“Oh, goody, goody, two-shoes!” cried Priscilla. “I been
looking everywhere for a boy who can carry on a intelligent

conversation.”
“Your search is ended, madam,” said Harlow, and pulled
likely topic to

back his sleeves and looked at his cuffs to pick a
start the conversation.

Oh, woe! Oh, lnckaday| Those cuffe on which Harlow had
painstakingly transoribed so many facts—those cuffe on which

e had noted such diverse and fascinating information—those
cuffa, I say, were nothing now but a big, blue blur! eer Harlow

his cuffs wet and the ink had aun and not one word was legible!
And Harlow—poor Harlow!—looked upon his cuffe and broke
out in a night sweat and fell dumb.

“JT must say,” said Priscilla after several silent hours, “that
you are a very dull fellow. I’m leaving.”

With that she flounced away an | poor Harlow was too
crushed to protest. Sadly he sat and sadly lit a cigarette.

All of a sudden Priscilla came rushing back. ‘“Was that,” she
asked, “‘a Mariboro you just lit?”

Yes,” said Harlow.

“Then you are not a dull fellow,” she cried, and
