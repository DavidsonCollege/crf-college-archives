esnsdorf,

Jadwin and James think about Davidson?

By RAFAEL SANCHEZ-
ABALLI

Along with 379 freshman,
Davidson College opened its
doors to 23 new professors this
year.

Three of these are Arnold
James, Knight Faculty Fellow
and assistant professor of psy-
chology; Peter Ahresnsdorf,
assistant professor of political
science and humanities; and
Lisa Jadwin, visiting assistant
professor of English.

The newcomers have al-

Southerner. A native of Co-
lumbia, South Carolina, he is a
graduate of the University of
South Carolina. At U.S.C. he
earned a bachelor’s degree in
psychology and health educa-
tion and a master’s degree in
public health education.

James is currently working
on his doctoral dissertation,
“The Psychology of Anger As
It Relates to the Development
of Hypertension.”

James is a clinical psycholo-

gist, a branch of psychology
that focuses on abnormal be-
havior.

According to James, one rea-
son he chose this field is be-
cause he “loves talking to
people and getting paid for it.”

James comes to Davidson as
a Knight Faculty Fellow -— a
minority retention fellowship.
In psychological jargon, he de-
scribes Davidson as “a very
good person-environment fit.”

Born in the Philippines,

Ahrensdorf was raised in
Washington, D.C. He received
his bachelor’s degree from
Yale University and moved to
the University of Chicago to
begin his post-graduate work.
He taught at Kenyon College
in Ohio while finishing his dis-
sertation, “The Conflict Be-
tween Political Philosophy
and Religion As It Is Investi-
gated in Plato’s Phaedo.”
Alternating between Eng-
lish, Spanish and German dur-
ing an interview, Ahresndorf

said he wasn’t “thrilled” about
the idea of coming to a small
town. He repeatedly men-
tioned “the emphasis on teach-
ing at Davidson” and com-
mented upon the “open rela-
tionship between teachers and
students.”

Jadwin is a native of Califor-
nia. After receiving her bache-
lor’s degree at the University
of California at Davis, she mi-
grated to the East Coast for her
post-graduate studies.

Jadwin received her doctor-

ready expressed a
their first impres-
sions of Davidson
students. James
characterizes them
as “people who are
aware of their
thoughts and _feel-
ings and very confi-
dent in communi-
cating them.”

“They seem very
astute and good-hu-
mored,” added
Ahresnsdorf. After
her first few weeks
here, Jadwin com-
mented that
“Davidson students
are extremely well-
prepared in general
and for class.”

Of these three
professors, only
James isa legitimate

a “<

Peter Ahresnsdorf, political

science/humanities:

Davidson students
“seem very astute

and good-humored.”

Lisa Jadwin, English:
“Davidson students are
extremely well prepared,
in general
and in class.”

Arnold James, psychology:
Davidson students are
“people who are aware of
their thoughts and feelings’: |...p'
and very confident in
communicating them.”

~ ate from Prin-
ceton Univer-
sity -- in her dis-
sertation she
studied the “re-
lationship be-
tween fiction ,
writing and
lying.”
Davidson is
Jadwin’s first
professional as-
signment. She
came because
of the “atmos-
phere” and the
fact that it is a
“teaching-ori-
ented” school.
Jadwin appro-
priately de-
scribed her de-
partment. as
ivrelaxed ,.and.,
congenial.”
