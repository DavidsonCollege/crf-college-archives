10—The Davidsonian— October 3, 1980

Brick Brothers and Doughboys tell us, ‘Here’s some stuff.’

By THE BRICK BROTHERS
and THE DOUGHBOYS

A long time ago, in a galaxy
far, far away, there existed an
institution of higher learning
nestled in the foothills of Depu-
ty Dawg’s house. To the local
townfolk, this small, coeduca-
tional, liberal arts school was
known as Docile Unic Institute,
or DUI for short. Deeyooeye
had been founded on the noble
premise ‘‘Let self-selection flou-
rish where fraternities have
fallen."

The president, I.M. Oblivi-
ous, tried to keep in touch with
the students by holding meet-

.ings with them once every
decade. These meetings, called
“‘clused-ends”’ were at first held
once a week. But no one ever
attended and they became less
and less frequent. The word
from the President was that he
needed more time to prepare,
but only Joby believed that.

The students at Deeyooeye
were all quite studious. It was
said that once, they acted
almost like normal people but
that being in the library too
long had changed them. And
the library was a sight to see. It
was seventy-seven stories high.
The bottom floor was an 11,000
seat arena where the Deeyooeye
College Bowl team competed. It
was the only ‘‘sport’”’ left at the

Institute. The ‘‘real’’ sports had
been given up long before. It
didn’t matter because no one
ever went. to the games. Ten
years after all sports had been
withdrawn, President I.M Obli-
vious was quoted as saying, ‘‘I
am appalled to hear that Dee-
yooeye doesn’t have sports.’”’
And so on.

The social life at the Institute
wasn’t much. Students went to
ice cream socials and discos
where they got Strobe light
sundaes and Donna Summer
double dips. The old fraternities
had fallgn by the wayside when
the new eating building, The
Giant Mudslide, had been built
large enough to feed the entire
Western hemisphere. Ten years

after it was built, President
Oblivious said, ‘I didn’t know
we had a new eating building.”
And so forth.

The Dean of Students, B.E.
Sensitive, was well-liked by all.
The only rough part of his job
came on weekends during ice
cream discos. The intense cold
from the parties would send the
freezing townfolk running for
their thermo-nuclear supposi-
tories. Dean Sensitive (or B.E.
as he liked students to call him)
would have to make Deputy
Dawg go to the parties to turn
down the Pistachio. When final-
ly reached for comment, Presi-
dent Oblivious stated, ‘‘I didn’t
know we had a Deputy Dawg.”

Director of Housing, M.T.

Dorm, was in charge of putting
all the students in rooms.
Deeyooeye had had a housing
problem for many years. How-
ever, the Institute had spent
millions of dollars to build new
housing facilities. Now they had
too much room. It was a real
crisis and colleges and universi-
ties the world over were talking
about Deeyooeye’s dilemma.
When asked his opinion, Presi-
dent Oblivious took off his
glasses and announced, ‘‘I
didn’t know we had dorms.”
_Deeyooeye couldn't last.
Soon the students became too
smart for the teachers and
classes stopped. Everybody left
and the institute closed down.
All except for President Oblivi-

ous’ office. The last anyone saw
of him, he was heading toward
one of his ‘‘closed-end’’ mee-
tings to talk to the students.
Wonder if he’s still there?

This week in IMAC—the
Pikes beat some freshmen 53-7
and the SAE steamroller demo-
lished the SPE’s by the same
score, despite Barry Mack’s
opening play score. Those are
the only games that mattered.
Zombies jumped to #1 in this
week’s poll with Joby’s party a
distant second. Nancy, Ellen,
and a Doughboy need dates for
Homecoming. Connie got a
cavity; Clone got muddy; Dum-
bo missed three flights but
finally got home. Hey tarbaby,
how ‘bout them Fijis?
