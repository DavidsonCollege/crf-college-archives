Field Hockey suffers
tough losses _

Last week was not a very good
week for the Davidson Wildcats field
hockey team. They dropped games to

can Univer-

Wake Forest 9 fy to, bring

loss at Appa-
jachian State
last Monday, which the ‘Cats will have
an opportunity to avenge later this
month, the team traveled to Winston-
Salem on Thursday to take on Wake

Forest. The Deacons were ready for
them, and won 9-0 in the most lopsided
loss of the season thus far for the ‘Cats.

Davidson hoped to rebound on
Saturday, when they hosted American
in an afternoon contest. The effort was
there, but the Wildcats simply ran into
a strong team in American and fost 6-1
in a hard-fought game. The ‘Cats’ lone
score came off an impound play with
just over seven minutes left. The goal
was impressive, but it was too little too
late.

Next week the Wildcats will look
to improve upon their season record
with a pair of tough road games on
Friday and Saturday at Virginia and
Columbia, respectively. These games
are the first of a long road trip that also
includes games at Villanova, Davis and
Elkins and the University of Richmond.
