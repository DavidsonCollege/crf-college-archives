“Al” Reese and Captain Hengeveld was
the feature ofthe game.

ternational Mind.” This contest was held
to choose Davidson’s representative for
the State contest at Raleigh. in the

Fifteen boys remained on the Hill dur-
ing the Christmas holidays. Although

were numerous parties at the homes of |
the residents of Davidson to which they |
were invited. They were invited to a!
Christmas tree at Shearer Hall on the!
23rd and their stockings were bountifully |
filled with candy and tokens.

Dr. J. M. McG€onnell gave a very in-
teresting lecture fast Friday night in the
History class room on “America and the
New Epoch.” The address was very
much enjoyed by his audience. The lec-
ture was under the auspices ofthe Polity
Club.

The student body was pleased to hear
on their return after the Christmas holi-
days, that ground was being broken for
the purpose of erecting a new water tank.
The new tank is to be 24 feet high by 21
feet wide and is to have a capacity of
80,000 gallons,

lege and Davidson. Four representa-
tives from each of the literary societies
will mect'in the finals to decide the win-
ners of the honor. The tryouts for the
Roanoke debate will be held at the same
time. The query for both debates is as
follows: “Resolved, that employers and
employees should be compelled to settle
their—disputes by arbitration.” | David-
son will take the negative in both cases.

The sophomores have announced that
their toastmaster for the annual banquet
to be held in Charlotte in the near future
will be R. O. Harris. He was elected in
a recent meeting of the class.

At a meeting of the “D” club several
nights ago, fifteen men were awarded
letters in football. R. B. Walker was
elected captain-elect for next year.

Upon returning to the campus after
the Christmas holidays, the student body
was shocked to hear of the death of W.

infirmary,

heels,” the state champions of 1925. It
is comparatively young, being only four
seasons old. It was given two years ago
by a generous jewelry establishment of
Greensboro, to be held each year by the
standing champions of the Tarheel state.
The first year the coveted trophy was
held by Carolina, the second year by
Wake Forest, the third year by Carolina
again, and now it is in the possession of
the Wildcats, the present champions of
North Carolina.

The trophy is an exact duplicate of a
regular football in size and shape, but is
made of silver instead of the customary
pigskin. On it is engraved the names of
the various colleges by whom the trophy
has been held, the last of which is that
of Davidson.

Heating Plant of
Eu Hall Disrupted

The Eu Hall heating plant, put out of
commission earlier in the year, is de-
stined to remain so for some weeks to
come. Not long after cold weather set in
someone accidentally built a fire in the
Eu Hall furnace without turning on the
water first, with tho result that the
boiler was badly cracked.

During the holidays, just after the
parts for the damaged plant had come,
the same mistake was made in the Phi
Hall, and*the plant there rendered “hors
de combat” too. As the “Y” rooms need
heat every day, it was decided that the
latter plant should be repaired first and
that in the Eu Hall left until additional
parts can be ordered.’ The plants are
identical, having been put in at the same
time, during last year, so the exchange
of parts could be readily made.
