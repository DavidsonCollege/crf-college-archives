Coincidences With Other Davidson
Men Connected With Early Life

By GEORGE GULLETTE

In 1911 Edward Bruce Peabody was born
in a small village, Iva, South Carolina.
When Bruce was a baby, he was so small
that they carried him on a pillow. Once,
while his nurse was carrying him, he rolled
off, fortunately on his mother’s lap, but un-
fortunately on his head. Perhaps that ex-
plains a lot of things.

Connected with his native town is a
strange coincidence; it happens that he and
Ansley Watson were brought up by the
same negro mammy. Neither knew_of_this
until last Thanksgiving when Bruce vis-
ited Anderson, S. C., and was greeted with,
“Lawd, dere’s Bruce, growed up now!’
Ansley’s father was the Peabody’s family
doctor, and Reverend Peabody was, in turn,
the Watsons’ pastor, christening © little
Ansley. :

Soon after Bruce's birth, his family moved
to Darin, a spot in the swamps of Georgia.
There he went to kindergarten with Andy
and Mac Manson. Bruce did not know
Mac’s identity until his father recognized
his name on a freshman basketball tourna-
ment program.

Bruce went through the gamut of all
childhood experiences threefold. He had a
combination of adventurous spirit, mean-
ness, and strength that would make Huckle-
berry Finn and Tom Sawyer look like a
couple of sissies day-dreaming.

Moving to Jefferson and thence to Sugar
Greek, his family finally settled temporarily
in Tugaloo, Georgia, the “ham and eggs
town.” That is indeed way back in the
country for no inhabitants can be found
for miles around; Surely afl Davidson men
have heard how Bruce, clad less than scant=
ily, when confronted by some hostile hounds,
tore out through a briar patch to a river
and raced a water moccasin 200 yards to
the other shore; Bruce’s baseball ability is
probably the result of his early training in
cow pasture games,

He truly led a pastoral life, and regularly
went to the river for the cows and milked
them in the mornings. He claims that the
statement that cows give milk is false, for
they do not give milk; you have to take it
away from them.

Bruce and his brother Morris went with
their father.to visit another parish,
the boys delighted in the company of some

lad who could chew like Buck Mills. They
indulged in the fascinating art and their
father needed no explanations for their

paleness and’why they could not talk, much
They have been total abstainers
since then.

less eat.

His family then moved to Conyer’s, Geor-
gia, where Bruce took up with a disreputable
crony and the two were inseparable as well
as unstoppable. Their teacher sent them to
the principal every day to be whipped, but
the two won his good favor and were en-
tertained by baseball stories instead. On
one occasion, when his*mother was enter-
taining the Ladies’ Aid Society, he and his
running mate made an assault on what was
to be the refreshments. No ice cream was
had by the guests that day, much to his
mother’s mortification,

But he lived through it all, and after a
bit of preparation. at Alexander Graham
Junior High in Charlotte, he went through
Central High, where he was elected vice-
president of the student body.

In the fall of 1929 he entered Davidson,
a slim, hardy, ambitious freshman, weighing
only 120 pounds. He is among those celebri-
ties who roomed on the fourth floor of East,
where no studying was done, but there was
plenty of social life. He was one of the
conspirators against nearsighted Jack Mat-
thews, who ate half the gravy bowl before
realizing it was not soup. Nevertheless,
Bruce’s ability and popularity resulted in his
election to the presidency of the Freshman
class, which pointed him out as a future
leader at Davidson,

His summers have been spent partly at
the R. O. T. C. camp in Anniston where he,
Brooke Allen, and “Chuck” Wright were
particularly fast companions. Bruce has
been promoted to Cadet Captain in the Da-
vidson R. O. T. C. The other part of the
summer he tarried in the country near
Charlotte, and, pardon if I have seemed to
make a renegade of Bruce, leaving out those
more amiable parts of his character. His
chief hobby is bird dog raising, and is he
successful? The pedigreed dog he started
with has now nurtured twenty-five pups.
Bruce relates that once while teaching his
dogs to retrieve a ball, he wished for a bird
with which to give them more ° realistic

training, and lo, a dead dove dropped no
less than a yard from his side. Shall we
call Bruce a child of Providence or a liar?

But now let us look at Bruce crowned
with the success he deserves, and recognized
by his schoolmates as a leader and man of
solid character. The slim 120-pound fresh-
man was later elected captain of the var-
sity basketball team and in his senior year
the “Smiling Parson” was awarded a gold
football as the best blocker on the football
eleven. He also twice made letters in base-
ball, but his athletic ability only accom-
panied an interesting and attractive person-
ality that gained success for him as a stu-
dent leader and eventually the presidency
of Omicron Delta Kappa. He also served
as vice-president of the student body.

Wildkittens Win From
Central High Here 3-1 |

With Jenkins turning in a three-hit per-|
formance on the mound, the Wildkittens ex-
tended their winning streak by downing |
Charlotte High, 3 to 1, on Richardson Field, |
Thursday afternoon. Jenkins bested Josephs
and King in a slab duel which produced
some good baseball.

Burns led the work with the willow, get-
ting a double, single, and two walks from |
four trips to the plate, Charlotte’s lone run |
was scored on a home run by Black in the |
third.

In the first two innings, Jenkiys issued |
five passes, but after that he settled down, |
and, except for Black’s homer, he was com-
pletely in control of the situation. King, |
the Charlotte ace, was touched for two hits, |
a single and a triple, scoring one run, when
he entered the game in the sixth, but he
tightened up and allowed no more scoring.

BLOOD PRESSURE TEST

An ice-water test has been developed to
find in early life of an individual a tendency
toward high blood pressure. This allows
the prospective high blood pressure patient
to care for himself before the infirmity is
upon him, and possibly escape it.

STUDENTS NOT INDIFFERENT

College students of today no longer main-
tain the blase or indifferent attitude to life
that they had a few years ago, Dean Vir-
ginia C. Gildersleeve, of Barnard College,
said recently.
