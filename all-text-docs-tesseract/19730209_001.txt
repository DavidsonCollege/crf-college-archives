Faculty React To Compensation Report

By TOM BRUCE
Associate Editor
Members of the Davidson
chapter of the American
Association of University
Professors (AAUP) pointed
out in interviews this week the
danger of complacency and
false euphoria in the issue of
faculty compensation.

‘lam not trying to belittle the
national AAUP report which
shows that Davidson has
achieved a very good record of
faculty compensation relative
to its size,’ stated Brown Pat-
terson, professor of History and
president of AAUP.

‘However, I am concerned
that we understand that the
favorable report is based on
grouping Davidson with other
small schools that do not have
graduate programs.

Patterson referred to an in-
dependent study conducted by
the AAUP to measure the com-
parative salaries and benefits
offered by the colleges and
universities in the United
States. To insure parity, schools
are grouped in sections of
similar size and program.

Full professors at Davidson
received an average of $20,600,
according to the most recent
study, and associate professors
accrued $16,300 on the average.
Assistant professors were paid
an average $13,900, while in-
structors netted $11,800 on the
average.

“These different categories
are somewhat artificial. We will
not be able to compete in the
hiring of new faculty members
if they are attracted by the
larger schools which offer
more.

‘Davidson must realize that
in regard to faculty hiring it is
in competition with the small
universities and, to an extent,
the large ones, also,’ Patterson
said.

Plan For
Released

By BOB HOWELL
Managing Editor

A proposed system of faculty
and administration evaluation
was presented this week to the
faculty by the Committee on
Professional Affairs (CPA),
which has been working on the
plan since early last term.

Professor of Religion Max E.
Polley, chairman of the CPA,
stressed the tentative nature of
the proposal. “We wish the
faculty to discuss openly this
working document and to revise
and improve it,” he said.

“The basic issue.” he noted,
“is whether or not we want to
give faculty members ad-
ministrative responsibility in
this area.”’

The committee began work
on the plan in response to a
request from Vice President for
Academic Affairs John M.
Bevan concerning faculty
promotion, tenure and reap-
pointment.

Bevan, feeling present
evaluation procedures were

paper, please notify us and
we will rectify the situation,

The local AAUP released a
report within the last two weeks
to the entire faculty which
showed that Davidson may be
actually regressing in the area
of faculty compensation.

Based on comparisons of all
professors who taught at David-
son in the school year 1966-67
and all professors teaching at
Davidson in the school year
1971-72, there was a small net
cost in actual buying power.

Personnel records show that
in 1966 the average Davidson
faculty member received
$11,435 in salary. By 1972, the
mean salary was $14,580. To

counter the effects of inflation.
the Department of Labor Con-
sumer Price Index was utilized.

So in 1966 currency. the 1972
figure of $14,580 was only
$11.294. Consequently. David-
son faculty members are being
paid only 98.8 percent of what
they were paid in 1966 in actual
buying power.

Another study conducted at
the request of College President
Samual R. Spencer Jr. last year
shows that the professor who
stays at Davidson over a period
of years can expect his buying
power to keep pace with rising
costs.

This study set to examine
specifically the salaries of in-
dividual professors who taught
at Davidson in the 1966-67 <ci:dol
year and also in the 1970-71
school year.

This group, by no no means a
select one, enjoyed a 5.5 percent
increase in their actual buying
power. The Consumer Price In-
dex was also used to calculate
the influence of continuing in-
flation in those years.

“Our faculty enjoys a
relatively high salary scaie.
and our school is in rather
select company in this regard,"
explained Vice President for

Finance and Development C.
David Cornell.

“Only 40 colleges in our
category achieved the highest
possible rating for all faculty
posts relative to total com-
pensation," he said.

“The AAUP study reflected
not only the actual salaries of
faculty members but also the
fring benefits that are paid at
Davidson. For example, 15 per-
cent of a professor's salary is
paid into a retirement fund. The
college pays 50 percent of a
faculty member's Blue Cross
and Blue Shield.

Cornell Announces Federal Funds Loss
Due To Future Housing Committee Delay

By BRUCE MALOY
Managing Editor

Vice President for Finance
and Development C. David Cor-
nell announced in an interview
Monday that the college will not
be able to get federal aid to build
new student housing.

The college was planning to
apply for a Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) loan
which would have a three per-
cent. interest rate. This
program was discontinued in
President Richard Nixon's new
budget.

Cornell explained that
applications for Debt Service
Grants as the program is called

“had to be in the pipeline by
February 1."

“This means.’ said Cornell,
“that we will have to get a shor-
ter term commercial loan at an
eight or nine percent interest
rate.”

Business Manager Robert A.
Currie gave the details of the
program saying that the college
was actually planning to get a
commercial loan and that HUD
would pay the difference bet-
ween that interest rate and
their own three percent rate.

“There was a_— small
possibility that we could have
gotten a direct loan from HUD.
A HUD loan is for up to 40
years,”’ said Currie, ‘‘whereas a

inadequate, recommended a
more formalized method to in-
sure accurate appraisals of
faculty members and an ex
panded role for faculty and
students in evaluation.

He hoped such a plan would
also provide complete and per-
manent records of the
evaluations and appropriate
legal safeguards in- em-
ployment contracts.

The proposed document
suggests that “‘a committee
which includes faculty mem-
bers should have the -respon-
sibility for advising the
president concerning  ap-
pointments, reappointments.
terminations, tenure,
promotions, and salary in-
creases of the faculty."’

Consisting of five people--the
three divisional chairmen elec-
ted for staggered three-year
terms, one faculty member
elected at large to serve as
chairman for a four year term,
and the vice president for
academic affairs--this com-
mittee would be the central
point of evaluation.

“We felt anyone elected to
serve on the committee should
be in at least his fifth year of
teaching at Davidson so he'd
have an understanding of how
things work here,” Polley ex-
plained.

TheCPA proposal listed three
basic criteria on which a faculty
member would be evaluated.
One basis, teaching competence
and. skills. would entail such

factors as a professor's com-
petence in his discipline, ability
to communicate, availability to
students, and enthusiasm for
what he teaches.

Other criteria would include
professional competence and
skills (such as research projec-
ts in progress, publications)
and community service (par-
ticipation in on- and off-campus
activities.

A faculty member usually
would be evaluated once every
four years: each year any
faculty member eligible for
tenure and-or promotion would
be evaluated.

Nominations for faculty
members to be promoted would
be submitted to the committee
by departmental chairmen.

New and non-tenured
professors not on terminal ap-
pointments would be evaluated
annually in the case of one-year
appointments and at the begin-
ning of the second year in the
case of two-year appointments.

The committee would obtain
information on faculty mem-
bers from reports, recom-
mendations and interviews of
departmental chairmen and in-
terviews with faculty
colleagues.

A faculty member being.

terviewed by the committee
concerning how courses taught

commercial loan will be for 20
or 25 years.”

“Let's assume,” said Currie,
“a construction cost of $8000 a
bed for a 200 bed complex.
that’s $1.6 million.

“Just to show you the dif-
ference, interest on a three per-
cent loan over 30 years
would be $833,000, a six percent
loan would be $1,822,000, and the
interest on a nine percent loan
would be $3,041 ,000,"" he said.

“We can't know the exact
term or interest of the loan until
we get it,’ said Currie, ‘‘but
these figures give some in-
dication of the amount of money
we're talking about. I would
think that if our interest rate
were as high as nine percent
however, we'd try to get the
loan for the shortest possible
term.”

“I couldn't have guessed six
weeks ago that this was going to
happen,” said Cornell.

‘We have .discussed this
project with HUD,” said Currie,
‘In November they said they'd
be sending someone to work
with us.”

The information put out by
HUD says that’ working
drawings must be sent with
each application. At the time of
the cut-off, the college had not
chosen an architect.

“There were two closing
dates for applications for funds
from the 1973 budget,” said
Currie, “January 1 and May 1.
1973. We were geared toward
meeting that May deadline.”

“I'd like to point out,’’ said
Cornell, “that slowness of ac-
tion is one of the prices that you
pay for allowing so many people
to have a voice in what type of
housing we will have. I'm not
opposed to student input on
these matters nor am I blaming
anyone, but when you work
through a large committee as
was done in this case, you get
burned orice in a while.”

Asked what the effects of the
fund crisis would be, Cornell ex-
plained that, ‘‘It could force us
to cut costs on the housing, to
delay construction, or both.”’

Cornell added that student
room rents are expected to bear
the cost of housing. ‘I also
realize that there is a ceiling of
costs which students can af-
ford,’’ added Cornell.

“This problem will put a fur-
ther strain on the same funding
apparatus that has to finish
paying for the new E. H. Little
Library, a new Union and new
science facilities," added Cor-
nell.
