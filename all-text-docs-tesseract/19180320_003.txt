R. S. WITHERINGTON |
WINS COMMISSION

The following account from the
Charleston Evening Post gives some in
teresting news concerning R. S$, Wither
ington, an old Davidson man:

“Many of the. football fans who at
tended the games plaved by the naval
training cainp, as well as all Davidsor
College supporters, will be glad to learn
that R. S. Witherington, the fast half-
back who was sent io the camp at. the
Navy Yard here after the foothall season
started, and who played such a conspic-
uius part in the games participated in hy
Coach Johnnie Weeks’ eleven, has won a
commission as ensign in the Navy and i
still on duty in and about Charleston.
He expects to leave here shortly, how-
ever,

“It was almost in the middle of the
season when a young player with light
hair trotted out on Hampton Park with
the naval training camp team in one of
their games against the Navy Yard
eleven. All saw at once that the camp
had gotten hold of a new man, but this
was nothing startling, for new player
were being sent in every game, but this
boy had the build of a football plaver
and conducted himself ‘like a college
man who has played the game before.
It did not take long for the spectators
to be assured that Weeks had gotten
hold of a star.

He did all of the punting after that
first game he took part in. and sent the
hall in long, high, spirals consistently.
getting the oval away safely. When he
ran with the ball he was like a streak
of light and was hard to down. An-
other good part about his playing wa
the fact that he was never taken out of
a game on account of injuries or for anv
other reason and proved to be the team's

mainstay with Captain Mciinnon of
the backfield.

Witherington played with Davidson
College team in 1914-1915-1916. Dur-
ing the past vear this Presbyterian col-
lege team in the mountains of North
Carolina went down to Atlanta and
played the Georgia ‘ech Golden Tor-
nado to a standstill and proved to be the
only team in the country to be successful
in scoring on the mighty Heismann ma-
chine. Many who saw the game thought
that something awful would have hap-
pened to the Georgia team had the North
Carolinians been blessed with weight.
That was the kind of a team Withering-
ton played with before he left college to
join Uncle Sam's Navy and do his part
with the other young men of the country.
If he had not left his college studies.
Witherington would have played in the
backfield with the phenom, Flowers, and
his brilliant partner. Spann. He has
many friends at the Charleston Navy
Yard who have congratulated him upon
his success and wish him the best of
Juck.”
