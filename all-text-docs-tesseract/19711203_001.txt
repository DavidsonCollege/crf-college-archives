EPC Adopts Program

Of 3-Year Grad

By DOUG BROWN
Asst. Managing Editor

The Educational Policy Com-
mittee (EPC) has unanimously
adopted a proposal that would,
in effect, allow up to 5% of
each class to graduate from
Davidson in three years rather
than four. However, this report
has to be submitted to the fa-
culty for its approval.

The new accelerated program
will not apply to this year's
graduating class. Those who
will be eligible for accelerated
progress will be those upper-
class students with a_ grade
point average of 3.0 or better
for each of the two preceding
terms. Also, freshmen may ap-
ply for accelerated progress
with the recommendation of
their freshman adviser.

Those seeking to accelerate,
who must not be more than 5%
of any class, must receive the
approval of the Curriculum Re-
quirements Committee and the
department in which they plan
to major. Students pursuing ac-
celerated progress will take
four courses rather than three
courses each term.

In addition to those in the
accelerated program, students
desiring an enriched education-
al experience or those who are
deficient in courses, may take
four courses each term. Those
students who want an enriched
program or who are deficient
in a course must receive the
approval of the Curriculm Re-
quirements Committee, and they
are to be counted as part of
the 5% of each class allowed
to take four courses each term.

Students will be allowed to
take a maximum of four
courses per term under this
proposal, and they will not be
charged an additional tuition
fee. No additional tuition will
be charged under the assump-
tion that the Comprehensive
Fee will take effect next year
as scheduled.

All students will be required
to graduate in either June or
August, and if only one or two
terms are necessary for com-
pletion of graduation require-
ments in the last year, these
terms will be spring and win-
ter terms respectively.

In other words, a student can
not attend classes during the
fall term, and then not be at
Davidson for the winter and
spring terms. The reason for
this provision is to prevent an
accelerating student from dis-
placing a prospective student
from admission in the fall.

Accelerating students will be
able to register for their fourth
course only after all other stu-
dents have registered. The
fourth course cannot be an ex-
tended studies course.

The EPC feels that it is bet-
ter to spread students taking
a fourth course into’ those
courses where the ceilings have
not been reached. In this man-
ner, students pursuing regular
progress will be able to com-
plete the regular four year pro-
gram with their normal prior-
ity and progress.

The Accelerated Progress sub-
committee of the EPC was
chaired by Associate Professor
of Philosophy Earl R. MacCor-
mac, and other members were
Professor of Mathematics Rob-
ert B. Jackson and student rep-
resentative Doug Brown.

The EPC is using the 5‘< ceil-
ing on each class as a trial
figure, and it very well may
change when it is determined
what the student demand is for
accelerated progress.

The EPC believes that a com-
bination of advanced placement
credits and taking four courses
per term will enable some stu-
dents to graduate in three years
rather than four.

The present academic reg-
ulations do make some provi-
sion for accelerated progress,
but accelerated progress has

uation

not been a concept which has
been actively pushed by the
College. Most students seeking
accelerated progress have had
to rely almost entirely on at-
tending summer schol each sum-
mer.

The Accelerated Progress sub-
committee was formed at the
behest this fall of Vice-Presi-
dent for Academic Affairs John
M. Bevan who serves as chair-
man of the EPC. The new em-
phasis on accelerated progress
is another attempt on his part
to make Davidson’s curriculm
more flexible and compatible
with the needs of today’s stu-
dent.

Those students wno will be
able to pursue an accelerated
progress will be able to reap
a substantial financial saving,
especially if they are able to
complete their studies in three
years.

Asst. Managing Editor

Freshmen are now being as-
signed to eating clubs on a
weekly basis in order to revi-
talize lackedasical freshmen in-
terest in the new _ social pro-
gram.

Dean of Students Will H. Ter-
ry made the change after ex-
tensive conferences with hall
counselors, interested freshmen,
and fraternity presidents.

‘‘We have subdivided the halls
into four groups. The freshmen
in these groups eat every lunch
and dinner for a week at a spe-
cific house. They are assigned
to two different houses during
each ten-week period,” Terry
explained.

Trustees Make Final Decision On Facade

By RICH WILSON
Managing Editor

A final decision concerning
the facade of the new library
has been reached, according to
Warner L. Hall, chairman of
the board of trustees.

Hall said that the facade will
have a “‘more open and invit-
ing appearance” than the first
proposal, yet it will still har-
monize with thé’ other buildings
on campus. (

The arcade has been removed
in favor of a frontal facade with
a two story porch and columns.
The new library will also have
‘‘a good deal more glass in the

Library

front which will give it a more
open appearance,” Hall said.

An artist's conception of how
the library will look after com-
pletion is currently being pre-
pared and will be released as
soon as it is received from the
architects, according to College
President Samuel R. Spencer
Jr.

After tabling one proposed
sketch at the October meeting,
the board directed the Execu-
tive Committee to view revised
sketches and make the final
decision.

At a meeting Nov. 18, the Ex-
ecutive Committee jointly con-

vened with the trustee Building

and Grounds Committee and~™

the Library Planning Commit-
tee and viewed three new
sketches presented by the arch-
itects, and the final decision
was reached by a considerable
majority of those present.

Hall said that the _ inter-
ior of the library as well as the
East, North and South facade
will be the same as in the first
proposal.

Hall also said that demolition
of the Union and construction of
the library are still scheduled
to begin in the Spring soon aft-
er final examinations.

PATTERNS OF AUTUMN

Terry Assigns Freshmen
To Clubs On Weekly Basis

Freshmen and upperclassmen
alike had complained about the
difficulty in establishing any
kind of relationship with a per-
son when they only came in
contact at the houses twice a
week for a five-week period.

Terry said he hoped that ‘‘the
new program would promote
more interest among all involv-
ed, especially the freshmen.”

Tim Spencer, a freshman eat-
jing at the Delt house, stated
that he thought the change was
a definite improvement.

“Eating at the house every
day has given me a better
chance to really meet some of
the people down there. For their
part, they are making a genuine
effort to make me feel at
home,” Spencer said.

Initial freshmen response has
been mixed according to the
reception given at the various
eating clubs. Where the clubs
are making an effort to.include
freshman in their activities, the
freshman reaction is good.

However, where the houses
are doing little to promote the
new system, many freshmen re-
main discouraged about the
prospects for this most recent
change.

Terry noted that other changes
are in the offing to further en-
hance the program’s appeal for
freshmen.

‘“‘We hope to increase social
opportunities on the court for
freshmen. Improvements are
still needed to incorporate fresh-
men more in the social life of
the eating clubs,” Terry said.

As it now stands, all fresh-

men are being encouraged to
participate in the social life of
the house to which they were
most recently assigned.

Terry emphasized that the
majority of students who are
not presently assigned to any
house for the first week period
can go to any social events of
the house to which they were
last assigned in the fall term.

“One eating club has extend-
ed an open social invitation to
any of the students on a _ hall
in which only one quarter have
been officially assigned to par-
ticipate in the club’s_ social
life,” he said.
