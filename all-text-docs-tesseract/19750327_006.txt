. . Committee discusses needs

(Continued from page 1)

‘groups, including students
from farming and unskilled
family backgrounds.

The evening meeting of the
Goals Committee began with a
re-evaluation of its purposes.
According to Professor of
Religion David Kaylor, the
committee had spent a good
deal of the time during its
February 2ist meeting
discussing. plans for the Car-
negie Building, only to find out
later that the Trustees had
decided earlier in the day to
turn the building into a guest
house.

“I don’t have any desire
myself to be a part of a com-
mittee that is simply rubber
stamping decisions that have
already been made,’”’ Kaylor
said. “‘I feel that there’re some
hidden agendas here that we
don’t know about,’’ he con-
cluded.

President Samuel R. Spencer
Jr. assured Kaylor that no ef-
fort had been made to conceal
information from the com-
mittee, and that the Carnegie
Building had been the only sub-
ject that needed immediate at-
tention by the Board of
Trustees.

As the meeting continued,
Professor of Chemistry J.N.
Burnett said that he needed
more data from faculty,
students, and administrators
about goals before making
decisions about the areas Stair
had outlined at the opening of
the meeting.

“T have the feeling that we’re
kind of working in a vaccum,”
he said. ‘‘I:just can’t gaze into
a crystal ball and see what
things are going to be like in 12
years.”’

The economic instability also
was a concern of various comit-
tee members. Trustee Warner
Hall emphasized several times

that the college should consider
numerous ways of using its
available facilities before
building new facilities. Spencer
cited the increasing com-
petitiveness of state institutions
and said that Davidson should
strive for first quality
academic programs in all
areas.

SGA President John Munce
proposed that the committee

‘direct discussion to a recent

Senate resolution dealing with
student ideas about goals for
the college. He suggested that

‘this might be a jumping-off

point for the committee. The
group considered the Senate’s
resolution, and near the end of
the meeting concluded that a
similar report from faculty and
administration members on the
committee would be helpful.

The committee decided to
consider these perspectives on
goals at their April 23rd
meetings
