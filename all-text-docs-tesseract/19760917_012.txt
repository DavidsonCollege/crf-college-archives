“If You Didn’t Read It In
The Davidson Update,
It Didn't Happen.’”?!?

lf we students at The Davidsonian believed that, we wouldn't be publishing
weekly. But we are. These are a few of the things we do differently:

We follow the Wildcats. (The Update
only lets you know when they win.)
Unfortunately, you’re missing

a lot of news.

We print investigations,
analyses, and opinions of
program and policy.
(The Update assumes
that Davidson is
perfect.) We probe
mame On Geeper fff a eh CCR ee,
and point out the *% | i ahd R AN UANL NY xe NS
problems (soit = ||) hi RN fed he

will be perfect
by the time
we're alumni.)

Propaganda is not our
policy. We don’t try to
sell you Davidson ties,
blazers, or rocking chairs--
(Just subscriptions.) Which
is the point of all this.
We want you to keep
up with Davidson.
