Recruit Signed
As Strategy Redone

The 1975 Davidson College
football team was strengthened
by the signing of blue-chip
recruit Sid Osborne. Coach Ed
Farrell stated last week that
Osborne, a native of Atlanta,
had definitely decided to come
to Davidson.

Osborne is 6’2’’, weighs 190
pounds, and played quar-
terback for three years at
Atlanta Northside. During these
three years Northside was 28-1.
Osborne lettered every year,
and has been, named to the All
Metro-Team and the All-City
team. He is ranked among the
top 2% of high school athletes in
America and is a member of the
Prep All-American Squad.

Farrell explained that Osbor-
ne ‘‘appears to have all the
physical and mental qualities
we're looking for. He is a very
impressive passer and an ex-
cellent all-around athlete.
Osborne is a good leader, an at-
tribute that’s essential for a
quarterback.”’

During his senior year Us-
borne completed 54 of 101 at-
tempted passes for 1200 yards.
In addition he rushed for 250
yards. Farrell said, ‘‘He greatly
helps our quarterback
Situation. Sophomore Gary
Overstreet has a_ recurring
shoulder injury that makes him

questionable for next year. That |

leaves us with only two ex-

perienced quarterbacks, fresh- '

man Joel Golmont and junior
Mike Hall. So with Osborne we
now have more depth.”’

Next fall the Wildcats will be
operating from an entirely new
offense. Farrell said, ‘“We’ll be

the

March 20, 1975

playing from the Wing T of-
fense. Notre Dame and the
University of Delaware use it
and both teams - have con-
siderable success.

“‘We wanted to use it last fall
but were only able to implement
some of its aspects. For in-
stance, in the last two games we
passed for over 6 touchdowns
but only threw around 20 passes
in each game. It employs the
off-action pass and it is very ef-
ficient. There is room for decep-
tion if this formation is used
right,’’ Farrell explained.

He added, ‘‘This allows us to
balance our attack with running

as well as passing andOsborne
should fit in well, as he is more

than just a thrower.”

Osborne comes from an
athletieally inclined family. His
father, Larry Osborne Jr.,
played baseball for the Old
Detriot Tigers and Washington
Senators. His grandfather pit-
ched for the Brooklyn Dodgers
and the Cubs. The third-
generation star also excells at
baseball, and Farrell indicated
that Osborne will also play that
sport at Davidson.

Farrell concluded by an-
nouncing that the football staff
will conduct a free football
clinic the morning of Saturday,
March 29, to be followed by a
scrimmage that marks the end
of spring training.

“At this clinic we will show
some new thinking and strategy
in both our offense and defen-
se.’ Continued Farrell, ‘We
will use overhead projectors in
the morning, and the scrim-
mage will put our plans into ac-
tion. We hope students and
everyone else will feel welcome
to come and watch us.”’

Tew Leads Cats To First Win,
Diamonders Sport 1-4: Record

By Bill Lloyd
Staff Writer

The Davidson. Wildcats
defeated Appalachian Monday
in their first conference win of
the season by an impressive 5-1
margin. :

“It was an important win and
the team played a great game
both offensively and defen-
sively’’ commented Davidson
baseball coach Junior Wade.

The first two runs came in the

second inning as a result of -

smart base running by senior
catcher Mark Rodgeman.

The Cats played well in the
field having only 2 errors.

“Our pitching was excellent
for this game. Joel Tew pitched
well for us giving up only three
hits,” added Wade. Tew also
threw an impressive nine
strikeouts.

The Wildcats scored their last
3 runs. when senior first

baseman George Weiker slam- .

med a 365 foot homer to bring in
Dale Horner and Gary
Pomaroy.

It seems that the Cats are
finally starting to put things
together and if the same stan-
dard of play keeps up the Cats
will be tough as the season con-
tinues.

“T am real pleased with the
attitude and spirit shown by the
team especially after coming
back from four losses” said
Coach Wade.

The Cats are 1-4 at this point;
however they are 1-0 in the all-
important conference stan-

or:

The Wildcats were scheduled
to play Guilford Wednesday but
the game was postoponed until
next Monday. :

“Wade is optimistic for a win -

over Gruiford. Gruilford is a
tough team and the Cats will
have to play up‘to their poten-
tial.
