——_—
ORCHESTRA AND GLEE
CLUB CONCERT

The College Orchestra and Glee Club
gave an entertaining and humorous con-
cert in Shearer Hall last Saturday even-
ing at 8 o'clock. The Orchestra and
Glee Club this year is the largest and
one of the best ever put ont by David-
son. Its success lies both in each indi-
vidual member and in the excellent lead-
ers at the head of it. F. H. Baker ('17)
as director of the Orchestra, and J.-L.
Fowle (718) as leader of the Glee Club,
have been working faithfully all the year,
and much of the credit for the work
must go to them. -

tended by a large number of both stu-
