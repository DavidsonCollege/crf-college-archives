Tuesday during the winter term were usually
the days you would reach for the morning sports

VN

pages to see how far up the Wildcats had moved’ in the

national wire service Pane: .

This Tuesday 1 happened to notice below those
weekly ranking ‘a picture of Mel Davis. The face and
name seemed fairly familiar and I then remembered
a story several years ago in a national magazine on the
young New Yorker describing his as one of the best
schoolboy basketball players in the nation.

Davis, if you didn’t see Tuesday night’s game, is
one of the best players on a good St. John’s basket-
ball team. I decided I might as well make it to the
Coliseum to at least see him play. Also I recalled my
freshman year and one of the more exciting games
I had ever seen. It involved this same St. John’s team.
It was a game where St. John’s overweight forward,
Bill Paultz (now with the New York Nets), threw in
a desperation shot at the buzzer to shock the na-
tionally ranked ’Cats. ;

But | just didn’t expect this would happen again.
So I made it to Charlotte a few minutes past tip-off
to see what Mel Davis would do. After all, he was
fourth in the nation in rebounding, leading the-Red-
men in scoring, and could even an all-American
when he is a senior two per from now. |

However when | walked in I saw something I'd
never ‘expect. The’’Cats were ahead and Davis hadn’t
done much of anything. I don’t mean to degrade Da-
vidson or Mel Davis, but Davidson without Adrian
hasn’t been one of the years
periences, and I had a preconceived notion of Davis
as a Lew Alcindor or something.

Davidson was looking like the old Davidson at
times. They jumped off to a 12-4 lead before St.
John’s knew what was happening. But before I get
carried away, there were times when the ’Cats even
looked like those of the pre-Lefty, Terry Holland
days as they managed to let the Redmen back into
te eauce by turning the ball over 15 times in the first
half. ms

Eric Minkin even fancied himself at times as
another Doug Cook or Mike Maloy as he left Redmen
defenders bewildered with some beautiful moves
opening himself under the basket. It had to be the
best night the 6-7 Philadelphian had in his varsity
career. The injury ridden junior made eight of 15
shots from the field and eight of ten foul shots for
26 points.

The story around Mel Davis was simply the Da-
vidson defense and particularly Steve Kir . Al-
though Davis snatched 14 rebounds, he was ited
to 11 points. Kirley, whose offensive play last week
earned him the honor of the Southern Conference
Player of the Week, simply intimidated the Redmen
guards from getting the ball into the high scoring
orward. Once Davis did get the ball, Kirley fore
him to take many bad shots. :

And. of course there was the exciting finish. With
a little less than two minutes remaining and the score
knotted'54-54, Kirley batted away a St. John’s shot and
Holland wisely elected to let the clock run out. With
nine seconds remaining Duncan Postma drove the
baseline for the final shot but saw it blocked. .

Postma_retrieved the loose ball and’hit Kirley who
was open at the head of the key. Kirley (who claims

to be a better shooter at 30 feet) spotted Joe Sutter.

on the other corfter who banked the pinnig goal in
with the clock dying. I just wish Paultz and Lou Car-
neseca could have been there.

For the Davidson Wild-
cats, holding a slim lead
in the Southern Conference,
the schedule gets tougher
and tougher.

Tomorrow night at the
Coliseum the ‘Cats tangle
with the Wake Forest De-
mon Deacons, headed by
high scoring senior guard
Charlie Davis, in what pro-
mises to be one of the most
exiting games of the sea-
son.

Wake forest sports a 9-5
season record including a
conquest of Jacksonville.
They have also topped Duke
and North Carolina. They
feature an exciting offense
paced by Davis, possibly the
most exiting player in the
Atlantic Coast Conference.

Davis, averaging 27 points,,
per game, and senior Gil
McGregor, with 14, have
paced the Deacon attack
along with 69 sophomore
Pat Kefy and John Lewko-
witz. —

Coach Terry Holland com-
mented that ‘‘there will be
no. special defense against
Davis.”

“Duncan Postma will pro-
bably be guarding Davis. He
has had several good defen-
sive games. Of course we'll
help Duncan as much as pos-
sible without sacrificing any-
thing inside,” Holland added.

fHe pointed out that- Wake
has inside strength with Mc-
Gregor and Kelly as weil as
Davis’ great outside ability.
Holland agreed that the
Cat attack has been spotty
at times this year, and noted
that as long as Brian Adrian
remains out of the lineup.

defense against the ‘Cats is
a little easier.

Concerning Adrian, Hol-
land stated, ‘‘Brian is still
favoring his knee and I have
no idea when he will be. at
full strength.”’

The Wildcats return to

conference action next Tues-
day against winless VMI on
the road. *‘They are always

tough at VMI," “was Hol-
land’s immediate remark.

Holland. stressed the im-
portance of every conference
game from here on, since
the 'Cats could gain a bye
in the first round of the con-
ference tournament if they
win the title. ‘It is really
rough to play three games
in three days,’’ he said.

Spencer Will Ask Trustees
To Supplement Grid Grants

By JOE EARLE
Asst. Sports Editor a
College President Samuel
R. Spencer Jr: will take a

- proposal to the trustees this

spring that approximately

$70,000 be given to the Wild- ~

cat Club to pay for football
scholarships during 1971.

The Wildcat Club Athletic
Fund was set up to pay all
football scholarships through
alumni donations.

A goal of $150,000 was set
for the year 1970, and only
$80,650 was raised.

Spencer will recommend
that the college donate
money from the endowment
to supplement the deficit.

The Wildcat Club’s drive
was
from the cost of football
scholarships, a major part
of the overall! cost of the
football. program. Other
football expenses will be
paid by the college. :

Spencer said he felt this
would. give the Wildcat Club
a full trial year to raise the
necessary money. The. fund

. Grive has been in operation

five months.

Steve Heckard, director of
the fund drive said that he-
felt sure the money could be
raised during 1971.

“We raised the $80,000 in

to free the college ....

a short time,”’ he said, ‘‘and

‘once the operation °gets go-

ing, we should. have -little
trouble raising the full
amount.”

The budget for the fund
was set up in the trustee de-
cision last year. It is based
on a formula of. 52 scholar-
ships, the number used for
football, multiplied by $800,
the average amount of non-
athletic scholarships.

\As the cost of tuition rise,
the amount needed by the
fund will rise proportionally,
but Heckard foresees no pro-
blem in raising the necessary
money.

, The football scholarships
can be given out in any man-
ner the coaches determine,

with no __ prerequisites of
need.

Dave Fagg, head coach of
the Wildcats, was very crit-
ical of the program.

Fagg claimed that. the
manner in which the fund-
ing was set up put a burden
on the recruiters and on the
fund-raisers.

“But I feel sure that we
can continue to raise the
money,’’ he stated, ‘because
there are a lot of people that
want to see Davidson main-
tain a good football pro-
gram.”’

The money raised during
1970 will pay for scholar-
ships during 1971.

Fagg said that recruiting
would continue under the
premise that the money will
be paid by the college.

All basketball scholarships
are paid by the college.
