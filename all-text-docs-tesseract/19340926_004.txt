~—be-otherwise.”

by Me monT Brown

It’s this guy Mackorell again. Tle cer-
tainly has a very proper for the
way in which he performs on the grid-
and I believe if you would ask
Elon footballers about him they
would concede that this elusive Wildcat
leader is much harder to hold than any
fish they've ever pulled out of the bar-
rel. He was not only a menace when
he carried the ball, but his punting,
passing. and signal calling, proved too
much for the Christians. [| wonder what
North Carolina State will do in an ef-
fort to stop this man in
Saturday night.

Coach Heartly ‘‘Hunk’’ Ander-
son, gave his charges.a holiday
last Saturday, in order that he and
other members of the Wolfpack
tutelage crew might see the Wild-
cats in action before the highly
tooted State aggregation is pitted |
against them in the Gate City this
week-end. It will be an all im-
portant game for Mr. Anderson,
who formally makes his debut into
North Carolina football with this
contest. I hope that along with
an improved type of football, the
former Notre Dame mentor has
inaugurated a common language
at the technical institution, so the
men will all be able to understand
the signals without difficulty. It
has been rumored that this was a
big problem that the immediately
previous regime found trouble in
solving.

I am of the opinion that both Coach

“Doc” Newton and Sports Editor Jake
Wade of the Charlotte Observer are
slightly mistaken when they say the
Wildcats will finish the. season on the
bottom of the big five standing. In the
Sunday’s Observer Mr. Wade, in sum-

marizing his tour of the upper-quintet in
North Carolina college football circles
very firmly predicted that the Duke
University Blue Devils would carry off

first honors in the state this fall with
a clean slate, and that N. C. State, Wake
Forest, Carolina and Davidson would
follow in the order given. Coach New-
ton, when asked about this bold prog-
nostication, very pessimistically replied,
“That's correct—I don’t see how it can

Maybe so, but my Mis-
souri instinct makes me want to be
shown. I’ve seen many Davidson
teams stave off attacks that it seemed
almost impossible for a team their size
to stop.

Mr. Hugh Query, in a column
on the sport page of The Gastonia
Gazette last’ Friday afternoon,
showed a very noble spirit of
loyalty toward Davidson and its

_ athletic interests by an answer he
made to Mr. Dave Clark, big-shot
alumnus of North Carolina State.
Clark it seems made the predic-
tion that State’s football teams
would soon be to the place that
it could only be bothered to

Due to the fact that R. O. T. C. is no

exercise has been added to the program
of the college for these men who are
not enrolled in the military course.

The requirements for this course for
Freshmen are as follows:

1—Members of the freshman class not
taking military science will be required
to attend prescribed lectures on health

to supervised sections in gymnastic work
or to any freshman team engaging in
intercollegiate athletics, provided that
such members comply in full with regu-
lations required by coaches as regards
daily practice, training rules, ete. Such
students, therefore, must engage in pre-

Frosh Cross Country Candidates
Are Urged To Enter Cake-Race

Tomorrow a large number of first
year men are expected to take part in
the annual cake race, run at the begin-
ning of every school year.

This race is run every year for the
purpose of getting the freshmen inter-
ested in athletics, and also to see which
men are the best prospects for the cross
country races of the track outfit.

Numerous prizes are given every year
by business concerns and boarding houses
in Davidson which serves as an incefr-
tive to make men enter the contest and
try hard to win a place that carries a
prize.

Large Crowd Is i Is Expected To
Witness This Game

The Davidson College football team
will leave by bus Saturday afternoon 32
strong for Greensboto, making their first
Big Five invasion of the season at the
World War Memorial Stadium where
they meet the N. C. State College Wolf
Pack at 8:30 P. M., Saturday.

Headed by their “key” man and spark
plug of the team, Captain Johnny Mack-
orell, the Davidson outfit, fresh from
walking through the Elo Christians,
will meet their first opposition of note
for the season in the rejuvenated Wolf-
pack under Coach Heartley “Hunk” An-
derson.

The eyes of the football fans of the
state will center on this game as State
plays its first engagement under Ander-
son, against the strongest 'Cat team in
years. This will show whether Ander-
son has brought:a “New Deal” in foot-
ball for State or not, and whether the
hacks for Davidson or the bone
from State come out on top.
Undoubtedly the ‘Cat team will take the
air carly in an effort to get around the
State line which outweighs the Davidson
line about 20 pounds to the man,
