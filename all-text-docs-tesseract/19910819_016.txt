THE DAVIDSONIAN' CAMPUS LIVING monpay, AUGUST 19, 1991

By Jim Knowles

“Man, these streets are full of
rubble. Somebody oughta clean
that s--t up.” These were John
Hutton’s famous first words on
our initial diurnal expedition into
the streets and piazzas of the Impe-
rial City. His comments were
aimed at the numerous rows of
shattered columns and scatterings
of travertine debris that litter Old
Romeinthedaytime like gumwrap-
person God’s own playground, re-
minding passersby of every creed
and nation that there is no escape
from the long, slow sweep of Time.

Fifteen Davidson College stu-
dents and D.C. professor Nina
Serebrennikov set up temporary
headquarters amidst the cob-
blestoned chaos of downtown
Rome for four months last spring,
and we learned to love that rubble,

The Davidson in Cambridge

program was enhanced with all
kinds of harmony this summer. At
first we clung to our walkmansand
tapes from home, depending on
them to help us sur-
vive the eight hour
plane ride overseas.
Little did we realize
the melodies that
awaited us in Eng-
land: the echoing
sounds of London
Underground per-
formers with saxo-
phones or tambou-
rine style coin bags;
the Phantom of the
Opera’s sweet and
desperate “music of
the night”; concert-
lectures on 18th
century — harpsi-
chords; ourown mix
tapes as background
music for countless
spades games in the Wolfson Col-
lege club room; and those inspir-
ing American songs blaring at our
favorite pub on the fourth of July.
But the finest harmony we found
was that of the 28 individuals in
our group.

Upon arrival we seemed to be
an odd mix. There were 17 girls
and 11 guys. Aside from the few
small groups of good friends and
one firmly attached couple, many
of us didn’t know each other at all.
But we had similar expectations:
torelax, to visit the best parts of the
country (and find the best pubs), to
be enlightened by Cambridge lec-
turers and a light workload, and to
mix with people from Davidson
and from all over the world.

«Our wishes: were easily ful-
filled, and we finished the six weeks
with new friends who would stand
by us despite the fact that we left

along with whatever each one of us
chose to make it represent. Re-
gardless of our sighs and those of a
thousand others, the rubble re-
mains.

Tonight I sit in front of
the computer at my home in the
New World, trying to condense
into a few short paragraphs the
essence of my past eight months’
experience so that the first issue of
this year’s Davidsonian won’t be
lacking in juicy stories of Study-
Abroad smutandsmeg. Alas, I try
in vain. We’ve all been through
this before. I suppose I could fall
back on humorous anecdotes to
help me fill these pages--and there
are some hum-dingers that I could
tell--but I don’t trust my own sense
of humor in these matters, much
less yours.

Nevertheless, the people who

How about a rundown of the trip?
Now if it’s juicy details you’re
after, you’ll have to consult indi-
viduals. Be sure to ask Mary Russ
and Meg Davis about their Italian
friend Franco and his leather fac-
tory. Stephanie Glaser, Andy

Schraeder, and ‘Liz Clarke have

There are plenty of great sto-
ries to spice up a response to that
generic question “how was your
summer?” But, as far as general
highlights go, here’s what we re-
ally enjoyed: —~

stumble upon a bit of broken trav-

Rome for a moment or two, no
doubt smiling while the memory
lasts. Some of us might cry, some

try to attach some hefty signifi-
cance to this piece of rubble; none
of us however, not even John
Hutton, will attempt to clean it up.
Of this I am sure.

to Washington.

On July 4, the group flew to
Springfield, Missouri, where the
president walked in a small town
parade and gave a speech. ‘Later
that day, they travelled to Michi-
gan, where Tisinger was part of a
“travel pool” of about ten reporters
who rode in a flatbed truck in front
of the president as he participated
in another parade, and then gave
another speech. This pool serves
to report on any major unexpected
event,

To top off this Fourth of July
trip, Tisinger rode to the airport in
a motorcade of about 20 cars, and
then flew on the president’s plane
back to Washington.

Not only did Tisinger have the
exciting experience of covering this
event, but he also worked on other
interesting projects at the Journal.
From day to day, he researched
differenttopics for reporters, which
included attending press confer-
ence, and gathering information.
He attended the press conference
of the National Abortion Rights
Activists’ League (NARAL) where
they announced their opposition to
Bush’s nomination of Clarence
Thomas to the Supreme Court.
Tisinger also worked on the BCCI

investigation with the Journal
reporter who covered the scandal.

Second, Tisinger worked on
an ongoing project of writing a
feature article for the Journal. The
article, which appeared in the July
22 Wall Street Journal, focusedon
the conflict between the Bureau of
Engraving and Printing (BEP) and
the U.S. Postal Service about who
has the authority to print stamps.

Since 1894, the BEP has
printed stamps, but under Reagan,
the Postal Service began to privat-
ize the printing. Many of the bright,
colorful stamps we often use today
are printed by private businesses,
while more traditional stamps are
done by the BEP.

Before this summer, Tisinger,
who is also a reporter for the
Davidsonian, says he was consid-
ering a journalism career, but had
not decided. Now, however, after
weeks of first hand experience, he
Says that he is leaning more to-
wards moving into the newspaper
business.

know more about what is going on

in Washington thananybody--even

more than the Congressmen, “
Tisinger said. “I learned an incred-
ible amount from listening to the
reporters giving their opinions on
all different issues.”
