"THE COPPE

J. M. Dunlap, Editor.

Fresh Sydenstricker solves the
“high cost uf flowers” problem by
sending his girl some forget-me-not
seeds.

On Sprunt field last Thursday
there was given a comical perform-

ance modeled after the famous play.)
The title of this) crahs—a huge production.

“Mary’s Ankle.” :
play was “Ump’s Ankle,” and while

Umps did the leading roll.

Eris C—"I’m sorry but I can’t eat
sweets between meals.”

Fair One—“Then eat enough to
make it a meal.”

“Shep” (to girl on train)—“Do
you believe in Darwin’s Theory ?”
Girl—“Yes, at times.”

Did you notice who occupied the
“bald head row” at the concert at
Queens last Saturday?

Give us a rest from the verses
That we hear from day to day.

Sing us a brand new song again
And sing it without delay.

Cut out the calsomined faces,

Outblazing the sunsets red.
Away with the hair which once
Grew out on another’s head.

Sing on a pleasant subject,

just so it is something new,
‘Li

e the joys of going to chapel
Or the pleasures of a review.

Boost up the board you're getting,
Tell the joys of being sick—

But when you start to do it, lad,
Be ready to dodge a brick.

or. Under court-martial Milt and
