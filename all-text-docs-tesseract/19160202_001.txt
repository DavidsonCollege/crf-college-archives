While basket ball is at present fore-
most in the athletic world at‘ Davidson
not a few students are already anticipat-
ing the coming base ball season. Even
now on the warmer affernoons students
may be seen on the campus tossing the
horse-hide.

When practice is called. which will
probably be towards the last of -Feb-
tuary, there will be a large number to
report, and there should be some keen
rivalry for. the different positions. Be-
sides Alford, Saunders, Lawson, Wood,
Black, Hengeveld, Brown, Keesler and
Walker, of last year’s squad, there are
several new men who are expected to
show up well.

The manager has arranged an excel-
lent schedule, having games with the
leading colleges of the South. Eleven
games are to be plaved on the “Hill.”
Among the teams that will appear here
are Washington and Lee, Guilford and
Trinity.

Defeated by Winston Y. M.C.A.

In the first game of a three-day road

trip, Davidson swamped Guilford Col-

lege, playing at Guilford, by the score of
49 to 26. The game was replete with
fouls, Davidson gleaning 9 points by
this route, while Guilford totalled 12.
For Davidson, the whole team, as
usual, played such consistent ball that it
would be hard to single out any one
“star.” King and Hengerveld, how-
ever, put up a brand of ball that deserves
special mention, with Eddie Childs cash-
ing in his usual quota ot points. For
Guilford, T. Seamans played the best

mine. “Phe line-up: .

ELON GAME.

With both teams playing whirlwind
ball, and every man putting everything
he had into the game, Davidson evened
up the score with Elon by taking the sec-
ond game of the trip from Flon College.
23-to 18. Davidson had all the pep and
steam which was lacking in their first
encounter with Elon here, and in conse- .
quence casily defeated the down-staters.
Childs plaved an especially fast) game,
garnering nearly half’ of Dasidson’s
points. For Elon, R. VT. Bradford play-
ed excellent ball. Line-up:

WINSTON Y. M. C. A.

In a nip-and-tuck game that was not
decided until] last whistle echoed, David-
son lost the third game of her three-day
jaunt to the Winston-Salem Y. M. C.
A. to the tune of 34-33. When the
timekeeper’s whistle blew for the end of
the final period, Hengeveld had just
tossed the ball from the centre of the
court, and it had not yet reached the
goal. When it did Vit went through, but
the referee ruled that it did not count.
Had it been allowed to count, the Red
and Black would have registered a third
victory, 35-34.

The outstanding feature of the game
was the sensational playing of “Monk”
Younger, who, guarding one of the best
forwards in the state, held: him to two
