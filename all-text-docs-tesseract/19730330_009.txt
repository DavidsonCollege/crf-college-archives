Davidson Prognosticator Predicts

Wildcat Basketball Season Record

By BOB WETZEL
Asst. Sports Editor

In the wake of the now-
concluded Davidson basketball
season, a number of facts are
clear:

1. Davidson's varsity finished
with an 18-9 record.

2. The Cats won their ninth
Southern Conference regular
season title in the past 10 years.

3 Miteneli Jonson. a David-
son senior from Charleston,
South Carolina, correctly
predicted the Cats’ regular
season won-lost record (16-8) at
the begining of the season.

The first three of the above
observations are pretty much
common knowledge, but the
last one probably isn't. But it is
just as true as the others.

Johnson's amazing
prognostication was the result
of a project in Randall Kineaid’s

Economies 113° class of the
fall term.
The class, which is_ titled

**Managerial Economics,’ em-
phasizes a number of decision
models for use by businesses,
other institutions, and_in-
dividuals.

An _ individual project em-
phasizing at least one of the
‘models studied was a_ sub-
stantial part of the course.

Mitchell used the time series
regression model and Jerry
Roberts’ computer program for
statistical systems in con-
junction with data gathered for
a number of variables related to
Davidson basketball over the
last 10 years in formulating his
prediction.

“The topic was a natural one
for me," he commented.

“I've always been interested
in basketball. Like almost
everyone else here at Davidson,
I played in high school," John-
son added.

He obtained the necessary in-
formation for his project from
the registrar's office, the
basketball office, and the office
of sports information.
‘*Everyone was most
cooperative," he noted.

“The only problem I had was
with the coaches. Coach (Bo)
Brickels thought I was spying
for the budget committee."

The factors considered in the
regression ranged from com-
mon physical attributes
(height, weight, age) to less
relevant variables such as birth
order rank and College Board
scores.

The variables selected by the
computer for the final
regression formula were:

1. average team class.

2. number of returning op-
position lettermen.

3. whether or not the head
coach was Coach of the Year in
the preceding season (negative
factor! )

4. nomber of All-Americans
on the squad.

The resulting coefficient of
determination (for those in-
terested) was 0.90 with a
corrected standard error of
17.84 percentage points.

Though the prediction was for
16 victories, the range of 96 per-
cent confidence (two standard
deviation) was from 14 to 18
wins.

“The project was_in-
teresting,’’ Johnson added. ‘I'd
never had any experience with
the computer before."

He also said that it was in-
teresting trying to figure out if
the prediction would come true
during the season.

‘IT thought the loss to West
Virginia had blown it,” he said.
“But the victory over Furman
made the prediction look good.”

Mitchell commented that he
had informed Head Coach
Terry Holland of his findings
just before the Wofford game
(the first of the season). ‘‘He
just smiled. I don't know if he
even remembers it now.”

Emil Parker, Davidson's
sports information director,
was another case.

Johnson said that ‘he sort of
frowned and referred me to
some nationally syndicated
power ratings which predicted
an 18-6 regular season for
Davidson.”

Mitchell noted that he still has
the formula from his
regression.

“If someone would be willing
to collect the necessary data
next fall, it would be interesting
to see if the regression was
correct two years in a row,” he

added.

Wade continued

Wade ts enthusiastic about his
new position and expressed op-
timism concerning the tuture of
Davidson football

“After meeting Coach Fagg
and the rest of the statt TP was
really impressed. The Southern
Conference ts a fantastic place
to begin coaching and [feel that
the potential of the school toot-
ball wise ts really good.” Wade
said. “It’s only a matter of time
before the program starts to
pay off here.”

Wade qualitied ius optinism
by pointing out that a lot. ot
Davidson losses last season oc-
curred an the last) several
minutes of plir

Wade felt that athe biggest
problem for the football team at
present is recruiting

“Its hard tor a school like
Davidson to attract top
atheletes who are also good
students.” Wade said.

One of the tactors wimeh at-
tracted Wade to Davidson is tie

stress placed on the passing
game here

“TL hike the passing game. |
makes for more exciting foot-
ball and its a lot) more en-
jovable to watch too” Wade
said

In connection with fis
preference for the passing
game. Wade felt (nat bis biggest
contribution to the team as an
olfensive line coach would be to.
“enable the line to hold their,
blocks a little longer so. the
receivers could: execute their
patterns and the quarterback

can throw without much
pressure
Head Coach Dave Fagg

welcomed the addition of Wade
to tis stall saving. “John is a
Breat coach and we were lucky
to get him to come to Davidson
I think that: he can make a
tremendous contribution to the
program here”
