IFC Resolution

The IFC urgently recommends to all frater-
nities and their members: that they continue to
approach all members, whether brothers or pled-
ges, with the assumption that they are mature,
responsible and self-governing individuals and
that they alone can take the steps necessary to
eradicate hazing in all its varied forms; that

Davidson chapter of Kappa
Sigma and ?. Kappa Alpha
voted to retain their nation-
al affiliation.

According to Kappa Sig
social chairman Gary Hem-
ric, finances and rush pow
er were the issues involved
in their 22.5 vote.

Stagg Newman. who head-
ed the Pika committee study-
ing national affiliation. said
that the report of his cortn-
mittee was passed by the
fraternity with only one dis-
senting vote. The committee
was in favor of going local
until the study was made.
Newman said.

"We felt that it was finan.

Details
Stalled

According to Dean. of the
Faculty W. Frontis Johnston.
the nature of the ROTC pro
‘gram for next year cannot
be outlined with any degree

_ of certainty at present, but
‘ will be decided upon in the
near future.

_ The reason for the uncer
tainty about the program
stems from the nature of
the college’s contract with
the Army. The contract stip
ulates that a year's notice
be given before any change
in the pregram can be insti-
tuted,

Johnston pointed out that
the extent of change in the
program for next year would
be determined by negotia
tions which will take place
with the Army in the near
future.

The Dean noted that a
more definite picture of the
Davidson program would be
available after he had con-
sulted with the head of the:
ROTC Department, Col. Fred.
erick Outlaw. He said that
this consultation would take
place in the next two weeks.

Newman said that the na-
tional charter provided ail
the autonomy desired by the
chapter. The chapter has con.
trol over selection proce-
dures.

“Many of us felt that tne
national fraternity was play
ing a smaller role here as
time goes on and that the
money could be better spent
here.” Hemric said.

‘It seem to us that the
guys here. at Davidson dre
beginning to see that they
have freindships and associ-
ations which are outside the
fraternity and which are
equally important,”” Hemric
said.

“Because of our bylaws.
our pledges were not allowed
to vote." Hemric said, ‘‘But
a straw vote was taken in
the pledge class before the
issue was brought to the
brotherhood. The result of
the straw vote was over-
whelmingly in favor of ‘re-
maining part of. the natian-
al,"

According to Hemric, che
principal reason for the de-
feat of the proposed localiza
tion was that it was feared
that such a move would da
mage the fraternity’s rush
program.

“We also thought however.
that to go into rush as the
only local fraternity on cam-
pus would put us at a de
finite disadvantage. Hemric
said. This is especially true
with regard to the. develop
ment of the fraternity over
the next two or three years
and carried more weight
than the financial issue. he
said.

‘Now that the vote has
been taken, the local auto-
nomy issue is. dead for the
time being, at our house,”
Hemric said. “We are car
tainly not poised, waiting for
someone else fo make the
first move.”

“Our national organization
gives us a great deal of
freedom in running our own
affairs, so we are content
with the present situation.”

they appeal individually and collectively to each
other to bury and forget injurious hazing tradi-
tions; that they coordinate with campus adminis-
trators to rid Davidson College of any lingering
evidences of hazing: and above all that they en-
deavor to broaden and strengthen pre-initation
activities in order to make them constructive,
useful programs consistent with their own ideals

and teachings.

: POLICY STATEMENT
Hazing shall be defined as any action
taken or situation intentionally created
which might be physically or mentally
harmful and/or involving an outside indi-
vidual or group of individuals which re-
flects poorly on the fraternity system and

Davidson College.

In the area of physical hazing, no pad-
dling in any form will be tolerated. Road
trips and forced consumption of food will
also be considered hazing.

Mutual consent does not determine the
validity of a preinitation activity. Where
unequals (pledge-brother) are involved,
mutual consent is felt to be a contradiction

in terms.

Although the concept of scavenger hunts
is not inherently wrong, often outside in-
dividuals are involved in a degrading man-
ner in this activity. Any fraternity plan-
ning to use this activity in their pledge
program must submit a list of items for
inspection prior to the activity.

The IFC also would like to take this oppor-
tunity to notify the College of a policy change
concerning the release of information concerning
trial convictions. In the future, the nanie of the
fraternity’ involved (no individual's name will
be used), the general reason for the penalty and
the nature of the penalty will be publicized.
This policy is not retroactive to any previous

convictions.

Each individual fraternity must accept the
responsibility to adhere to our own set of regu-
lations which are written in light of the Code of
Responsibility. The IFC Judicial Board must find
‘its proper perspective in relation to other judicial
bodies and will continue its attempt to coordi-

~ nate with these bodies and to formalize relation-

ships.

Alters Car Policy

A new resolution that stu
dents receiving financial aid
may have cars has been
recommended to President
Samuel R. Spencer by a
faculty commitiee.

“This recommendation was.
accepted unanimously by the
Committee on Admissions
and Financial Aid.”’ said Dr.
William B. Hight Jr. Hight is
chairman of the committee.
Professor of Education. and
Director of Student Counsel
ing at Davidson.

The Committee on Cars

and. Scholarships represent-
ing the Student Senate also
approved the recommenda
tion unanimously. This com
mittee was composed of Ro
bert Ambrose. Somers Price,
and Chairman David Sweatt.

The . recommendation will
allow scholarship students to
have cars on campus for the
remainder of this year and
for 1969-70. The policy will
be re evaluated in the sprig
of 1970.

The plan specifics certain
conditions fo protect the col-

lege from financing cars. The
car should be purchased only
with excess earnings. It's
expenses will be added to the
scholarship student's report
of personal expenditures. The
value of the car will be add
ed to the student's assets
as figured by the College
Scholarship Service.

@ars for financial aid stu-
dents are to be registered in
the Financial Aid Office when
they are brought on campus.

LAMMERS SPEAKS TO SYMPOSIUM
Biology professor joins others in describing man’s devastation of nature.

Symposium Seeks Cure

Of Civilized Suffocation

Cocurricular education at
Davidson assumed a new
form in the Symposium, on
Environmental Problems this
week when professors. not
outsiders, took the podium for
the whole course of the pro-
gram.

Taking advantage of the
interest and study of David-
son professors, the three-
night symposium included
presentations by members of
six different departments.

Sponsored by the Philan-
thropic Literary Society, ex-
penses for the program were
borne by a twenty dollar
geant from the Activities
Grant Foundation.

“The earth did without man
for millions of years.”’ con-
cluded Dr. Hallam Walker.
associate professor of French.

in the final presentation of
the symposium. ‘“‘and it can
do without man again.’

Walker's concluding _re-
marks mirrored the concern
of all the speakers that the
problems of the environment
have assumed crisis propor-
tions at a time when the bios-
phere is already threatened
by a human population ex-
plosion.

Only when decision-makers
in all areas become aware
of the seriousness of the
problems will we begin to
protect ourselves from our
own shortsightedness,”’ said
junior David Sweatt, moder-
ator of the program.

The Monday night program
was entitled “Man in the
Biosphere’’ and included pre-
sentations by Dr. W. T.

Lammers, associate profes
sor of biology, and Dr. David
G. Grant, assistant professor
of biology.

‘*Economics and Politics of
Environmental Change’’ was
the topic Tuesday night.
That program included pre-
sentations by Dr. Louise Nel
son, associate professor of
economics; Dr. James G.
Martin, aSsociate professor
of chemistry; and Professor

William E. Jackson, assis-
tant professor of political
science.

Wednesday night's conclu-
sion to the symposium was
entitled “Human Culture,
Ethics and the Environment”
and featured presentations
by Dr. Samuel D. Maloney.
professor of religion, and by

Leaders
Campus

Student unrest on campus
and national response to it
were the topics for a con
ference of student govern
ment presidents and campus
editors which DAVIDSONIAN
co-editor Franklin Anderson
attended in Washington last
weekend.

The group of about 20 was
drawn at random from among
those who signed a statement
announcing their refusal to
accept induction for the du
ration of the Vietnam War.

According to Anderson. the
basic topic of discussion cen-

tered around recent student .

disorders. ‘‘The consensus
seemed to be that we could
neither condemn nor con.
done disorders,’’ Anderson
said. ‘“‘Most of us felt that
reforms are needed. Yet. we
can't really agree with the
means they’re using.”

Anderson noted that the
conference decided not to
discuss particular situations
such as those at San Fran-
cisco State or Cornell.

“We did not agree on this

tion.

The policy statement added
that mutual consent between
pledges and fraternity broth
ers docs not make an ac-
tivity defined as hazing legal
because ‘’where unequals are
invalved, mutual consent ‘1s
‘felt to be a contradiction in
terms. ° :

point. however. that the stu-
dent movement isn’t totally
caused by small groups.”
Anderson said. ‘Violence is
the result of a minority, but
dissatisfaction with the rigid
ity of many American uni
versities is widespread.”

Anderson noted that many
felt the colleges and univer-
sities are being used by the
establishment.

‘In a number of cases, the
independence of the univer
sity has been violated by the
encrochment of the Pentagon.
On many campuses today.
there are substantial amounts
of military research being
done,” he said...

Anderson disagreed with
those who saw _ voluntary
ROTC as an encroachment
by the. military. serious
enough to warrent protest.
“But what we're saying is
that the university can't
speak out as a whole against
the war, nor can it be hon-
est and fair, if it allows the
military to use its professors
and its facilities," he said.

"We were very happy that
we were able to work out a
policy that was satisfactory
both to the college and stu-
dents."" commented Hight.

“The faculty's committee
worked very hard and so did
the students." continued
Hight. ‘7. thought those three
boys did a masterful job of
presenting the student
ideas."

Sweatt appeared before the
SGA Senate Wednesday, to re.
port the final result of his
cominittee’s efforts.

We're pleased with this
recommendation, said
Sweatt “It reflects a_ real
change in philosophy. The
first recommendation by the
committee several weeks ago
was a strict reaffirmation of
the old policy. .

" “With extensive research
and, we think, the weight of
logical argument, it was pos-
sible to convince the, mem-
bers of the committee that
this step was not only in
the best interests of many
students. but in the best in-
terest of the college itself.
Sweatt said. It seems to us
that this is particularly true
with regard to the recruit
ment and happiness of Black
students,’ he said.

Price commented that the
change would “do a great
deal to alleviate the -social.
problems of out of stale stu-
dents.”

He added \that the policy
Change “also shows how
foint. student faculty discus
sions can work out reason
able policies favorable to
both sides."

cast in the election.

As first chair barber ina
Johnson's Barber Shop on
Main Street. McClain deals
with people from all over
town, and should therefore
be able to improve communi-
cations between the Town
Council and the townpeople.

Since this is his first pub-
lic office, however, he wants
to get to know his job well

before committing himself to
any specific programs, he
said,

McClain is particularly in-
terested in working with the
Mayor's Community Rela-
tions Committee to help build
a more closely integrated
town.

“I'm willing to work with
the Mayor's) Committee in
any way they want me to.
I intend to work for the bene,
fit of the whole town, though,
and not for any special pri-
vate interests on either side
of the tracks.”’ McClain said
firmly.

The 426-vote turnout rep-
resents about 69 percent of
the 625 registered votes in
the Town of Davidson.
