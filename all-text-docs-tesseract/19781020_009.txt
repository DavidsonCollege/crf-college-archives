Foes fall Pi 3. 1 score

Cattes triumph over Duke and ECU

By BELLE ERDMAN
Staff Writer

The women’s field hockey
team had been looking forward
to this past weekend’s confron-
tation with Duke and East
Carolina University for quite a
long time.

All the practice and anticipa-
tion paid off as they came home
with two decisive victories.

Coach Susie Roberts was
ecstatic and kept repeating,
“They were great, just great!”
Her comment referred to the
overall improvement of indivi-
duals and also the cohesiveness
as a team, which grows stronger
with each game the team plays.

"Both the Duke and E.C.U.
games ended with 3-1 scores. In
each game, Ann Clark, Cathy
Inabnet, and Lisa Ballantyne
each came through with one
goal apiece.

Davidson was first to put a
goal on the record in each case,
which definitely helped spark
enthusiasm and morale at an
early point in the game.

Coach Roberts felt it was the
first game where the girls really
played together as a team.

JUNIOR GEORGE Strobel begins to ease up after running a
fine crosscountry race to finish high for the team.

Ballantyne and Inabnet were
invaluable assets to the forward
line as they kept the field wide
open with their passing and
hustling.

In both of the squad’s pre-
vious seasons, the Cattes had
Icst to Kast Carolina. Aware of
their own vast improvement,
they wanted to prove it to these
challenges.

Yet E.C.U. was a big rival for
a more personal reason as well.
One player put it this way as
she referred to Dee-Dee Mayes,
this year’s assistant hockey
coach, ‘‘Dee-Dee had an offer
from E.C.U. to be the assistant
coach there. We wanted her to
know she made the right deci-
sion.”

The Cattes were not permit-
ted more than one day of rest
before travelling to. Winthrop
on Monday. The game ended at
1-1; Kirk Cameron scored the

game’s only goal on a pass from
Inabnet. Though the score was
tied, Coach Roberts felt it to be
one of the team’s most aggres-
sive games.

season. From this weekend,
however, co-captain Ann Clark,
has proven herself to be valu-
able in the circle also. She has
been moved to a new middle
position and contributed two
goals as a result.

extensively consistent ability:
Barbie Ashley, Kirk Cameron,
and Leea Pittenger. Ashley and
co-captain Cameron are veter-
ans to the team. Pittenger,
however, was manager and
trainer for the hockey squad for
its first two years.’ Now on the
field she has proved to be a

defender in Davidson’s offense zone.

Lacking a coach due to ill-
ness, the-eross-country team
traveled to Wake Forest to-be
greeted by a confused, tangled
mess of a meet. Still, despite a
course with the appearance of
spaghetti, Davidson runners
made a solid showing, edging
out an improved Georgia State
team, 26-28.

They were beaten as expected
by Wake Forest and. in turn
beat UNCC. The team’s record
at the close of dual meet
competition is a rather disap-
pointing 4-8.

Results of the meet were not
available, so specific placings
by team members can not be
given. Davidson was led by
captain Doug Horn, followed by

Bart Landess and John Davis --
all three under 33:00 on what
proved to be a short 10,000 m.
course. Greg Burnard pulled in
next, closely. marked by Terry
Morrow.

John Hoots finished 6th for
the Cats, ahead of George
Strobel who showed the strains
of a week of little training and

valuable player.

The hockey team now stands
with a record of 5-1-2: Looking
ahead to the Deep South Tour-
nament on November 3-4, Dav-
idson looks to be good prospect

for the championship as a‘team
and also in the individual

all-star selections.

Harriers nudge Georgia State

Many members of the team
look forward to setting personal
records in this traditiofally fast
race and hope to extend this
expected improvement to the
Southern Conference Cham-
poinship three weeks hence as
they enter the hardest part both
of their schedule and their
training.

less sleep. John Rees was next
and rounding out the scoring for
Davidson was Andy Umhau,
coming in 9th for the team.

The team would like to. wel-
come back Coach Norman Kol-
ler, now on the road to recovery
from a serious case of influenza,
and look forward to his leader-
ship as they travel to Raleigh
for the North Carolina State
Cross-Country Meet.
