Consecutive Contest

Davidson’s Catfish broke two school records here
Thursday night as they stopped a stubborn Georgia

squad 60 to 35.

The victory was their sixth of
the season, and fourth in a row.
The Catfish have been beaten
only once—by VMI.

Coach Dwight Shoe was
“thrilled to death” with per-
formances of John Scott and
“Smitty” Smith, who bested
their own records from last
year.

Scott overtook his Georgia
opponent on the third lap of the
200-yd. . butterfly event and

Inactives Voted

Ineligible By IMAC

The Intramural Athletic
Council ruled last Monday
that inactive fraternity
members would not be eli-
gible to play on the Inde-
pendent athletic teams.

The ruling specified that
since basketball and handball
seasons had started, the inac-
tives would be eligible to finish
out the seasons in these sports
with the Independent teams,
They will not be eligible to
compete in the track meet and
other spring sports, however.

The IMAC. passed a second
ruling which allows inactives to
play for their respective fra-
ternities if the fraternities are
willing for them to do so. IMAC
president Tyree Finch said that
the second legislation is design-
ed to afford inactives some
chance to participate in intra-
mural athletics.

went on to replace ‘his 2:34.7
record from 1959 with a time
of 2:33.

Two bouts later
swept through the 200-yd. back-
stroke to shave his 1959 record
of 2:23.3 by one-tenth of a sec-
ond.

this afternoon for Davidson
fans to see even more records

| Tech,

Sull another Georgia team is
on tap for next Friday. Emory
will bring to Davidson a squad
which shouldn't be too much of
a problem, according to Coach
Shoe.

As he remarked enthusiastic-
ally following the Georgia meet,
“We're on our way now.”

Coach Shoe, in his first
year at Davidson, felt that his
team — “the best bunch of
boys I’ve ever coached” —
had beaten the best when
they subdued the Bulldogs.

And the Catfish were not at
top strength. Distance men Bill
Hellier and Tom _ Hudgins,
though they swam, were still
weak from the flu.

Every man on the Davidson
squad saw acuon: Scott, Smith,
Hudgins, Hellier, Gabel, Branch,
Hunter, French, Ambrose,
Young, Collins, Rose, Whitting-

ton, Snider and McDonald.

Editor’s Note: For the Independent viewpoint of

see Letters to the Editor,

LAST MONDAY nine members of the Intramural

| Athletic Council voted to deny ex-fraternity members
‘the right to play for the Independent athletic teams in
the college intramural sports organization. This ruling,
in the final analysis, denies some 19 inactives the privi-
|lege of participating in any non-varsity sport.

The IMAC voted in a loophole however. A second
regulation states that inactives may play for their fra-
ternity teams IF their fraternities are willing. This
ruling actually does not alleviate the situation at all.
The majority of the inactive athletes are ex-members
of the same fraternity, and the local chapter of this
group has issued a letter stating that all fraternity
members who go inactive forfeit the privileges not
only of playing on the fraternity athletic teams but
of lisiening to the fraternity’s newly-acquired hi-fi set.

WE HAVE NO QUARREL with the fraternity for

inadequacy of the

IMAC’s alternate

Actually, the “loophole” is ridiculous. Why should
a man who has gone inactive, or has “gone indepen-

dent’

even want to play for his ex-fraternity’s team?

With perhaps one or two exceptions, all of the in-
actives resigned their fraternity status because they
were dissatisfied with the system, and they are not
likely to want to remain a part of if even on an athletic

basis.

WHY DID THE IMAC. pull the rug out from under
the Independents? Dave Warden, an outspoken. inactive
whose first reaction to the ruling was unprintable, con-
tends that the fraternities were afraid of being beaten
too often by the traditionally impotent Independent

teams.

Another theory is that the vote was lead by the
smaller fraternities because the Independents are cus-
tomarily the only team they can beat.

An irate Independent charges that Coach Heath
Whittle spearheaded the vote for reasons of his own.
Another nén-fraternity man maintains that the rule
is “a concerted effort to chastise the rebellious ele-
ment in the fraternity system” (see Letters to the

Editor.)

A strong fraternity argument was that once a
man is in a fraternity, he is technically always a mem-
ber regardless of whether or not he is active or in-

active.

WHATEVER THE REASONS, we feel that the ruling
is inescapably unfair, not only to the true “independents”
but to. the inactives who have for all practical purposes,

become independents.

“The rule denies ‘inactives the privilege of playing
an organized non-varsity sport—and we consider it the
main objective of the IMAC to provide everyone the

opportunity to participate.

We urge the IMAC representatives to reconsider
Davidson to play next Tuesday.| their position, taking into consideration not how many
Coach Scott commented that; games they will stand to lose as a result of participa-
tion of inactives, but how to achieve their main pur-
pose of giving everybody a chance to play.

Wrestlers Annihilate
Deacons In, Comeback

By TOMMY COLVIN

: Davidsonian Feature Editor
Within the last week the Davidson matmen marched to two victories, one an
18 - 15 win over Emory and the other a 29 - 0 rout of Wake Forest last Wednes-

day night.

Last Friday the local muscle- other

men journeyed to Atlanta for

their first meeting with Emory
this season. The Cats began the
afternoon by presenting the
hosts five points by means of

their usual forfeit in the 123-
pound class. In the next brac-
ket Buddy Brauch found him-
self decisioned by Ben Lacy,
bringing the score to 8-0 in
favor of Emory.

Tommy Brown then fell to
Don Sears.

However, as captain Milton
Gee stepped onto the mat, the
tide took a sudden change. With
the light weights, which have
been the weakest spot on the
team all year, behind them, the
Cats began to score.

Gee, wrestling at 147, reg-
istered the first points for the
visitors. He completely domi-
nated his match, piling up a
decisive 9-1 margin by the
final bell.

Butch LeDoyen added an-

three to the Davidson
column, squeaking by his op-
ponent with a 5-4 decision.
Next in line was Harry Brown,
who battled his man to a draw.

With Emory leading 15 to
8, Jim Alexander entered the
fray. Alexander completed

his match hastily, with a pin

in 2:16 of the first period.

Hefty Alex Porter clinched

victory by pinning his man in
four minutes. These five
points lifted Davidson past

Emory‘s fifteen, giving the
team its first victory of the
season.

Last Wednesday night the
Cats displayed their brawn by
completely mastering Wake
Forest. The squad did not for-
feit in the light weights, as the
Baptists were also unable to
produce a 123-pounder. All
seven Davidson wrestlers pa-
raded to easy victories.

The first match was the clos-
est of the evening with Buddy
Brauch outpointing kis oppon-

ent 13-9. Tommy Brown follow-
ed with the first pin of the
evening. Captain Gee, making
his first home appearance of
the year, proceded to nail his
man to the floor in 5:46.

Butch LeDoyen skillfully
tossed his opponent all over
the mat, but he was unable
to pull the final pin. Next
Harry Brown earned his first
victory of the year, decision-
ing Gordon Mercer 9-1.

John Ashburn, the Deacon’s
entry at.177, was thrice called
for stalling during the first
period. Ashburn entered the
match wearing a chest protec-
tor, and was obviously worried
about injuring. himself. Alex-
ander was awarded the match
by default when Ashburn let
out a cry of pain early in the
second period. The referee also
handed Porter a victory by de-
fault when the Baptists’ Hull
complained too vigorously about
Porter's leg hold when Porter
was pressing for a pin.
