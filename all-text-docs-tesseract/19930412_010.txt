The Shenandoah Shakespeare Express Brings Play to Life

By Allison Wright

The Shenandoah Shakespeare:
Express presented Bill at his finest.

Thursday afternoon in the 900
room.

With its fast-paced, contem-
porary, and often humorous ver-
sion of Antony and Cleopatra, the
company, composed of 12 ener-
getic young actors and actresses,
brought the play to life.

Performing in authentic
Shakespearean style with minimal
sets and costumes, a protruding
stage, and natural lighting, they
added creative touches (such as
their trademark hightops) to mod-
ernize the drama and make it appli-
cable to young audiences.

The minimalist costumes by
Dana Tietje were especially effec-
tive. An occasional flash of color
ina scarf, a striking white military

jacket or black bikers’ gloves were
layered over black shirts and pants
to creatively distinguish the char-
acters without distracting from the
substance of the play--the action,
expressions, and most importantly,
the words themselves.

The group let Shakespeare’s
language speak for itself through
their talented delivery.

Impeccable diction, perfect
timing and boundless energy es-
tablished the actors and actresses
as truly professional, not to men-
tion versatile, performers, as some
played up to four different roles.

Most impressive was the per-
formers’ ability to infuse the tragic
story of Antony and Cleopatra’s
ill-fated love with so much humor
and slapstick, while still deliver-
ing the passionate death scenes in
Acts IV and V with depth and

emotion.

Productions that can achieve
this blend of tragedy and comedy
with as much finesse as the
Shenandoah Shakespeare Express
are rare.

About five years ago at James
Madison University, Ralph Alan
Cohen, the director of Antony and
Cleopatra, co-founded the
Shenandoah Shakespeare Express
along with the managing director,
Jim Warren.

In their program, the SSE says
that “replicating the original con-
ditions of Shakespeare’s theater
produces the energy, muscularity,
and pace that make the plays work
like new entertainments.” Operat-
ing under this belief, the company
now tours all over the country per-
forming and leading classroom
workshops on Shakespeare’s lan-

performance delighted the audi-

ence and hopefully they will visit
Davidson on their next tour.

Poetry ... Jennifer A. Neale
In His Sanctuary

In a quiet sanctuary

he sits with his pen
and paper—

with his brown cravat
and dark tweed slacks.

In his silent sanctuary

he can yet hear

the sounds outside of himself—
the taunts,

the jeers,

and everything that tells him

he is false.

A mutant presence.

He is not wanted,

though he is a part of it all.

He cannot break the structure
though his ties grow-weaker—
jolt after jolt—

always in conflict

with the heavy

heavy body.

His arms stretch out

and out, holding...

And will they separate

these bindings?

Will they snap

under the weight of

his beard?

He does not dare ask.

He does not dare move

from his precarious position.

Yet still he grows heavier
as the food

for despair

invades his soul,

as the silence

wraps itself around him,

And his pen and paper

fall to the floor.

And his hands cover his eyes,
cover his nose,

cover his lips,

as he again suppresses

his cries.

Jennifer Neale won the 1993
R. Windley Hall Writing Award.
