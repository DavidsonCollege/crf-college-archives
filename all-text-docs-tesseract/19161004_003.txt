HOLLISTER WINS MEDAL

The following from the “Charlotte
Observer” of September 27th will be of
especial interest to the friends of Wil-
liam Hollister, 16, who is now studying
medicine at Johns Hopkins:

“The North Carolina Society of the
Sons of the American Revolution offered
this year a gold medal to the students of
the University, Colleges and High
Schools of North Carolina for the best
essay in the subject. ‘Brigadier-General
William Bryan, of Craven County, N.
C.’ The gold medal was won by Wil-
liam Hollister, of New Bern, N. C..
who is a great-great-great-grandson of
Brigadier General William Bryan. ‘The
essay of William Hollister is quite an
addition to the Revolutionary history of
North Carolina, and should be _ filed
among the collections being made by the/
Historical Commission.”

JOSEPH E. HENDERSON

Friends will learn with sorrow of the
death on September 25 of Mr. Joseph
E. Henderson, formerly of Mecklen
burg county, but for a number of years
a resident of St. Louis, Mo. ‘The fol-
lowing notice comes from a Charlorte
paper:

“A telegram was received by friends
here yesterday (September 25th) an-
nouncing the death in St. Louis of Mr.
1. F. Henderson. He was a son of the
late McKnit Henderson and Louisa
Herron Henderson, of Stecle Creek. and
was sixty-eight years of age. Mr. Hen-
derson entered Davidson College after
attending preparatory school in Steele
Creek and = graduated in 1871. He
studied surveving and surveyed the route
of the Air Line Railway between Char-
lotte and Atlanta in 1872. Later he
went West and settled in Dallas, Tex..
where he became one of the most promi-
nent men of that city. About 1893 he
moved to St. Louis, Md., where he has
since resided.” ffl

being organized at the different colleges

cratic leaders will make an address herc./L. §. Pattersem, - -
