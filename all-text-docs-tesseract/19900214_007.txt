Thursday, February 8, the
Wildcats journeyed to
Greenville,S.C. to take on the
Paladins of Furman. Despite
placing five men in double fig-
ures, committing fewer turn-
overs and gleaning more steals
than their opponents, the ‘Cats
fell to defeat, 87-76, because
they were plagued by poor
field goal shooting (42.6 per-
cent) and rebounding (36 re-

bounds to 49 for Furman).
Davidson was outscored 18-
6 in the opening six minutes,
and despite whittling the mar-
- gin to four points with ten
minutes remaining in the
opening half, trailed by a 43-28
score at halftime. Furman ex-
tended the lead past 20 points
in the opening minutes of the
second stanza, prompting
Wildcats’ coach Bob McKillop
to instruct his players to begin
fouling to stop the clock with
more than ten minutes left in
the: contest. The Paladins
ended up visiting the free
throw line 51 times, converting
35 tries to bury the ‘Cats. Paul
Denmond’s 19 points and 6
rebounds, and Alan Hunter’s

15 points led the Davidson ef-

fort.

Saturday night against Mi-
ami of Florida, a Belk Arena
crowd of 1,693 saw the Wild-
cats dominate the first half with
patient offense and suffocating
defensive pressure. That pa-
tience rewarded the ‘Cats with
near 50 percent shooting anda
34-26 lead at the intermission.
The home team’s fine play and
the surprise visit of Terry Hol-
land to Baker Sports Complex
had the Wildcat faithful hop-
ing for the end of the Davidson
losing streak. Oh well.

Miami coach Bill Foster
switched to a smaller, faster
quintet for the second twenty
minutes, and that lineup came
out on fire. A 17-4 spurt to
begin the half gave the Hurri-
canes a lead they would never
relinquish, though the ‘Cats
scratched to within 56-53 on a
basket by Detlef Musch with
4:58 remaining. Though they
shot poorly in the second half,
the 72-64 defeat did notinvolve
alate collapse on the partof the
Wildcats. It was, rather, the
Hurricanes’ torrid three-point
shooting (11 of 18) that pro-
vided the knockout punch.

Said McKillop, “You can live

wa Wildcats Fall to Paladins
and Hurricaines

by the three-pointer or die by it.
In the first half they were miss-
ing it, but you,see what hap-
pened when they started hit-
ting it.” Leading the way for
Miami was freshman Samarr
Logan, who feasted on the
three-pointer. He finished 7 of
8 from the field, including a
perfect 5 of 5 from three-point
range,.and scored 23 points.

Meanwhile, freshman center |
Detlef Musch was having a
career night carving up Mi-
ami’s inside players.McKillop
explained: “We spread our of-
fense and tried to get the ball
into him as much as we possi-
bly could.”

The Musch-man responded
with career highs of 27 points
and 18 rebounds, impressive
statistics thatearned him status

‘as the ECAC Independent

Rookie of the week. Sopho-
more guard Paul Denmond,
steady as always, contributed
13 points, 5 rebounds and 4
assists to the Davidson cause.
The ‘Cats, now 2-20, return to
the road this week in search of
their first win away from
home, with games Thursday at
Winthrop and Monday at Mi-

Baseball wins first two

By GIGGY MAXWELL

The Davidson Wildcat baseball team
opened its season this past Sunday de-
feating the UNC-Asheville Bulldogs in
both games of their double header by
the scores of 3- land 1 - 0.

In the opener, pitcher Greg Wilcox
started off shakily as he gave up two-
out walks in each of the first two in-
nings. His control problems continued
in the third as he walked the first batter
on four straight pitches. He followed
that walk witha strikeout but gaveupa
single to the next batter and then gave
up another four pitch walk to load the
bases. A-slick 4-6-3 double play exe-
cuted by MikioAoki, Rob Eenhoornand
Joseph Azzolino got Wilcox out of the

In the meantime the Wildcat offense
struggled against UNC-Asheville
pitcher, Rick Honeycutt, as he faced the
minimum nine batters through three.

UNC Asheville finally broke the scor-
ing drought in the fourth on a walk,
stolen base and a run scoring single. It
was the last run they would score all
day. ;

In Davidson’s half of the fourth, Een-

hoorn led off with a single. Honeycutt
balked him to second. Ron Krnacik fol-
lowed with a bunt single to. give the
Wildcats runners on first and third and
nobody out. Aoki then grounded intoa

double play which allowed Eenhoorn:

to score.

Ralph Isernia opened the fifth inning
witha single and was quickly sacrificed
to second. A stolen base put Isernia on
third where_he eventually came home
on a single by Eenhoorn.

The sixth inning saw Krnacik and
Aoki put together back to back doubles
which gave the Wildcats their final
margin of victory in the opener, 3 - 1.

Wilcox pitched six innings to pick up

the win and Brad Wanzenberg pitched
the seventh for the save.

In the nightcap, Dave Williams, Jim
Stanfill and Derek Twombly combined
topitchatwo-hitshut-out. The lonerun
was scored during a two-out rally in the
fourth. Aoki singled and promptly stole
second base. His jump was so big it

didn’t even draw a throw from the-

Bulldog catcher. Peter Hughes’ subse-
quent RBI single was all the Wildcats
needed.

Hughes almost put Davidson on the
board in the second inning as his tower-
ing drive came up five feet short of
clearing the 395 foot centerfield fence.

Williams pitched five innings for the
win and Derek Twombly got the final
three outs for the save.

The Wildcats are off until this week-
end when they face Pfeiffer on Friday at
3:00. Saturday, they meet Radford in a
double header at 1:00. The Cats meet
Radford again at 2:00 on Sunday.

Go watch the baseball team play
Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

bs the sports front

A meeting of the Trustees has
been called for February 22 to dis-
cuss. Davidson’s future conference
affiliation. And while nothing is
sure until the Trustees make it so, it
seems likely that the future of
Davidsonathletics, save for football,
lies in the Big South Conference.
Despite the fact that conferences
such as the Sun Belt Conference and
the Southern Conference maintain
higher profiles, the Big South seems
to be the best fit in terms of the size
and geographic location of member
schools.

Those member schoolsare Coastal
Carolina,. Campbell, UNC-
Asheville, Winthrop, Augusta, Bene
tist and Radford.

The Big South holds conference
championships in baseball, volley-
ball, soccer and basketball, among
other sports, and beginning in 1992,

‘a victory in the conference men’s
basketball tournament will be re-
warded by anautomatic berth in the

B’ball in the Big South?

- following his Virginia team’s loss at

ami of Ohio.

NCAA Basketball Tournament.
Davidson football, on the other
hand, seems headed toward the Ol
Dominion Athletic Conference, a
Division III conference whose
members include Hampden-
Sydney, Randolph-Macon and
Washington and Lee. iB
Terry Holland should have much
to say about this issue and many
others when he takes over as Ath-
letic Director, and I must say it was
great to see him at Saturday’s bas-
ketball game. Holland was in Char-
lotte foremost for personal business

Clemson, but he did manage to stop
in at the game and to meet with
Davidson’s women’s coaches, Os-
tensibly to discuss with them the
distribution of scholarships among
women’s sports at Davidson.

Allof this leaves me confident that
he is commencing already to work
his magic upon the Davidson ath-
letic program. And that can foretell
only good things ahead.
