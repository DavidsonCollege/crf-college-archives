George Breece running an uphill race for Secretary of State

By FRANK SANTORE
‘Staff Writer

“I’ve been to ninety-one
counties in the past 107 days
with twelve days off—all Sun-
days,” George Breece, a candi-
date for N.C. Secretary of
State, tells this reporter two
seconds after meeting him. -

A former state legislator from
Cumberland County, Breece
has been involved in almost
every activity which the North
Carolina Democratic Party has
undertaken in the past twelve
years: At the tender age of
twenty-two, he was a state and
national coordinator for Hubert
Humphrey’s ’68 campaign. Ac-
tive in the N.C. Young Demo-
crats, he helped Jim Hunt rise
to power in that organization; a
fact he never fails to mention
when speaking of the Governor
and his long-time friendship
with same. He has been chosen
as one of North Carolina’s Ten
Outstanding Young Men in_
times past, and was honored by
the North Carolina Jaycees for
his role in the Jaycees’ Interna-
tional Relief fund for Honduras
in 1975.

After serving only one term
in the state legislature—he led
the ticket in Cumberland Coun-

ty in the 1974 general election— ,

Breece decided to challenge
North Carolina’s Mr. Demo-
crat,’’ incumbent Secretary of
State Thad Eure, for the post
which Mr. Eure held, and still

holds to this day.

When asked about his lack of
governmental experience,
Breéce made the point that
Eure, when chosen Secretary of
State in 1935 in order to fill a
job vacancy, had served the
same number of terms in.the
state House of Representa-
tives—one—which he had
served...and was actually de-
feated for a second term in 1934.

Thus armed with familiar
campaign signs, which the Fay-
etteville Disabled American
Veterans made for him at a cost
of 25 cents each, Breece can-
vassed the state in 1976, fight-
ing against what he perceives as
the Democratic party establish-
ment. As he drove from Manteo
to Murphy, from Watauga to
Wilmington, Breece would
hammer his wooden signs into
any willing tree trunk (‘‘One-
third of them are still up,”’ he
estimates, “and I’ve changed
the date on half of them.’’( This
process of hard campaigning
brought him 47% of the vote in
the '76 Democratic primary, a
grand accomplishment for a
political novice.

When speaking of his 1976
campaign, Breece shows a deep-
rooted resentment against what
he implies were unethical prac-
tices in the Eure campaign,
such as using campaign pic-
tures which were twenty years
old. He vows that this time

Constitutional Amendment

The following is a memorandum
from College President Samuel
Spencer’s office:

The following amendments
to the Constitution were sug-
gested by the Constitutional
Review Committee. They. were
received as information by the
Trustees in October and will be
voted upon at the February
meeting, February 21-22, of the
Board. Comments on these
proposed amendments should
be made to the President's
Office before this time.

Proposed Amendments
1. Substitute the title “Center
for Special Studies” wherever
“‘Center for Honor Studies’

2 Delete Article I, Section 4,

and insert in lieu thereof the
following sentence: ‘‘Admini-
strative officers have the pow-
ers and duties delegated to
them by the President.”

3. In Article VIII, Sections
3.b., 4.c., and 5.b., substitute
“the Honor Code and the Code
of Responsibility’’ for “‘Code of
Responsibility.”

4: At the end of Article VIII,
Section 5.a., add the following
sentence: ‘The Chairman of the
Hearing Committee sits with
the council in an advisory
capacity with the privilege of
the floor but without vote.”

5. In Article VIII, Section 5.b.,
Paragraph 2, add ‘‘or his dele-
gates”’ after ‘‘the Council meets
with the President.”

“things are going to be differ-
ent.”” That resoluteness forces
him, drives him to keep run-
ning...and running...and run-
ning.

The Secretary of State post,
which Thad Eure has held since
1935, is one which requires
many mundane tasks of its
occupant. Chartering corpora-
tions, issuing lobby and notary
public licenses, and swearing in
some minor officials: all these
make for a rather bland daily

agenda for any person elected to ~

North Carolina’s Secretary of
State post.

Breece, however, feels that
the. Secretary of State can do
more for North Carolina’s ‘‘sun-
shine,” or open-meeting laws to
the Council of State (i.e. the
Governor and his cabinet). Af-
ter such a bill was passed in the
North Carolina House, Secre-
tary of State Eure went before a
Senate committee to argue a-
gainst said extension, a bill
which even Governor Jim Hunt
favors. The bill was not re-
ported out. of committee, and
Breece feels that Eure’s influ-
ence was the primary reason.

In. addition, Breece has at-
tacked the inefficiency of the
Secretary of State’s office. He
uses two illustrations to drum
this fact home: the fact that
the Secretary’s office was the
only state office with a budget
increase during former Gover-
nor Holshouser’s cost-cutting
program in 1976, and the fact

that Eure maintains an office
three-and-a-half blocks from his
staff’s in Raleigh—the only
cabinet official to do so.

Although Breece states time
and again that age is not an
issue in the upcoming campaign
(Eure is over 80), he utters such
statements as “Back in 1936,
before any of you were born;”
and “I respect the Secretary,
but...’’ He even went so far as
to single out Davidson College
Democrat officer Bobby Ervin
and state that “Even by’s
grandad knew (when‘to get
out),’’ an obvious reference to
the younger Ervin’s distin-
guished grandfather, former
Senator Sam Ervin. But, as
Breece told this reporter, ‘‘Poli-
tics is a tough game.” In fact,
Breece’s campaign slogan,
“Give a Young Man a Chance,”
is the same slogan which Thad
Eure used in his first campaign
in 1976; a fact which Breece
never failed to mention when
speaking to DC’s Democratic
club.

If he loses this time -around,
Breece does not believe that he
will become persona non grata
in the North Carolina Democra-
tic party. Although he realizes
he is running an uphill race
against what he perceives to be
the party’s standard candidate,
a loss, Breece said, “‘will be
a setback, not: a defeat...I’m
going to keep on fighting.” One
can perceive that Breece might
stop one day...in the year 2100!
