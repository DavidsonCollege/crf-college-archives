To the Editor:

After agonized deliberation, I
have decided to re-enter public
life at Davidson. My agent and I
decided you should be the first
to know.

I accept the job as Assistant
to the President. At the moment
my schedule for next year looks
pretty open in spite of a series of
Key, Club Convention lectures.
But I’ve done things like this
before, you know.

And if Godbehere feels like
cutting out early in the spring to
go walk the Appalachian Trail
or something, I can probably
work it in even then.

I haven’t mastered the dialect
quite yet, but I’m real good with
rhetoric.

You may wonder why I’ve
given up retirement. You
shouldn’t though, because any
moron should understand.

It’s like this: I’m not through
with Davidson. I hate loose en-
ds. And brother, you’ve got
them around this dump. A
loose ended laundry; loose-
ended Trustees; loose-ended
students. A lot of CLUTTER,
don’t you see?

And besides, how can they
select N.C. Fellows without
me?

To the Editor:

Iam a little disturbed at your
printing the article on former
Dean of the Honors Center Earl
R. MacCormac for several
reasons.

It is customary to wait until
an office has a vacancy before
one runs for that office. I can
assure you there is no vacancy
filling the office now.

But the main reason I’m a bit
upset is this: I’m not sure if
you’re being serious or not. So
let me in on the idea. Is this a
joke or not? Come on, guys, you
can tell me. Really.

I guess it’s time to admit that

~e ete ett

ted since January haven’t been
quite serious.

We’ve been pulling your leg
all dlong, and you didn’t even
know it. Silly you! You kept
asking when we were going to
have a lampoon, and we passed
the five previous issues right
under your nose without you
suspecting a thing.

Therefore, we feel
necessary to run this retraction.
You can take this issue for
gospel and forget all those fun-
ny things about substandard

housing, admissions, and the

college endowment.
