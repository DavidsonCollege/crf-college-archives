office to send out address sheets to ev-
ery class of the past fifty years, thus
enabling each one to know where his as-
sociate is now located. This was done
for those classes which had re-unions
last year, and such favorable comment
was Received that it was thought advis-
able to do this for every class. Many
new addresses are obtained at the same

service to the classes.

Another new feature in the alumni work
this year is the adoption of the dues plan
of financing, in lieu of the Loyalty
League idea, which has been in operation
for two years, The latter provided for a
distribution of funds received into three
uses, viz: professors’ travel, athletics, and
alumni work, while the new. plan states
that all funds received will go toward
fostering alumni activity.

Three Alumni Meetings
in Florida Next Week

S.-G._N.-F. Association Also Meets
Tomorrow Night at Bainbridge
Georgia

The General Alumni Association of Da-
vidson College has planned a program of
organization this year which will cover
the entire South, and several Northern
points at which there are sufficient alum-
ni to perfect an organization. The aim
which has been set is forty associations,
as compared with the sixteen that were
re-organized or met at various times dur-
ing the past year.

The first meeting of this series will be

held tomorrow night when the S; G, N. F.
(South Georgia-North Florida) Alumni
Association will méet at a banquet in
Bainbridge, Ga. This territory covers
approximately fifteen cities or towns in
that immediate section.
’ Plans at this meeting will be made to
attend the football game with the Uni-
versity of Florida at Gainesville on Oc-
tober Ist, and efforts will be made to form
a motor cavalcade at Madison, Fla., which
is one hundred miles from Gainesville. J.
J. J. Love, ’19, of Quincy, Fla., will act as
toastmaster,.

Next Tuesday Ernest Milton, Alumni
Secretary, will leave for Jacksonville,
Fla., to begin the organization of three
Alumni Associations in Florida; The
first one will be held at Jacksonville
Wednesday night, September 28th, at
which point many former Davidson men
reside, ,

The following night an organization
will be perfected at Orlando, Fla., which
will take care of the Davidson alumni in
the central section of the “Sunshine
State,” while the Florida’ West Coast
alumni will be organized at St. Peters-
burg on Friday, which will then be the
farthest point south where Davidson has
an alumni organization. An insufficient
number of alumni will prevent an asso-
ciation on the east coast of Florida.

J. D. Baker, Jr., is in charge of the
arrangements at Jacksonville; Z. N. Hol-
ler, who resides at Sanford, is making ar-
rangements at Orlando, while C. R. An-
derson is taking care of the St. Pters-
burg organization,
