Poll Of Top Scholars
Shows Dissatisfaction

By CHARLES CHASTAIN, Davidsonian Associate Editor

(Editor's note: recently a poll was taken at Wofford College among the nineteen
students with the highest academic averages, askirig them what they thought of the
quality of the education they were receiving. Almost to a man, they were very dis-
satisfied. The DAVIDSONIAN has conducted a similar poll among Davidson students.

The results are printed below.)
This week the five students in each class with

Student Council
Begins Action

Davidson's 1958-59 Student
Council moved into action Mon-
day night, holding its
mecting under the administra-
tion of Student Body president
John Kuykendall. The council,
meeting in a brief organization-

first| four mentioned

opinion that, with exceptions,
academic work at Davidson was
definitely not intellectually
stimulating and that a large
portion of it was “busy work.’

One senior in this group
commented that “the empha-
sis is on memorizing the notes
and re-gurgitating on tests...
For those who do not use dis-
cretion, a fantastic amount of
time is utterly useless busy
work!"

Another senior said that most
work was dull and that “the
teaching process of too many
professors consists solely of
spooning factual pabulum_ to
students, demanding only that
it be spewed back on reviews.”

2. What do you consider
the chief advantage of Da-
vidson, as opposed to any
other schools?

The most frequently men.
tioned advantages were David-
son’s status as a small college
and the close, personal relations
between faculty and students,
with individual attention to
student problems, with nine stu-
dents naming the first and
eight the second.

Four students thought that a
chief advantage of Davidson
was its good student body, and
its high aca-
demic standards. “Good facul-
ty” was the comment of three,
and the school’s physical plant
and facilities were named by

making the 1958-59 year “the|

No legislative action was tak-
en in the short meeting and
discussion was limited to gen-
eral objectives for the coming
year and a report from coun-
cil members on increased in-
cidences of theft on the campus
in recent weeks.

President Kuykendall set
weekly meeting time for the
council ‘for Monday nights at
7 p.m. and issued an invitation
to all students to attend coun-
mil meetings.

Other officers for the next

vice-president; Dabney

treasurer.

first

Five students said that Da-
vidson’s chief advantage was its
religious and moral atmosphere,
or its relation with the church.
As a sophomore put it, “David-
son still cares enough to ex-
press its belief in a moral and
educational ideal.”

Other advantages designated
were the honor system, the gen-
eral lack of favoritism towards
students by professors, and the
well-rounded type of education
offered.

3. What do you consider
the chief disadvantage of
Davidson?

Seven students found the
chief disadvantage to be in the

is merit in our plan. However,
the Faculty is not pushing for
a Revised Bidding System at
all. They are leaving the de-
cision entirely up to the stu-
dents:

ANDERSON

Revised Bidding System

Purpose: It is the purpose of this revised bidding
system to aid in stabilizing fraternity size in order
to help fraternities maintain a number of brothers
which will be most easily manageable in the new fra-
ternity court, especially with regard to finances. The
system would rather therefore allow fraternities to
concentrate more on quality bidding rather than
quantity bidding This system is so constructed that
it may achieve this purpose while at the same time
retain as many of the principle characteristics of the
present system as possible.

Outline of the system:

1. Rush week will be conducted as usual, with
the usual procedures of return dates after the
first series of rush parties.

. At the completion of rush week, all fraternities
will issue a list of their bidding preferences in
the following manner:

a. Each fraternity will list its twenty first
choices.

s

. Each fraternity will list thereafter its
choices in groups of five in descending order
of groups number 2, 3, 4, ete.

c. A fraternity will be able to submit as many
or as few groups of this nature as it wishes.

d. These lists will be given to the [FC the morn-

ing after the last rush party.

At the completion of rush week, the rushees
will list their fraternity preferences in descend-_
ing order, 1, 2, and 3. A rushee may list only one
fraternity, two, or three, according to his.
wishes. However, a listing will constitute a
pledge that if the rushee receives a bid from
one of these fraternities, he will join that fra-
ternity. Penalty for breaking this pledge will
be restriction from joining any fraternity for
one year.

The order of selection after the IFC receives
the fraternity lists and the rushee lists will
be as follows:

Rushee Fraternity
1

2
etc.
1
2
etc.
1
2
ete.

After a fraternity has received 20 names by
this matching process, the operation will be
terminated for that fraternity unless one of its

groups has not been completed. In that event,
