John P. McKnight, Davidson
Man, Writes of Revolution

Is Head of the Associated Press
Bureau in Havana, Cuba

WAS PHI BETA KAPPA

Tells of Harrowing Experiences
of Members of Press in “Cov-
ering” Revolution

John P. McKnight, '28, head of the
Associated Press Bureau Havana,
Cuba, has led a rather exciting life for
the past several months. He ‘has cov-
ered the Cuban revolution, which has
been on the headlines of all American
papers recently.

While at Davidson, Johnny was a
member of Phi Beta Kappa and of the

in

Delta Theta Chi local fraternity,
which has since become Phi Delta
Theta. He is a brother of W. A. Me-

Knight, who graduated in the class of
1932.

In a recent Associated Press story,
McKnight tells of the difficulties of
the press in the revolution. He says
of the time just preceding November
10,“ Working for 48 hours with almost
no food or sleep to give the American
press the fullest accounts of the revo-
lution, the staff has been exposed to
death many times.”

McKnight continues with the story
by saying that his companion, E, A.
Chester, took over the office while he,
McKnight, went to the Hotel Park-
view to get a better view of the events
taking place there.

“At 1:30 a. m,, the firing broke out
along the Prado and a rebel airplane
swooped down over the city. I saw
first hand the daring maneuvers of the
plane and the tracer bullets sent whin-
ing in its wake by machine gunners
on the ground.”

than recounts the hazardous

man, Chester, took from the American
embassy back to the office.

“Garcia worked under fire all Wednes-

men fell dead and about
him.”

The story on the activities of the
Cuban press is concluded with, “ While
these men were ‘covering’ the various
phases of the fighting outside, I kept
the story of the battle going to the
outside world from their telephone ac-
counts received at the office, and, all
the while, there was constant sniping

WILDKITTENS TO
ENCOUNTER DUKE

The Davidson Wildkittens will play
their last game of the season Saturday,
when they meet the Duke freshmen at
Asheville, the contest being sponsored
by a charity organization of that city.

Although expecting a hard game,
Davidson coaches are inclined to be
more confident when speaking of the
coming encounter, due to the decided
improvement shown by the 'Kittens in
the 32-0 drubbing they gave the Wof-
ford yearlings last Friday.

The Blue Imps, who have one of
the strongest teams in the state, and
who are at the present time unde-
feated, will be favored to win. The
Wildkitten record, with one victory,
two defeats, and one tie, is not so im-
pressive, but the "Kittens are expected
to display—an—attack which will-make
the game close.

Davidson mentors have been putting
the men through thorough workouts,
stress being laid on blocking, tackling,
and the timing of plays. The playing
of Corbin, Garrison, and Sadler, ’Kit-
ten backs who participated in their
first regular game last Friday, was es-
pecially gratifying to the coaches,

The Wildkittens should be able to
put their full strength on the field next
Saturday, none of the men having been
injured in last week's play. The Duke
team will have a decided weight ad-
vantage, especially in the backfield.

COURSE IN BLUFFING
The University of Washington is giv-
ing a course in “bluffing.” t is given
in conjunction with the English and

present at the meeting, as will Dr. J.
W. MacConnell, college physician at
Davidson.

There are over forty Davidson men
at. Union Seminary, and with this nu-
cleus it is expected that a good meet-
ing will be held.

The gath@ting is to be on the night
the William and Mary game
which is to be played at Williamsburg
the following day.

ALL-AMERICANS DEFEAT
HUNTERSVILLE GRID STARS

Led by “Swede” Johnson, the “ All-
Americans” chalked up an 18-0 victory
over the Huntersville All-Stars last
Tuesday on Richardson Field.

The game, which did not start until
late, was not finished, due to approach-
ing darkness. Only three quarters
were played, but this provided plenty
of time for the Reserves to score.

The Huntersville team, led’ by Fred
Fleagle, former Davidson back,
showed surprising strength in the first
quarter, but soon crumpled before the

a

strong offense of the “ All-Americans.”

All three touchdowns were made by
Johnson. Two scores came as a result
of a successful aerial attack, while the
third score was made by the intercept-
ing of a Huntersville pass.

Johnson in the backfield and Young
in the line were outstanding for the
“All-Americans,” while Fleagle ap-
peared to be the mainstay of the Hun-
tersville team.

This Friday the -* All-Americans”
will play Mountain Park Junior Col-
lege on Richardson Field at 3 o'clock.
The Mountaineers will bring a strong
aggregation to the local field.  Al-
though the “All-Americans” will be
without the services of Newton, Lay,
and McClung, regular linemen, because
of eligibility rules, the “BY team will
be favored to capture this contest. The
reserves have never been beaten in a
regular scheduled game and hope to
make this record more impressive by
winning Friday.

Mecklenburg County Alumni
Have Interesting Meeting

Colonel E. L. Baxter Davidson

JACKSON MAKES TALK
ea eS

Dr. J. M. Walker, Pastor at
Steele Creek, Makes
Address

“Davidson alumni in Mecklenburg
County gathered last Friday night at
the Chamber of Commerce in Char-
lotte for a dinner and a_ meeting.
Colonel E. L. Baxter Davidson was
elected president of the Mecklenburg
Chapter of Davidson alumni, Dr. T.
D. Sparrow was elected vice-president,
and J. B. Kuykendall was named sec-
retary and treasurer.

Following the turkey dinner, an in-
teresting program was presented, in-
cluding numbers by the Pills Brothers,
an unusual Davidson trio, numbers by
the saxophone quartet, and songs by
the college voice quartet.

Mr. F, L. Jackson, treasurer of the
college, talked to the former students
on the changing emphasis in college
education. Mr. Jackson said that the
change had come about in the last sev-
eral years, and that men now sought
a college education for its cultural
value more than for its potential mon-
etary value. He said that this is par-
ticularly true of Davidson. The treas-
urer reviewed conditions at the college,
laying particular emphasis on David-
son’s rating and on the famous honor
system at the school:

Dr. J. M. Walker, pastor of the
Steele Creek Presbyterian Church,
spoke to the chapter on the need for
an alumni association in Mecklenburg
County. Dr. Walker gave some inter-
esting reminiscences, concerning par-
ticularly the early football teams at
Davidson.

Dr. W. L. Lingle, president of Da-
vidson, made a few remarks, asking
that the alumni in the county send the
best boys available to the college, em-
phasizing the fact that not only ath-
letes, but scholars, musicians, debaters,
and other fine students are also needed.

Judge E. McA. Currie, retiring presi-
dent of the Charlotte alumni,
toastmaster for the dinner.

Besides Dr. Lingle, many members
of the Davidson faculty attended the
meeting. Colonel Davidson, class of
1880; Dr. C. R. Harding, class of 1880,
and Dr. J. P. Munroe, class of 1882,
were the oldest alumni in attendance.
