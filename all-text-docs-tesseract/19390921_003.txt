Last year it could
be seen many times as lighter Da-

a standstill until the freshness of
rival reserves, something which the
'Cats always lack, told too heavily.
Again this year eleven men will
be out there fighting, backed by
a few more reserves, still a team
that can pull surprises, a team that
will be fighting back a heavier op-
ponent. A great percentage of the
student body will be present in the
