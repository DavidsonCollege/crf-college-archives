College Girls Respect Davidson Parties

Editor's Note: The following
is excerpted from a Winston.
Salem Journal and Sentinel
of college girls’ opinions about
the husband-hunting prospects
in North Carolina.

The men at Davidson College
are intelligent and work hard,
but ‘‘when they party, they
PARTY!,” said a Salem jun.
jor.

College girls across the state
agree with her.

A UNC journalism major
reports ‘‘really great week-
end dates’ at Davidson. The
Davidson gentlemen, ‘‘a real-
ity at least on big weekends,”
are.“‘so determined to have a
good time and so thrilled to
have girls’ on campus that
their enthusiasm may wear
you out.”

Another Carolina coed was
less enthusiastic about her

big weekend at Davidson. She
described it. this way:

“Dating on campus for a
big weekend there is like go-
ing out of a quiet room into
a world of hungry people just
released from strict diets —
a definite frantic effort to
raise hell and get your
money's worth."

“You'll have to spend the
night in a vacated boys’
dorm,’ warned a Duke coed,
“and don't expect to see your
date ‘til after lunch. He'll be
conscientiously at class.”

“Davidson boys are smart,
but immature.” said a Duke
girl. “They have a preference
for country music, alpaca
sweaters and ties, and conven-
tional girls in flowered dress-
es."

Girls at several of the
schools complained about the

conceit of Davidson males.
But a UNC-Chapel Hill reli-
gion major defended them.
“The boys carry prestige just
by going to the school,’ she
said.

“If a boy has gone to David-
son, chances are that he is
very rich, well-rounded ‘and
smart.’ added a State girl.
“Davidson has the cream of
the crop.” agreed another.

But the boys are apparently
not the state's top college-age
Casanovas.

“Ifa Davidson boy looks
deeply into your eyes,” said
a Duke girl. ‘he'll probably
propose a bridge game.”

Council Discusses

A Homecoming bonfire com.

the Freshman Council in the

ONCE MORE UNTO THE BREACH

a! Way back in 1953 I started writing this column about
campus life. Today, a full 13 years later, Lam still writing
this column, for my interest in undergraduates is as keen
and lively as ever. This is called “arrested development.’

But where else can a writer find a subject as fascinating
& as the American campus? Where else are minds so nettled,
‘bodies so roiled, psyches so unglued?
Right now, for example, though the new school year has
just begun, you've already encountered the following dis-
te:

asters:

1. You hate your teachers.

2. You hate your courses.

8. You hate your room-mates.

4. You have no time to study.

6. You have no place to study.

Friends, let us, without despair, examine your problems
one by one.

1. You hate your teachers. For shame, friends! Try
looking at things their way. Take your English teacher,
for instance. Here’s’a man who js one of the world’s
‘Authorities on Robert Browning, yet he wears $30 tweeds
and a pre-war necktie while his brother Sam, a high school
dropout, earns 70 thou a year in aluminum siding. Ia it so
hard to understand why he writes “F” on top of your
themes and “Eeeyich!” in the margin? Instead of hating
him, should you not admire his dedication to scholarship,
his disdain for the blandishments of commerce? Of course
you should. You may flunk, but Pippa passes.

2. You hate your courses. You say, for example, that
you don’t see the use of studying Macbeth when you are
majoring in veterinary medicine. You're wrong, friends.
Believe me, some day when you are running a bus kennel,
you'll be mighty glad you learned “Out, damned Spot!

3. You hate your room-mates. This {s, unquestionably,
a big problem—in fact, the second biggest problem on
American campuses. (The first biggest, of course, is on
which side of your mortar board do you dangle the tassel
at Commencement?) But there is an answer to the room-
mate problem: keep changing room-mates. The optimum
interval, I have found, is every four hours.

4. You have no time to study. Friends, I’m glad to re-
port there is a simple way to find extra time in your busy
schedule. All you have to do is buy some Personna Super
Stainless Steel Blades. Then you won’t be wasting pre-
cious hours hacking away with inferior blades, mangling
your face again and again in a tedious, feckless effort to
winnow your whiskers. Personna shaves you quickly and
slickly, easily and breezily, hacklessly, scrapelessly, tug-
lessly, nicklessly, scratchlessly, matchlessly. Furthermore,
Personna Blades last and last. Moreover, they are avail-
able both in double-edge and Injector style. And, as if this
weren't enough, Personna is now offering you a chance to
grab a fistful of $100 bills. The Personna Super Stainless
Steel Sweepstakes is off and running! You can win $10,000
and even more. Get over to your Personna dealer for de-
tails and an entry blank. Don’t just stand there!

5. You have no place to study. This ie a thorny one, I'll
admit, what with the library so jammed and the dorms so
noisy. But with a little ingenuity, you can still find a quiet,
deserted spot—like the ticket office of the lacrosse team.
Or a testimonial dinner for the dean. Or the nearest re-
cruiting station.

Main St. Davidson you another year of Max Shulman’s uninhibited, uncen-
sored column.

This is Russ Kennedy of Balboa Island, California, on an in-port field trip as a student aboard
Chapman College's floating campus.

The note he paused to make as fellow students went ahead to inspect Hatshepsut’s Tomb in the
Valley of the Kings near Luxor, he used to complete an assignment for his Comparative World
Cultures professor. .

Russ transferred the 12 units earned during the study-travel semester at sea to his record at
the University of California at Irvine where he continues studies toward a teaching career in life
sciences.

As you read this, 450 other students have begun the fall semester voyage of discovery with
Chapman aboard the s.s. RYNDAM, for which Holland-America Line acts as General Passenger
Agents.

8 In February still another 450 will embark from Los Angeles for the spring 1967 semester,
this time bound for the Panama Canal, Venezuela, Brazil, Argentina, Nigeria, Senegal, Morocco,
Spain, Portugal, The Netherlands, Denmark, Great Britain and New York.
