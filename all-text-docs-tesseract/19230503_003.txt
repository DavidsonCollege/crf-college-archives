Cause For Doubt

There was an all-round good-for-nothing
man who died, and at his funeral the min-
ister delivered a most beautiful address, eu-
logizing the departed in the most glowing
manner, praising his splendid qualities as:a
fine type of man, a good husband and kind
parent.

About this time the widow, who was seated
well up in front, spoke to her little daugh-
ter by her side, and said, “My dear, go look

in the coffin and sce if it is your father.”

HALL OF FAME

No. 16
Louis Harrison Anderson, ’15
Football** Track

Davidson has always taken great pride
in the men that have gone forth from her
walls and especially those who have
shown a versatility in their college life
that have enabled them to rise in the es-
timation and esteem of their fellows.
Louis Anderson was no exception to this
rule, as can be attested by the enviable
record that he gained for himself while
he was a wearer of the Red and Black.
He was prominent in student ac-
tivities as well as on the gridiron and on
the cinder path and was one of the most
popular members of his class.

Anderson played on the scrubs his
Freshman year and then was one of the
consistent and hardy players on the Var-
sity his last three years. Six feet two
inches tall and built up to suit, he held
the right and left tackle positions to suit
the taste of Bill Fetzer, under whom he
was trained as a fighting Wildcat. Good
steady-playing tackles were always the
articles that Davidson stood in. need.
This tall and rangy lad, while not so
heavy as many that he bucked up against
in the line, more than held his own in
every game that he played. The annual
for 1915, the year of his graduation said
that he had plenty of fight and that the
longer he played the stronger he got. He
could be depended to do his share of the
line attack and defense every time. An
unfortunate accident in the shape of a
broken ankle kept him out of the two last
games of the ’18 season but he came back
stronger than ever the next two years.
At a game played in Charlotte, The Ob-
server said of him, “The big tackle An-
derson was a tower of strength in the
line.”

Anderson developed into a track star
during his sojourn at Davidson and in one
of the meets during his last year was the
high point man of the team. In the
meet with the University of South Caro-
lina, he won the discus throw, hammer
throw, shot put, tied the high jump and
was second in several other places.

He was elected President of the So-
phomore class and held several other
trustworthy positions among them being
a member of the Executive Committee of
the Athletic Association, Class Histor-
ian, Vice-President “D” club, and a
member of the Gryphon Club. He be-
longed to the Beta Theta Phi fraternity.
He made many friends on the campus
and in the class rooms, while his genial
personality made him popular wherever
he appeared. He was also elected mana-
ger of the Varsity track team.

Louis was one of the first volunteers
for service overseas and served with dis-
tinction throughout the time that the
United States held the Boche line back
from the fields of France. At the pres-
ent time he is an automobile salesman
in Anderson, S. C., “the old home town.”

ee J,

Two infallible signs of Spring are horse-
shoes and baseball. The first of these, be-
gun many days ago, is now on the wane and
the second is rapidly superseding it. Var-
sity, class, and bush-league are equally prom-
inent. But the Varsity is leaving this week
for a foreign invasion, and naturally the
field is left open for the class teams.

holding the long end of a 8 to 2 score.
Clemson was unable to overcome a lead
gained by the Red and Black nine in the
first four innings. In the eighth period
the Tigers rallied and shoved across one
run, but were never able to make the
tying counter.

Captain Pat Crawford started the ball
rolling for the Wildcats in the first in-
ning, when he slammed a long fly over the
centerfielder’s head and made a complete
circle of the bases. His home run was
the only hit for that inning.

Covington’s single in the second frame
was ineffective, his team-mates allowing

THE PASSING OF
BELL MAUZE.

With the exodus of the class of "93 |

there will pass from Davidson, a man
whose shadow has been as far-reaching
in its extent as that of any man in his
class. What other member of the class
of ’28 has attained the altitude of Bill
Mauze?

Yet not only in inches does Bill tower |
head and shoulders above the mere men
of his class, but as a man of the cam-

pus, as a student, and as a sport writer,
he has becdine prominent.

From the moment Bill hit. the campus,
a web-footed freshman, and was subject-

ed to the indignity of having to balance |
a fresh cap on his stately head, he has |

been whole heartedly in support of the
Davidsonian. During the year of his
freshmanship he was general utlity man,
doing anything, and doing it well. From

the start however, he showed a predilec- |

tion toward athletic reporting, and mani-
fested the greatest zeal and skill: when in-
structed to report fer the sporting col-
umns.
in acknowledgment of his ability as a re-
porter, he was elected to membership in
the Reporter’s Club.

During his sophomore year he busied
himself chiefly with writing up _ ball
games of the foot, basket, and base.
Scarce a varsity game could be played
without Bill’s presence as a reporter. The
grass along the sidelines were kept in
continual subjection, by reason of the
ever presence of Bill’s number elevens.

Embarking upon his Junior year, he
became the athletic editor’s right hand
man, and became recognized as one to be
relied upon, on every athletic occasion.
During this year he was awarded the
Golden Quill in recognition of his work,
from the standpoint of quality, as well
as of quantity. Later in the year he was
initiated into the Delta Pi Kappa jour-
nalistic fraternity. Not content with
these achievements of the pen, he slew yet
another giant, for after the Davidsonian
staff appointments for the following
year, Bill found himself Athletic Edi-
tor.

Under his enterprising hegemony this
year, the athletic department of the Da-
vidsonian has been unusually interesting
and full of sporting information and
dope. . The athletic writeups have been
exceptionally vigorous and up to date,
and though all games have not come out,
precisely as doped to come out, Bill has
certainly done as much toward winning
our victories as the average wearer of
the D.

One of the livest strands of the “livest
wire on the Hill” this year, has been the
column headed “Bill’s Bull.” Whether
this bull was on football, basketball, base-
ball, or track, it was ever entertaining
and enlightening and Bill’s own. Bill’s
line was unique.

field took care of the other two, however,
and the Tigers’ last chance was gone. It
was easy to set down three in quick suc-
cession in the last inning.

On the mound two southpaws opposed
euch other. The score card gives Sor-
rels the better record, for the Wildcat
hurler allowed only 4 hits, and kept them
scattered, while nine South Carolinians
whiffed the air in a vain attempt to find
Bascomb’s curves. “Lefty” Davis, another
left-hander, in spite of permitting eight
hits, pitched stellar ball in the pinches.
Only in the fourth inning did he weaken
and allow the decisive tallies.

Captain Pat Crawford stepped up into
his old hitting form by swatting the pill
for two good hits, one of them the clean
homer which got the jump on -Clemson.

A change in Davidson’s line-up was
necessary in this game on account of the
ruling against Freshmen. The Alford
brothers were thus jerked from their
regular posts at left field and short.
Mickey McKay filled Sion’s place well at
infield position, while Boushee was used
in the outfield.

WOFFORD GAME .

The Wildcat diamond squad invaded
the Palmetto state last week, opening
with the Wofford Terriers at Spartan-
burg on Wednesday in an _ exhibition
which proved to be a slugfest in favor
of the charges of Rip Major, by a tally
of 10 to 4. Both clubs hit the ald-apple
rather hard and often, with ‘Wofford
touching McLaughlin, Wildcat’ fresh
hurler, for fourteen safeties while the
Red and Black warriers faced a lucky
moundsman in the person of Harold
Murph, the Neally Hunter of Wofforddom
The little moundsman yielded eight hits
to the sticks of Richards, Crawford,
Brice, Covington, and Frank - Alford.
Other Wildcats were unable to solve his
hooks and curves.
