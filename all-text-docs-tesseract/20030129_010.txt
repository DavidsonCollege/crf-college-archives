Bernard’s 34 points pace

With the recent loss of senior captain Peter
Anderer, the Davidson basketball team has
been pressed with the burden of making up for
. his absence.

Losing Anderer’s 15.1 points per game and
31.4 minutes per game has not been easy to
overcome, especially for the backcourt, which
misses the shooting.guard’s play and leader-
ship perhaps most of all.

This past Saturday, against conference rival
UNC Greensboro, the team and the backcourt
did just that.

One might say, in fact, that the backcourt
really stepped it up on offense.

Or, perhaps, one might just concede that
senior co-captain and point guard Wayne Ber-
nard dominated the game for the Wildcats.

Bernard scored a career-high 34 points, 13
in the final ten minutes of the game, to lead the
*Cats to victory.

His impressive numbers include 9-15 from
the field, 4-8 from beyond the arc, 12-14 from
the line, and 7 assists in 38 minutes.

The Wildcats started off sloppy, missing
easy baskets and turning the ball over, but
UNCG was unable to capitalize.

The Spartans never led by more than three
points in the opening minutes, allowing the
*Cats to work out their kinks and pull things
together.

Davidson grabbed the lead at the turn of the
first half and held it until halftime.

The Spartans came out strong to start the
second. half, however, and they eventually
took the lead.

The game stayed close, and the Wildcats
worked their way back to a 50-50 tie with just
under ten minutes remaining in the game.

That’s when Bernard grabbed control of the
game.

He hit a lay-up to put the ’Cats up by two,
and after a jumper by freshman Ian Johnson
put Davidson ahead for good, went on to score

11 more points to seal the game, including two

clutch three pointers.

“T felt like I needed to step up and lead the
team,” Bernard commented. “A lot of times
teams don’t finish out games, and I knew that
was what we needed to do. We went out and
played good defense, which leads to good
offense.”

Johnson, who had a double double with 13
points and 10 rebounds, and freshman Brendan
Winters, who scored 11 points and grabbed 7
rebounds; assisted Bernard in his effort.

Bernard will remember this day for more
than just his excellent performance, as a three
point basket with 8:08 remaining in the first
half made him the 34th player in Davidson
history to reach 1,000 career points.

“I was happy, of course, and my parents
were ecstatic,” he said'about the feat, “but I’m
just looking forward to finishing out the sea-
son and winning the rest of our games.”

He added, “I could never have accomplished
any of this without the help and support of my
teammates.”

Bernard and his teammates look towards
the remainder of the season with high hopes.

“T don’t think we'll have another loss,”
Bernard predicts. “We-know how .good we
are, and we just need to go out and play the way
we’ re capable of playing.”

early, Matt McKillop unloading from three-
point range late. ,

That’s the formula the men’s basketball
team used in Monday night’s 80-71 win over
East Tennessee State, and the result was the
Wildcats’ best road win—actually, only their
second road win— of the season.

As the Southern Conference season nears
the halfway point, Davidson (11-6, 5-2) finds
itself in a tie with the Bucs (11-7, 5-2) for
second place in the North Division.

“We really needed this,” said McKillop
after the game. “With two more road games,
hopefully this will get us going.”

McKillop went wild from three-point range
in the second half, connecting on six treys to
keep the Wildcats ahead even when ETSU

mounted a late charge.

He tied his career-high with 24 points on 8-
of-13 shooting, including a career best with
those six treys.

Seniors Wayne Bernard and Michel
Lusakueno also scored in double-figures for
the ’Cats. Bernard netted 19 points while
Lusakueno scored 10 points.

Lusakueno shouldered much of the scoring
load in the first half, catching the ball down
low and maneuvering for several baskets.

“T said to him, ‘Michel, don’t look at the
bench. You’re staying in.’ And I thought he
gave us a big lift,” said coach McKillop.

After leading by as many as 12 points, the
Wildcats saw their lead melt to only four with
just over 10 minutes to play.

McKillop was key in halting every Buc run.
He put an end to the Wildcat six-minute scor-
ing drought with two straight trifectas, build-
ing the Davidson lead back to 10 points.
