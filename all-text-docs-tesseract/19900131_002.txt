Central-America trip not too dangerous;
plans continue for student visit

By ARMANDO SANCHEZ-ABALLI
A group of 15 students led by Religion
professor David Kaylor and Political
Science professor Brian Shaw will em-
bark for Guatemala on May 14 and
examine the interplay between religion
and politics in Central America.
Sponsored by the Dean Rusk pro-
gram, the travelling seminar will divide
a 16-day journey between Guatemala
and Nicaragua. The seminar’s ap-
proach is based on dialogue with the

residents - ranging from government
and military officials, to church leaders
and rural habitants. “By exposing the
students to a wide variety of views,”
said Shaw, “they can more objectively
assess the situation and the conflicts.”
The expedition is an extension of the
class Religion and Politics in Central
America, jointly taught by Kaylor and
Shaw. “The students will have first
hand exposure to the problems,” said
Kaylor, “and will gain insight through

this educational endeavor.”

The team will be escorted by “peace
associates” from the Presbyterian
Church who reside in the region and
serve as liaisons. The experience of
these escorts will guide the group away
from any perilous areas.

“This trip appears dangerous, almost
foolhardy,” said Shaw, “however, our
travels absolutely keep us only in areas
that pose no threat.”

Senior Doug Hicks was a participant

in the seminar group which traveled in
1988. “The personal interaction with the
residents was unforgettable,” said
Hicks “and I wish I could go again.”
Caroline Craig recalls her experiences,
“Bombarded by all the new sounds and
smells made me feel likea child again.”

Shaw summed up the feelings of the
previous trip, “It was emotionally
powerful, and probably one of the most
moving experiences in the students’
lives.”

“We plan to generate discus-

Tavernise also mentioned
that girls take the issue more
seriously than men. One of
the group’s goals is to bring
awareness to men about
what behavior is both legal
and responsible.

If this statistic holds true for
Davidson, then the question
remains why the victims fail to
report the crime.

“People don’t want to tal
about it,” said Tavernise. “It’s
probable that more have oc-
curred, but people only talk
about it to their hallmates and
best friends.”

Tavernise said that the ru-
mor that a total of 17 women
have been raped on campus
since September is “just ri-
diculous.” Such a rumor only
shortails the education prog-
ress because “it makes guys
think they won’t get caughtor

any decisions. The women
could make a criminal com-
plaint, take the case to the
Code of Responsibility or do
both.”

In addition, Marsicano
mentioned that in the past,
women have also chosen to
individually confront the
assailant.

come from Asia), and thus
people from Africa are Afri-
cans or African-Americans as
opposed to Negroes, blacks or
coloreds. There is no “Negro-
land”, “Blackland”, or “Col-
oredland”, but there is Africa.
“Kemet” is an African name
meaning “the black land” or
“the land of the black”;
“Egypt” is a Greek name
meaning “the black people.”
In Kemet can be found pyta-
mids and the Sphinx (“pyra-
mid” and “Sphinx” are also
Greek words). Among the
nine pyramids, there are the
tallest stones, and the oldest
and first buildings in the
world. Recent theories on the

pyramids suggest that they
were constructed as observa-

tories. Noone isburied inany -

of the pyramids, contrary to
popular opinion. The Sphinx,
at over 10,000 years old, is the
oldest sculpture on earth.
Like some 75 - 80 percent of all
the statues in Egypt, the
Sphinx is missing a nose and
lips. Some statues have been
totally decapitated.
Why? According to Brow-
der’s research, Napoleon, the
first conqueror of Egypt, or-

' dered his soldiers to blow off

the noses and lips of statues
with their canons.

' This action destroyed the
evidence of the statues’ identi-
ties as Africans, and hoped to

Panel of male
feminists speaks out

By GARY WHEELER

In a four-man panel in the
900 Room last Thursday en-
titled “Why I am a Feminist,”
one individual stated “I think
that I’m an activist in the way
that I live my life, I think that I
project feminist ideals, but I’m
not a member of the NOW
[National Organization of
Women].” These sentiments
were shared by Richard Terry,
Director of Residence Life.
Other panel members included
senior Doug Hicks, college
President John Kuykendall
and Eric Whytsell, Operations
Manager of the Union. The
event was an Open Forum.

All of the panelists agreed
that thereis some degree of risk
involved inadmitting that they
are feminists. Whytsell said

that the confining nature of the —

title feminist makes it risky.
“Labels are always restric-
tive - they never seem to be
agreed on by anyone,” he
stated. Whytsell considers
himself to be more of a human-
ist, “not in the heathen sense,”
he said, “but just that I like
people and I think people

nist,” he said. Another risk is
thatitis one of those words that
deserves some living up to, and
to label yourself that is to make
some commitments that you
ought to take on seriously.”

Hicks said that one of the
main problems of being a femi-
nist at Davidson comes from
some of the women them-
selves. “I have heard some
women here say ‘When I get
married I want tosubmit to my
husband, and I want to be put
up on a pedestal and I’m not
embarrassed to be feminine,’
implying that feminists are
weirdo, scum, over there some-
where.”

Both Whytsell and Terry ex-
plained that part of the stigma
associated with feminismis the
assumption that feminists
have certain specific ideas
about what women ought to be
doing. Whytsell explained that
he took a more general view of
the activist role. “I actively try
to treat women with respect,
the same respect that] give any
other person, and try tochange
the mind of some of the people
who don’t,” he said.
