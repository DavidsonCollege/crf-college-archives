Jones’ knee is not alone

By MICHAEL Kruse
Sports Editor

Sewanee, Tenn. - Sophomore
Wes Jones, who injured his knee
late in the Maryville win, probably
has an ACL tear and will likely
take a medical redshirt this season
if that’s the case. Jones said that
his doctor was “95 percent sure”
that there was a tear, but that he
would know for sure after another
appointment today.

Football Notebook

But Jones may now havecom-
pany on the sidelines. Senior co-
captain and defensive stalwart A.R.
Barrington went down in the sec-
ond half on punt coverage against
Sewanee and appears to have torn
his ACL too.

Moll runs wild

Sophomore tailback Lorenzo
Moll’s 25-carry, 134-yard perfor-
mance in the season opener placed
him ninth in the nation in Division
I-AA rushing. Moll, who recorded
77 yards on Saturday despite sit-

ting out the fourth quarter with a:

concussion, is on pace to post a
1,000-yard season.

Senior wide receiver Kirk’

Roberts, with 29 catches this sea-
son, would become the tenth player

in school history to catch 100
passes. Roberts, who made 34 and
35 catches in 1994 and 1995, re-
spectively, caught one ball against
Maryville and three on Saturday .

Senior co-captain John Cowan
started his 32nd game in a row on
Saturday. Barring injury this fall,
the ironman lineman will finish his
Wildcat career having started all

against Sewanee. 40 possible contests.

Male harriers place third at Callewhice

By AARON DUNHAM

The Davidson men’s cross
country team pulled in a respect-
able showing at this past weekend’s
Catamount Classic, finishing third
among three other Southern Con-
ference foes at Western Carolina
University.

The team showed great im-
provement, according to coach
Gary Andrew, from their first meet
two weeks ago when they placed

this season, the media bitches and
moans aboutanother freakin’ year,
another worthless team, another
trophy-less Fenway Park lobby.

When the Sox start 11-3 or
something like that, it’s not Wow-
these-Sox-are-good-and-they’ re-
going-all-the-way-forget-that-
Curse-of-the-Bambino-nonsense.

It’s There-they-go-again-get-
ting-up-our-hopes-and-dreams-
only-to-set-us-up-for-another-late-
season-crumble-as-they-squash-
everything-we’ ve-ever-lived-for.

If the Sox ever actually win
the Fall Classic, the papers are not
going to break the news for weeks
in fear of baseball’s figureheads
changing some fundamental rule
of the game and taking away the
title. .

So Panthers fans, I don’t care
if you beat the damn 49ers. You’re
still an expansion team. And you’ re
still not going’ to win the Super
Bowl.

So there. —

fifth in the Appalachain Meet in
Blowing Rock.

Appalachain State won the
dual meet outright, finishing ahead
of host Western Carolina.The
Wildcat harriers placed third, fol-
lowed by The Citadel.

For the second straight meet,
junior Josh Cookson led Davidson
finishing eighth. Freshman Will-
iam Isenhour finished fourteenth
in just his second collegiate race.
Other top finishers for the Wild-
cats were Rick Cratensburg (20th),

Pat Burchett (23rd), and team cap-
tain Dave Foss (26th).

Foss was pleased with the
team’s performance.

“It was a solid meet and a
definite learning experience,” Foss
said. “The (Western Carolina)
course is the Southern Conference
Championship course and we
wanted to race on it before the
championships.”

The Wildcats had four more
runners place among the top thirty
finishers.

There’s no place like home

Men's soccer coach Charlie Slagle has reason to worry about
Davidson’s road play. While the Wildcats are 5-0 at home, they aré just
1-3 when playing away from the Richardson Field confines. That lone
victory came against St. Mary’s (Calif.) ina game played in Las Vegas.

“The ability to play on the road is what separates the good from the-
not-so-good teams,” Slagle said. “We’ll see if this team can do it.”

Slagle has been pleased with the play of s« senior goalkeeper Matt
Hill. Hill, who played in the
shadow of Alex Deegan during

the first three years of his col-

Soccer

lege career, has played well in
his first full sea- son in the start-
ing slot.

“Matt has really progressed nicely,” Slagle said. “He is the leader
of a very solid defense.”

As expected, Robert Clarke and Phil Julien have emerged as the

team’s leading goal-scorers. They are currently tied for the lead with
four apiece.

When Kelly Ammann scored in the 62nd minute against the
College of Charleston on Sunday, it was the first goal by a non-
freshman player this season for the women's soccer team. Ginny Dye
leads the team in goals with three, Kelly Rennick has two, Amy
Balsinger one, and Angie Boyer one.
