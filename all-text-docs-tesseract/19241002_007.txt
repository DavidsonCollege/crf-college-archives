“Nasty” was one of the few if not the
only man to ever guide a wildcat foot-
ball squad for two consecutive years.
Surely he is the only man in the 160
pound class that ever did. He was as
his clasmates said, “Truly the embodi-
ment of the spirit of “Bob” Fetzer, His
power of leadership and foree of pep

and energy cannot be doubted when you |

consider that he not only played on, but
captained a team that had a man weigh-

ing 190 pounds playing fullback. He
weighed only 166 pounds and played
tackle. His main claim to fame rests

howeyer on his playing in the Clemson
game in 1015 when he recovered a fum-
ble that won the game. The “Charlotte
Observer” of that date says, “Captain
Howell was on the bottom with the pig-
skin safely in his possession. It was
the turning point of the game.” The
coaches of that year were: “Bob” and
“Bill Fetzer. and Nelson Harris. Lex
Nlutz, who lectured here last year, was
manager.

Dr. Arbuckle Speaks
To Ministerial Band

The Church Was Topic of Elaborate
Address to Ministerial Students

In addressing the Ministerial Band at
regular meeting last Sunday after-
Dr. HH. Be Arbuekle spoke on The
Church, He brought out the fact that the
Church was mentioned only twice in the
Bible. and these two passages
referring to the Chureh, Matthew
20, and Matthew i8s15-17. He explained
that Christ did not found His Chureh on

its

noon,

he read

1O213-

Peter, “Thou art the Christ, the Son of

the Living God.” The attitude of the
Church must be militant, as Christ in-
timated that it would be so when He

said the gates of Hell should not prevail
Against it.

From the seeond passage he drew the |
that humility is one of the
Christian assets,

privately as man man rather than

listen, others should go to him. If they
