Project Life adds
298 names to registry

Over 300 people entered the
Morrison Room on Wednesday
willing to be poked and prodded in
support of the National Bone Mar-
row Registry.

Davidson’s sixth annual
Project Life typed 298 students to
be added to the national registry.

Organizer Sarah Lindsay said
of the turnout, “This is such an
important cause, and I’m so happy
so many people have supported it.
This is something Davidson should
be really proud of.”

According to Lindsay, Project
Life raised the necessary funds to
pay foreach student who was typed.
Each test costs around $60.

Project Life raised the money
by selling Project Life t-shirts, a

letter campaign, a raffle, and
through the support of Patterson
Court houses.:

Letters were written to alumni,
friends of Davidson, and people
whom organizers believed would
be sympathetic to the cause.

Raffle tickets were also sold
for $2 apiece, with the top two
prizes being a hot air balloon ride
and two sets of two tickets to a
Carolina Panthers game.

Associate Professor of French
Dr. Carole Kruger won the hot air
balloon ride, and students Jackie
Rasulo and Lexie Beermann won
the tickets.

After six years, Project Life
has added over 2,000 names to the
national database of potential do-
nors.

Five Davidson students have
already donated bone marrow.
