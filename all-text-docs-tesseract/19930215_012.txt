Who Died and Left You the Judge?

by Marilyn Ambroise

Too often I hear people who
refer to themselves as “good Chris-
tians” pass judgment on others.
They sit back in their high chairs,
day after day, pointing fingers at
people. These “good Christians”
worship the Lord for one day—if
not less than that (technically)—
and for the rest of the days of the
week, they worship the devil. Their
criticisms are usually based on ig-
norance and misunderstanding.
The issue of homosexuality is a
perfect illustration of this fact.

Nothing fascinates me more
than the ability of some “good
Christians” to claim to love God
and resent homosexuals in one
breath. It is one thing to hear
someone who I know is an atheist
speak against homosexuality, be-
cause I know that they are not
obliged to live by a book that speaks
against all forms of hatred, But as
for those who do claim to serve
God, I am repulsed by their atti-
tudes toward homosexuals. For
the holy Bible focuses on love and
not hate. :

Even more amazing though,
is the way in which some “good
Christians” try to justify their feel-
ings for homosexuals. They use
the Bible, or better yet, they ma-
nipulate the Bible to perpetuate
this form of hate. One example of
this is the frequently used Scrip-
ture in the book of Romans, which
reads, “For this cause God gave
* them up unto vile affections; for
even their women did change the
natural usc into that which is against
nature. And likewise also the men,
Icaving the natural use of the
woman, burning in their lust to-
wards other men, with men work-
ing that which is unseemly, and
receiving in themselves that rec-
ompense of their error which was
meet.” :

Notice that homosexuality is
never mentioned. In addition, it is
important that we keep in mind
that the Bible has been translated
or, better yet, tampered with. There
have becn occasions when Scrip-
tures were twisted to support the
works of the devil.

Do youremember the times of
slavery? Although I did not expe-

killed blacks (and thought it was
permissable to own another per-
son), but the white race as a whole
can’t be held guilty today for what
our individual ancestors did then.
We as a country must learn from
our mistakes but not continually
beat ourselves in the face about
them.
Deidra: As far as I’m concerned,
slavery will always be a relevant
issue when concerning racism in
the present, because people have
Not gotten to the point where they
are able to look atall fellow menas
equals. I do feel that the racist
attitudes of whites are a result of
the actions that occurred during
slavery. The ancestors of these
whites were the ones who owned
slaves. Not only did they own

rience the life of a slave, I can
never forget what my African-
American ancestors suffered
through. Itis horrifying to think of
the way they were auctioned off
like pieces of merchandise, the way
women slaves were raped by the
slave owners, and the way they
were brutally beaten and murdered.

At the same time, I will not
forget thatmany “good Christians”
tried to justify their devilish acts
by using the Bible. It was some
“good Christians” that said that
slavery was condoned in the Bible.

Currently, the same thing is
happening with the issue of homo-
sexuality. You-see, it may be a
different year, and the victims may
be a different group, but the same
type of individuals are guilty of
perpetuating hate by the same
means,

I empathize with homosexu-
als because, although I was nevera
slave, I know what it is like to be
discriminated against for some-
thing that I have no contol over. I
cannot change my skin color and
even if I could, I would not. Simi-
larly, homosexuals have expressed
that they cannotchange their sexu-
ality. They don’t just wake up and
decide to be gay, just like I did not
wake up and decide to be African-
American.

Why doso many “good Chris-
lians” resent homosexuals? Prob-
ably for the same reason that many
ofthem resent African-Amcricans.
The problem is that you fear who
you dare not know. The mind is
fascinating. Its ability to drive us
to hallucinate or make-up things is
overwhelming.

There is no reason to fear ho-
moscxuals, They are terrific people
justlike you and me. More impor-
tantly, they are God’s children—
just like you and me. And as the
children of any sct of parents, it is
vital that we get along, no matter
what our differences.

There is no reason why homo-
sexuals should not be allowed in
churches and there is no reason
they should notbe allowed to serve
in the military. These things touch
me because I am again reminded
of what my African-American an-
cestors went through.

They could not go to school

because of the color of their skin,
they could not frequent certain

places because of the color of their
skin, and even after the Civil War,
certain restrictions remained on
them because of the color of their
skin. And now homosexuals are
being forbidden to docentain things
because of their sexual orienta-
tion. Is this truly the work of God?
In other words, is this what God is
calling us to do? I really don’t
think so.

I think that God is calling us to
love. The Bible contains Scrip-
tures that illustrate this very clearly.
It is not implicd nor is it left up to
interpretation when the Bible says,
“Thou shalt /ove the Lord thy God
with all thy heart, and with all thy
soul, and with all thy strength, and
with all thy mind; and thy neighbor
as thyself’ or “Owe no man any
thing, but to Jove one another: for
he that /oveth another hath ful-
filled the law.”

lam a Christian and my duty
as a Christian is to follow Christ.
Christ did not discriminate, he
loved. He did not only love those
who, for society, came easy to love,
but he also loved those that were
put aside by society. If you con-
sider yourself a “good Christian,”
follow Christ. Do not sit on your
high chair judging others, for even
Christ did not spend his days with
this worthless occupation. Instead,
occupy your heart with love and
occupy your time giving love to
others. No, the issue is not whether
or not I condemn homosexuality.
The issue is that homosexuals are
part of this world. They are here to
Stay, justas African-Americansare.
Whether you like it or not, they are
God’schildren, they are your broth-

ers and sisters. Therefore, you
must love them, if you call your-
self a “good Christian.”

In closing, I believe that if
Christ was present today in the
flesh, he would embrace homo-
sexuals and treat them with love
and kindness. I don’t think that he
would judge them and therefore
neither should you. For no one
died and anointed you judge!

Actions Defined Prejudices

them, but they subjected them to
beatings, harsh living conditions,
almost impossible labor, and psy-
chological torture. It is the actions
and mentality of these ancestors
that caused the attitudes of hatred
and prejudice to be passed from
generation to generation to the
present.

As long as there are people
who think that black people are
inferior and don’t have the mental
capacity to function without the
aid of others, slavery needs to be a
hot topic at hand, because people
still believe the racist attitudes that
emerged from slavery. In order for
me to continue living as an Afri-
can-American in this country, I
need to be reminded constantly of
slavery so that I remember that
everyone in this world is noton my
side. In fact, there are some people
who are waiting to see me fail,
because I am an African-Ameri-

can, and they think that I am not
able to succeed by my own abili-
ties and intelligence.

The question could be asked,
“Is the constant reminder of sla-
very damaging to black people’s
self-esteem; will they subcon-
sciously have an inferiority com-
plex because of the attitudes of.
slavery?” No, if anything, slavery
is a reminder of the strength and
courage that my ancestors exhib-
ited when faced with such harsh
conditions. It shows the strength
that can emerge from what seems
like animpossible situation. I think
blacks and whites should be able to
discuss the issues of slavery and
lear from the actions of those
times. This, however, is not hap-
pening to the extent that it should.
Thus, slavery remains a relevant
issue.

their children, pointing to the stu-
dents and saying, “whatever you
choosé¢ to do with your life, for the
sake of our family, never act like
those buffoons!”

One of these raucous individu-
als might argue, "If Bob McKillop
can contest calls, so can I." Where
this person errs is that coaches

-argue mostly so the next calls will

go their way, while these individu-
als argue presumably because their
maturity level is not yeton par with
Homer Simpson. |

Letmestate for the record that
I am very much for fan participa-
tion during athletic events. I don’t
condemn booing nor am I against
the occasional “‘Airball” chant. I
am a varsity athlete (baseball) here
at Davidson and wish every stu-
dent on campus would come to our
games and cheer. What irks me is
the mindless abuse of another hu-
man being who is doing the best he
can. I would much rather you stay
in your dorm room and do what-
ever it is you do behind closed
doors, than come out and support
us if Wednesday was any indica-
tion of normal behavior.

To give you a better idea of
what it was like to sit near these
individuals, watch America’s Fun-
niest Home Videos with Bob Saget.

Every time Bob introduces a video
with an extremely unfunny ancc-
dote, you feel yourself cringe with
embarrassment for him. This fecl-
ing of embarrassment was what it
was like for me and other fellow
students who are admittedly mor-
tified to attend the same institution
of higher learning as they are.
Why I didn’t just get up and find
another seat in Belk Arena? The
answer is simple. Soon after wit-
nessing this idiocy, I decided to
use The Davidsonian as a forum
for my disgust, and I wanted to
experience the whole game as a
visiting, unexpecting fan might
have to do. These people, who are
enrolled in the same school as I
(the word "classmates" might in-
sinuate a closeness which I by no
means wish to convey), are a
shameful partofthe Davidson com-
munity. I think if James Naismith
(the inventor of basketball) could
have foreseen the moronic behav-
ior displayed by the students, he
never would have bothered to hang
the peach baskets. I would never
have been one to cast aspersions
onanother person, butitis necesary
to let these people know what oth-
ers think of them. These fans are
anembarrassment. Do everyone a
favor, take a hint! Either grow up
or watch the game lateronD.C.T.V.

I remember when I was at
Arlington National Cemetery, and
foundamidstall those similar white
markers, a slightly larger brown
one. It turned out to be the grave-
stone of boxer Joe Louis, “the
Brown Bomber,” who fought ex-
hibitions all over the world as a
soldier in the still-segregated U.S.
Army of World War II. I vividly
remember the touching brass-re-
lief on the stone of him in a boxing
stance. Iremember my father tell-

ing me that Louis used to be intro-
duced in the ring as “a credit to his
race,” and how upon his death a
sportswriter had written that he
was indeed a “credit to his race,”
but added “the human race.”> It
was truly fitting tribute.

People like Louis and Ashe
were outstanding athletes, solid
citizens, and terrific men. Their
stories are inspiring to everyone,
black or white. When we remem-
ber such people and their accom-
plishments, let’s celebrate them not
because they were black or white
but because they were great.

Or maybe it is. But I liked it
better the other way. It was sim-
pler then, and honest.

“But children are so imma-
ture,” you say, “so inexperienced
that what they feel cannot be called
love.”

Bah!

In love we are all giggling
children. But we feel obligated to

play adults, to be calm and col-
lected, to rationalize and under-
stand our emotions. In our experi-
ence and wisdom, we pervert love,
orkillitdead. Ihave abag of candy
hearts in front of me right now.
“Be mine,” “Be true,” “I ‘heart’ U,”
they say. Nothing ambiguous there.
Donnaand I? We held sweaty
hands and had palpity hearts for
three and a half weeks. Then she
went her way; I went mine. C’est
l'amour.

“woman,” containing male pro-
nouns. Whatdifference does some-
thing as insignificantas thatmake?
Itall lies inempowerment. Males’
behavior is reinforced by a male-
dominated society in which gen-
der determines what roles one will
play from birth. Pretty much any-
thing we, as men, want to getaway

with, wecan, We've gotthe whole

culture backing us up.

Soit would seem that we, with
all of our civility still live by the
premise that might is right. Guys,
let’s try real civility. Try equality.
Try respect. Try to consider her
point of view before you give that
high five of conquest.

* And ifnone of this meansany-
thing to you, consider that men,
too, are forced into gender roles by

our society. Look at John Wayne,
The Marlboro Man, John'Claude
Van Damme. They’re tough, have
hearts of iron, never shed a tear,
live forthe conquest. These are the
ultimate men, the standards to
which menaretoaspire. It’shardly
any wonder men treat women with
such a lack of respect. How can
anyone portray such charactcris-
tics and still be civil?

But don’t take that as an ex-
cuse or explanation. Take it as an
affront to your humanity, men.
Equality is a dream that will never
be realized, but it’s certainly a bet-
ter ideal to strive for than the
Marlboro Man. At least equality is
still breathing. The Marlboro
Man’s dead and I can’t even re-
member his name.

Sincerely,
Jack Livings '96
