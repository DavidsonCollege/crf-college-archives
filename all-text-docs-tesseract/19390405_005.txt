LAST CHANGE IN _ 1837

Society Plans Hay Ride and
Supper With Queens
Spectators Club

A new constitution, drafted
by a committee headed by M.
M. Pleasants, was presented
for approval to the Philan-
thropic Literary Society at its
regular meeting last night in|
the Phi hall, |

The reason for the drafting of
this new constitution was that the
old one was not up to date as it |
was drafted when the society was |
first founded. The new constitu- |
tion was considerably shortened and
various other changes were made

in it. This has been the first re-
on the constitution
since the society's founding in 1837. |

vision made

Plans are being made for a social
to be held with the Spectators’ club |
of Queens College in the very near
future. The plans are to include a
hay ride in a truck to the Red}
Fez club of Charlotte where supper |
will be A stunt program
given jointly by the Phi Society and |
the Spectators’ club will follow the |
supper. Thirty-five girls are to be)

invited with a corresponding num- |

served.

ber of men. |

Another important item of busi- |
ness was discussed: the possibilities |
for the continuing of the debates |

between the Phi and the Eu soc-
ieties.

The meeting was then turned
over to the program committee.
Sid Sample led the devotions ; |

Boyd Flynn gave a short Anti-War

talk; and Russell Smith gave a
talk on Edgar Allan Poe.
