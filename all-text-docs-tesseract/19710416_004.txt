Spirit Of (Concern?

Now that the Code of Responsibility and Punish-
ment, and with it the entire system of campus gov-
enance at Davidson, is publicly on the firing line be-
fore the Committee on Campus Governance, two ques-
.tions naturally arise: What new plans for campus
geverance and authority will the committee recom-
vend to the trustees? Will students in actual practice
be given any influencial and determinative voice in
the tinal decision? by

Ironically, the second question is more important
than the first, for the interest in student opinion and
the openness to ideas of student government demon-
strated by the committee prior to its final proposals
will be indicative of the spirit of the committee’s. con-
clusions.

In light of this, certain policies being followed
by the committee in its discussions and considerations
seem most distressing. it appears that once again the
student at Davidson is being given the shortest end
of the stick.

Only one student, the President of the Student
Government Association, sits on the committee. Per-
haps we should appreciate this one token vote. It
seems to us, however, that this tokenism represents
the type attitude that the committee should be work-
ing to eliminate from the campus.

Furthermore, only select members of the stu-

deat body (the Student Senate, Senate Executive Com- -

mittee, and a very few others) have been granted the
privilege of discussing their views on campus govern-
ance with the committee. Mass meetings are nol prac-

tical or worthwhile, but, a request for more honest.

*$mmunication and less secrecy does not seem to be
asking too much of the committee.

In short, the governance committee has not yet
displayed:any new spirit of concern and responsibili-
ty to students that it necessarily should in its consid-
crations of the campus power structure. This is un-
fortunate, for it is the student who, in the end, is
going to have to live with and be subjected -to the
new college governance system.

Money And Community

The question of finances may be reduced to a
matter of semantics. The Davidson which — students
like to talk about is the institution of the moment—
the faculty, buildings and administrators. with which
they have immediate contact during their four years.

The administration looks to the continuing David-
son—looking at the financial problems from the per
spective next year, five years from now or 25 years
from now.

The administration has shown confidence in its
ability to meet the ‘long range needs of the college
at the open meeting on Monday. They were talking

in terms of the Davidson of continuing college com-*

munity fame.

At the same time the students are looking at the
Davidson of the moment and the financial picture
which we can see is not nearly as bright—increases in:
tuition, room, board and fees; the possibility of fewer
meals on the college board, plan; reduced services at
the laundry and decreases in financial aid.

In the student’s definition of Davidson-he can
only see himself as a handy device for balancing the
budget. It is the student who has paid the cos‘s of
inflation with annual increases in costs. Wilh the in-
creases the college has been able to stay even: the
expected “tightening of belts” is still a promise as
far as students can see. The continuing staff has
ss ca itself and has in fact grown and multi-
plied.

_ There is a very real need for a functional rela-
tionship between the administration, faculty and stu-
dent over the issues of the budget. It is fair for the
administration to balance the budget. It is fair for
the faculty to ask why the inflationary spiral has not
hit their salaries yet. It is fair for the students to ask
to see tangible results from their money or have a
voice in deciding how it will be used for the future.

President Spencer seems to be responsive to the
idea of student participation on the committee which
handles ‘the financial affairs of the institution. This
seems to be'a very profitable direction in which the
college can move. To demand that the students pay
and not ask why is ridiculous. It is only through par-
ticipation in the affairs of the college that the stu-
dent body may become part of the community and
bring the two “Davidsons” closer together.

Campuses Become Grim
As Students Lack Humor

Something there is about
napalm which tends to ob-
secure the brighter side of
life. And the same might be
said of urban blight, pollu-
tion, the ever increasing
probability that one cannot
escape severe mauling at the
hands of those less fortunate
than oneself, acneand other
bedevilments too numerous
to be mentioned. |

Yet, if all this were not
enough to drive the most
well-adjusted of. men up the
wall, the whole mess is made
that much worse by the atti-
tude with which we, the ‘‘stu-
dent generation" in particu-
lar, face it.

We are a grim group. As
portrayed in any of the pop-
ular media, the student is
not serious, he is downright
hostile toward the world in

‘ which he lives. Try to think

of a magazine cover or*tear-
gas melodrama in which any
of the student generation is
shown smiling. None to be
found.

Having had the great good
fortune to be included at sev-
eral meetings in which the
ways of the college are ex-
plained to the senior mem-
bers of the continuing com-
munity, it has been my lot
to watch the student leaders
of -this school present this
same image.

"They are good men, filled
with seriousness of: purpose,
but not an ounce of humor

, in any of them. The meet-

ings have been dry, to say
the least.

Political activism is now

the preeminent dispenser of
grimpess on campus, the de-
sir€ to save the world from
the ravages of.war and in-
dustrial technology supplant-
ing whatever good humor
may lie behind the furrowed
brows of the concerned stu-
dent. What laughter eminates
from this quarter is tinged
with bitterness.
4. This is not to suggest that
we adopt an attitude of
sweetness and light and deny
the existence of the outside
world and its problems. The
Good Ship Lollipop is in dry-
dock,-unable to stay afloat in
today's troubled waters. Like
it or not, we have to face
the devastating problems
which confront us.

In. spite of the depressing
nature of the _macrocosm,
however, there
the microcosm to feed the
ready wit. If the world situa-
tion is bleaker than ever be-
fore human nature remains
the same: filled with flaws
and prone to error.

The posturing of our would-
be saviors, the triteness of
our rhetoric, the foibles
which plague each of us; all
of this’ is the stuff upon
which the comic spirit can
play. This spirit ought to be
released, for through it alone
can sanity be maintained in
an insane world.

As far as actual experience
can reveal, man is a dif-

is much in,

_
‘

ficult creature to perfect.

Until the dread day when
the psychologists find a way
to make him ‘‘better,” It is a
pretty safe bet that Utopia
will elude us.

This being the case, the
best thing to be done is to
learn to live with ourselves,
warts and all, and to love
each other for what we are.
From the return of laughter
we may well attain the self-
understanding which will en-

DICK ANDERSON

able us to cope with our sit-
uation more effectively.

It is by now a common-
place that style is an impor-
tant, perhaps the important,
factor in our polities. T his
being the case, we ought to
remove grimness from the
list of virtues, for it leads to
a style which is dry, stale
and, in the final analysis,
dispairing.

Come, let us refresh our-
selves with a-daugh.

Discussion Has

Useful Results

Monday College President
Samuel R.. Spencer Jr. and
several of his staff held a
meeting with students to
discuss finances. —

About 20 students were pre-

sent, seven from the news-
paper, several ffm student
government and a’few others.

I wandered into the Baxter
Davidson Room on _ second
floor in ‘Chambers from

playing basketball, unshow-

ered and. wearing my
basketball clothes. After I
left they would have had to
Spray ‘the room with. air
freshener to remove the
stink, but it had already
been burned away in the
flaming.

Actually the meeting did
have some useful results.
President Spencer promised
fo put student members on
the committee responsible
for financial matters as soon
as SGA President Danny
Clodfelter gets around to
appointing some.

C. David Cornell, Vice-
President of Financial Plans
ning and
tactfully suggested I would
make a good trustee.

(However, Clodfelter says
he won’t support me for a
post next year, so I may
have to pags that one up.

More to the point of the
meeting Cornell defended
his own salary and those of
his projected assistants as
paying for themselves many
times over in new funds for
the college.

The other Vice President
(for Academic Affairs) John
M. Bevan explained that
Davidson is trying to develop
a strong funding program. by
hiring Cornell and his as-
sistants.

Bevan used as an example
the fact that an overwhelm-
ing majority of all federal
aid to higher education goes
to about twenty institutions
(Harvard, MIT, Berkeley,
etc.). He said one’ of the
tasks of the development
personnel would be keeping
track of financial opportun-

itles in Washington for
Davidson.
However, the _ greatest

amount of federal aid is in

Development, °

the form of research grants,
mostly in the hard sciences.
And Davidson cannot hope
to share in those. As a mat-
ter of fact, I do not believe
Davidson should “even’ want
to.

Another major area of
funding for colleges is in the
area of fellowships such as
NSF, NDFL and NDEA.

But practically all of these
are graduate fellowships.

On the other hand, _ if
Davidson’s South Asia pro-
gram ever develops to _ in-
clude language training in,
for instance, Urdu-Hindi, the
college might pick up some
money to support students
and faculty in that area.

Spencer and Bevan dealt
to some extent with the
college's priorities in the way
of the belt-tighténing they
say the college must under-
go.

The place they are most
ready to look in for more
money is of course student
tuition increases. And ac-
cording to Bevan, the last
place the college is willing
to. cut away at is in the
faculty.

As my father is a profes-

sor, | have some appreciation

for the salary increases’ and
willingness to carry ‘fat’ in
terms of unproductive fa-
culty members which char-
acterized higher educational

‘institutions during the easy

times ‘of the last two dec-

ades.

In general the environment
was more pleasant for
everyone concerned when no
members of the college com-
munity had to worry about
keeping their place in it (ex-
cepting the rare student who
might flunk out)

But now that all colleges
are fish in a receding fin-
ancial sea, whether David-
son can continue to carry
overstaffed departments is
questionable.

Bevan says the process of
removing tenured faculty is
difficult and unpleasant, but
in other fields the college is
making such decisions, and
they cannot forever raise
tultion, no matter how re-
latively cheap the college is
now.
