The Question Box

The Reel Stuff

Dear Uncle Bud,

I am afraid that my papa will be shocked
when he gets my review grades. What can
I do? Tom Baker.
Dear Brassie,

You should have wired him.

Uncle Bud.

Dear Uncle. Buddie,

How would you personify Faith, Hope,
and Charity? P. Martin.
Dear Piggy,

Faith—Watt McCain when he believed it
all when his girl called him up and said that
she was sick and that she couldn’t come. He
sent a box of flowers, too.

Hope—Okey Allison; he still believes that
he'll get a girl.

Charity—Bill Murray; when in Charlotte,
he suggested that he and his girl go home
on the street car, Your Unk.
Dear Question Box,

I'm going to learn how to be a good
musician and compose popular songs like
Watt McCain. I have a good start as I can
play the bass drum by myself now. What
songs would you suggest that I play in my
orchestra ? Yours very truly,

David Woodrow Wilson.
Dear Boy,
I should suggest that you play some of the

latest hits, such as “Oils Well That Ends |

Well,” by Dough-heny, or “Those Balloon
Tires Have Us Up In the Air.” If these
are too modernistic you might recourse to
the old ballad entitled “Slap on the Paint,”
by Sherwin Williams. 3

Dear Uncle Bud,
‘IT am now taking medicine: do you think
that it a good course?
J. H. (Cash) Register.
Dear Hard Cash,
Yes. Hope you get well.

The Old Man.

Dear Uncle Bud,

For a long time I haven't been able to get
me a girl and as a result, I am kinda timid
around the Shebas. Don't you think that I
need to get some kind of a nice sweet girl
who will let me have my own way ?

Samuel Summers.
Dear Sam,

What you need is to hook up with one of
these nice responsible matrimonial bureaus
out west. They will send you all kinds of
literature and you can pick out a nice widow
with two or three children, who has several
thousand dollars and needs a nice trusting
support to spend it for her. Half a loaf is
better than no bread.

The attraction for this
“The Eternal City,” with Barbara La Marr,
Lionel Barrymore, Bert Lytell, Montagu
Love and Richard Bennett. The picture is
presented by Samuel Goldwyn and is pro-
duced by First National. The above is truly
an all-star cast and the director is George
Fitzmaurice, who was for some years one of
the successful for the
Famous Playets Lasky Corporation.

“The Eternal City” is an adaptation of the
novel by Sir Hall Caine of the same name.
It received unanimous praise from the New
York newspaper reviewers on its opening at
the Strand Theatre. The enthusiasm of the
critics apparently knew no bounds in their
praising of the rich beauty of the scenes
and the masterful handling of the theme.
This picture surpasses anything that
ever been produced with Rome as its locale.

he is overwhelmed by “the grandure that

As to the theme of the “Eternal City,” it
is sufficient to say that it is an adaptation
of the novel by Hall Caine. For those who

SOME CHANGE NECESSARY
' IN CHRISTIAN RELIGION

The Ministerial Band met last Sunday
afternoon with a large crowd in spite
of the inclemency of the weather and the
absence of many members in Charlotte.
The president of the band, J. L. McLean,
took charge of the meeting and intro-
duced Dr. Robert. F. Fitch wlio addressed
the band. Dr. Fitch spoke of the difficul-
ties and conditions that the minister
would meet in his work at the present-
cay situation. “The Christian Religion,”
he said, “is being questioned more today
than ever before and some change will
take place before long either for good or
for evil.”

He then took up the conditions and
problems that would confront the min:
ister in China. He said that a mission-
ary must understand China before he
can be of any good to the souls of that
reople. He explained the different reli-
gions of China and stated that although
most of the religions there are of great
harm to the people that some had been
of benefit. He cited instances where
heathen religions have done much for
the home life of the Chinese.
Chinese ..are. laya!-to their religion and
he advised that missionaries start the

Mr. Somerville, Davidson
Alumnus, to Address oy”

Is Pastor of Presbyterian Church of
Hillsville, Va.

Rev. Walter G. Somerville, of Hillsville,
Va., a former Davidson student, will speak
at the “Y” service next Sunday night.

Mr. Somerville is in charge of Home Mis-
sion work in Hillsville and in the surround-
ing country. His remarkable success there
seems all the more unusual as several years
ago that town was the scene of a great deal
of trouble. Due to his excellent work there
several larger churches and communities
have made him better offers but he has re-
fused to accept them. Mr. J. F. Johnston,
one of the prominent laymen of the South-
ern Church, who was originally from Hills-
ville, and who knew the need of a worker
there, was responsible for his going to that
town.

While Mr. Somerville was in Davidson he
was, in addition to being president of the
Y. My C. A., one of the most popular men
on the hill, At the beginning of the war he
enlisted as a private, but at the close of
the war he was a major. As he still
young, this was a remarkable achievement.

is

He may also be remembered by some of the
older men on the hill as being here with
James Fowle several years ago to conduct
the "Y" meeting, which was a great success.
Mr. Somerville will arrive in Davidson on
Thursday or Friday and will stay! with Mr,
Williams. He will be glad to talk with any
one interested in mission work at any time
during his stay here. He understands Da-
vidson problems and men and will also be
glad to talk with any men on any special
problems they may have to bring to him.
