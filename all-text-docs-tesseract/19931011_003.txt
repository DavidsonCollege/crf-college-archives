Carolina colleges adopt unlimited dorm visitation policies

This fall University of North Carolina
at Chapel Hill voted on an unrestricted
visitation policy; Davidson has not
had restrictions in years.

By Meg Wolff
Moving from a policy of re-
stricted visitation hours, the Uni-
versity of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill recently changed their policy
to give students more freedom. A
24 hour visitation policy was ap-

proved by the university.
Experiencing problems with
co-habitation, Chapel Hill’s policy
defines a guest as “any individual
that resides temporarily in a resi-
dence hall room or visits a student
room or public area at the invita-
tion ofan assigned room resident.”
The revised policy limits the
guest’s stay to 72 hours. An “ex-
cessive or too frequent pattern of

visitation” by the guest can result
in disciplinary action.

At the beginning of the fall
semester, visitation hours were set
from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m., Sunday
through Thursday, and 9 p.m. to 2
a.m. on Friday and Saturday.

After two weeks, students
were asked to choose between three
basic options: maintaining the set
visitation hours, having limited
guest visitation of 9 p.m.to1a.m.,
Sunday through Thursday and 24
hours on weekends, or 24 hour
visitation. The 24 hour visitation
option depends on negotiations
between roommates. Students also
have the option to “strengthen these

regulations and set visitation
hours.” Any option requires 2/3
vote of the residents of the hall to
pass. Chapel Hill’s new visitation
policy is a break from tradition;
however, it is not unique. Other
colleges and universities in North
and South Carolina have changed
their policies in accordance with a
changing age.

UNC Charlotte has had basi-
cally the same policy as Carolina’s
in effect since 1979. A minor
difference is that UNCC’s options
require 75% of the students in an
area to vote, and then 75% of the
voting number to pass an option
for that area, UNCC also has an
option for a minority of students
that want restricted visitation, of-
fering 1-2 hours of visitation daily.

Appalachian lets students
choose restricted visitation, until
12 a.m. on weeknights and 2 a.m.
on weekends, or a 24/7 option.

Scott Ranger in Residence
Life at ASU says the program's

appeal is to the “Christian element
of the alumni and parents."

Clemson University in South
Carolina sets visitation hours as 10
a.m. to 2 a.m. each day until a
referendum is called by 10% of the
residents in each area. The visita-
tion hours may then be decreased
or eliminated by a majority vote of
the residents. Clemson reserves
the right to “alter or terminate the
visitation program if the program
is determined by the administra-
tion not to be in the best interest of
the university.”

At UNCC the administration
will also step in if there is a prob-
lem. Jackie Simpson at UNCC
says, “If there is a problem they
cannot resolve as a group, then we
end visitation for them all. Visita-
tion is a privilege, not a right.”

Of course, Davidson’s policy
is an open 24/7 policy. But in the
Davidson policy, the rights of the
roommate are paramount, and a
roommate has the right to refuse

entrance to anyone except for the
other person assigned to the room.

Other schools also empower
the roommate, including UNCC’s
policy which says that the room-
mate takes precedence over the
visitation policy. Chapel Hill’s
new policy also forbids “coercing
a roommate into relinquishing
rights to privacy, sleep, or study in
order for a host to entertain a guest
will not be very tolerated at any
time, and will result in disciplinary
actions.”

Whether Chapel Hill’s new
policy succeeds in preventing co-
habitation remains to be seen, as
there is amixed student reaction to
the change in policy. Many stu-
dents are excited about the new
options, but also think that the ad-
ministration still has too much con-
trol over activities in the hall.

Meanwhile, similar policies
co-exist peacefully with students
and administration at local col-
leges and universities.

Baker sauna
not in use

Although Baker Sports
Complex provides many useful
services, one particular room in
the building lies barren and use-
less.

Asauna, built at the request
of the football department, has
never been used.

Ron M: Director..of.

ics, cites the problem: “It’s a
safety hazard. You could turn it
up to 500 degrees and no one
would find your body.”

The facility stands waiting
to be used, but it will not be any
time in the near future, according
to Morrow.

Currently, Baker cannot af-
ford to pay someone to monitor
the sauna.

Morrow says eventually the
sauna facility will be removed
andturned into office space once
“we get around to it.”

Accelerated Learning Program to enhance students' abilities

Study continued from page 1

fessor Wanda Webb anda member
of the counseling center in Cham-
bers 125 on Monday, November 8.

“Documentation Not Plagia-
rism - How to incorporate second-
ary resources effectively and
smoothly” will be taught by En-
glish Professor Shireen Carroll in
Chambers 125 on Monday, No-

hb. 15.

Whether or not students are
familiar with the topics offered,
they are encouraged to come to
any or all of the four classes on a
walk-in basis.

According to Carroll, the ac-
celerated learning sessions are de-
signed for “students of all classes,
freshmen to seniors, looking for
ways to make a good education at
Davidson even better and person-
ally more profitable.”

Upperclassmen are encour-
aged to attend to learn a few new
ideas, even though they may al-
ready be proficient in the skill, for
they may pick up a few pointers

they overlooked.

Freshmen who were exposed
to English Composition classes
may feel that some of the classes
such as the “Library Tips” session
will be redundant, yet the staff is
confident that the freshmen will
still learn something new.

Sessions similar to these were
held last spring. The sessions were
informative; however, attendance

was poor. These sessions have
been continued due to the demand
for a program like this by students,
the counseling center, and the Dean
of Students' office.

This Accelerated Learning
Program will also be offered in the
spring with different classes taught
by different Davidson professors.

The classes have been com-
pared to similar courses held at

other institutions by last year’s
coordinator ofthe program, Carroll.
According to Carroll, the classes
were deemed more effective be-
cause they were “interesting and
dynamic.”

When speaking about the
classes, Carroll applauds them say-

’ ing, “Students here work hard; this

advice will make their work more
effective.”
