THE DAVIDSONIAN

Editorial Hopetuls

Charles Cornwell

The primary aim of a good
college magazine should be to
interest. to entertain, and to
amuse its readers. There are
various ways of achieving this
goal, and I'd like to tell you the
policy I would follow, if you
elect me editor of Scripts ‘n
Pranks.

First, the emphasis would
be on no one thing. An issue
can be devoted solely to hu-
mor, or it can carry only
literary articles. But | think

this student body is varied
enough to merit « varied
magazine. By having the
scope of ifs contents brosd-
ened, the magezine would in-
clude articles of every de-
scription. Then, | would hope,
each of you would find some-
thing of interest in every is-
sue. ;

Humor, most . definitely,
would not be neglected. Humor
is a necessary part of college
life and is vital to Scripts ‘n
Pranks. The use of cartoons,
humorous photography, and
satire would be continued.

There is a second type of
writing which has been some-
what overlooked. That is the
article of opinion. These ar-
ticles could cover such subjects
as trends in thought. recent
movies and books, local and na-
tional -events, and other sub:
jects of interest to you. The
spice of a controversy would
not detract from the merit of
the msgazine. Certainly there

Green commented on the sug-'

whether specific violations de-
manded expulsion from the ¢ol-
lege or merely suspension, de-'

“| believe the rule must

would be too many loop holes
if the rule was changed.

“Our two main projects are
relations between faculty and
council, and students and coun-
cil.

“In regard to the first, we are!
considering monthly supper
meetings with members of the
faculty to discuss campus is-
sues. One such meeting was
held this week.

“The councit will be

ing council meetings in the

is pleasure in watching a con-
troversy as it sweeps along.
Short stories and poems
which have something to say
and which say it effectively
would also be included. The
college magazine should serve
as an outlet for campus writ-
ers, but the primary aim of
the magazine — to interest
and entertain you — should
not be abandoned in favor of

a mere “publishing house”
magazine.

I would favor opening the
magazine to anyone who wishes
to contribute to it. Selections
would be made on the basis of
quality and general appeal. To
give you a varied and enter-
taining magazine would be my
aim if elected editor.

Ed Spivey
What is the function of a stu-
dent magazine. such as Seripts
‘n Pranks? This is very much

. gn individual question; its an-

swers would vary as widely as
do the persons ot whom it is
asked. I don't propose to an-
swer this question definitively;
the best I can do is to try to
make clear my own position on
the subject.

In my opinion, a student
magazine is just that: a stu-
dent magazine. It arises from
and is addressed to students.
In this particular instance,
it owes more than ordinary
allegiance to this student

body, as it is financed
through fees paid by that
group.

This does not mean that the
magazine. should pander to the
“primal instinets” alone. As an
official publication of the col-

lege. it also has a responsibility
to be worthy of that institu-
tion. It has a responsibility to
those students who create as
well as to those who consume,
if it is truly a student publica-
tion.

Many of you may say at this
point, “Oh ***! Another free-
floating sesthete!” This is not
true. I definitely intend, if
elected, to publish a magazine
which most students will enjoy.
Humor will be a major factor
in this, but it will be fresh hu-
mor; pertinent to this campus,
but not along the worn-out
lines seen in most campus mcz-
azines. It will try to free itself
alike from staleness and Vic-
torianism.

Above all, | feel, the maga-
zine must be a student pub-

lication. Very little, if any,

material will be lifted from
other magazines. There ere
many students on this cam
pus who are capable of pro-
ducing excellent humorous
as well as serious material,
and this the magazine will
encourage as far as it can.

Though Eddie Guest quota-
tions mzy win elections, I shall
be a non-conformist and give
you only the sincere words of
Eddic Spivey: “Far from seek-
ing some compromise, I will do
my best to unify two important
persons: the writer and the
reader.”

cluded in a budget of our
size, Working hand in hand
with othe editor, the printer,
and the engraver has taught
me what we can expect from
our resources. With this
knowledge | feel that 1 could
“get the most for my money”
in producing from our bud-
get.

In presenting an annual for
a particular year, the editor
must produce an accurate, read-
able, meaningful representation
of that year. The nature of an
annual is such that each edition
is fundamentally the same. The
editor, then, must offer through
his‘ own individuality and ori-
ginality a book which will be
exclusively different.

This fall I represented Quips
& Cranks at the national con-
vention of the Associated Col-
legiate Press in Chicago. There
I was able to compare our year-

notice general trends of cur-

rent annual design and compo-
sition, and to attend instructive
lectures and discussion groups.
This valuable experience could
be quite useful in producing
next year’s annual.

Editorship of the ennuvaf,
as with any privilege, entails
tremendous responsibility —
co-ordination of » staff, su-
pervision of the planning,
and selection and organiza-
tion of a well qualified staff.
All photographs appearing in
the yearbook should have
something to say. The editor
should plan these pictures
with such a purpose in mind.

Copy,
must also be well planned, for
as we read this, it too, will take
on a reminiscent meaning.

I advocate no radical change;
but if honored by election, I
will dedicate myself to the pro-
duction of a distinctive annual

book with national winners, to for 1960.

Devoted Gentleman

Continued From Page One)
the Army arrived, and that in
the confusion he got the Navy.

Telling of his experiences
at “Boot Camp,” he related
an incident on one of the
obstacle courses. He was
running along the course and
when he saw the next “ob-
stacle” before him, he turned
to the Instructor who was
beside him and said, “Sir, |
am old enough to be your
father and | would be grate-
ful if you would consider me
as such.” He either had ea
sense of humor or realized
his inevitable defeat for he
graciously consented to let
me run around, instead of
over, the next few hazards.”
in the end, Or. Davidson re-
ceived his commission, but
the means still worried him,
even when the war was over.
“| dreaded every moment of
the first two years after my
return from the Navy to the

College. 1 expected to see
that officer any moment de-

manding that f recommend
him for ao position en the

faculty as | had promised to
do for his recommending me
for my commissions.”

In January of 1936, Professor
Davidson returned to his po-
sition with the College, and has
remained continuously ever
since — no leave end no sab
batical. “I was supposed to get
‘off a little last year,” he said.

“but we got the money for the
library and my wife had a baby. |
Two good reasons why I had to
stay.”

A regional writer of worthy
note, he has written numer-
ous books, including “Friend
of the People,” “Piedmont
Partisan,” and « novel,
“Cloud Over Catawba.” His
other writings es well as
many interesting additional
events of his life are listed
under his name’ in Who's
Who.

During the Summer months,
Dr. Davidson spends his time
writing. His family spends their
summers in Blowing Rock, as
his wife has done ever since
they were married.

A cheerful personality to ;
contact under all circum: |
stances, Dr. Davidson con be |
casily spotted at a distance
by his erect posture and |
brisk walk. The double. |
breasted pin-striped suit and
the cigarette holder have be-
come trademarks of his.

Still dusting the plaque he
has just removed from the wall
and commenting on the history
of the student that made it for
him, he h-nded it to me and
said, “This is how I feel about
this place.” And in his own
words ware: “Davidson College
ss way of life. Based on the
hines of the mind. Tempered

manners and morality.”

The Quips and Cranks has
become in the last several years
a somewhat stereotyped publi-
cation, technically good, but re-
lying too much on yearbooks
of the past. There are, however,
opportunities for innovation in
each publication, without any
radical change of the book as
a whole.

The editor must be able to
recognize the need for ori-
ginality in his book, for no

one, particularly a senior, de-
sires a publication that is a
mere reprint of book of the
preceeding year. My ideas for
the Quips and Cranks are not
those of radical revision, but
rather of innovation and
modification where needed.

One section of the book that

deserves such consideration is

the fraternity section. The pos-
sibility of a folio of informal
shots selected to represent all
fraternities, together with a
longer copy, and presented in
conjunction with the Interfra-
ternity Council spread, would
give a badly needed boost to
the whole fraternity section.
This could be constructed in
such a way that it would por-
tray a year's activities of a
typical Davidson social fraterni-
ty, yet individual fraternities
would still be given their own
section for copy and pictures

applying specifically to them.

One of the prime requisites
of an outstanding yearbook
is that it conveys to the read-
er a logical and impartial ac-
count of a complete year’s
activities, and is edited so
that copy and pictures are
carefully integrated in order
that the reader may grasp as
clear an understending as is
possible through words and
photographs. The ideal year-
book should be designed with
the interests of the students
in mind, but should also be
intelligible to one who is not
8 member of the college com-
munity.

Having had the experience of
Business Manager of a year-
book a few years ago, I am fa-
miliar with the business aspect
of annual production as well
as with editorship. The editor-
ship of the Quips and Cranks
entails tremendous responsibili-
ty, and determined effort, all of

y, which I'am willing to accept if
i I'am honored by election.

Bob Jones
Before anyone undertakes
the task of producing a college
yearbook, he must first decide
the purposes of his publication
and who its readers will be.

There is some degree of
contraversy in this area —
whether it is the duty of the
yearbook to present the col-
lege to the interested public
or to portray the student life,
particularly that of the sen-
lor in his final year. There
is no reason why both ideas
cannot be used by any editor.

In addition, it is my belief
that the majority of readers of
the college annual are the stu-
dents and alumni of the insti-
tution. Such a publication is in
theory dedicated to the Senior
Class of the institution it rep-
resents and should accordingly
endeavor to present to the sen-
ior a pictorial and verbal ac-

Finally, it is my objective
that the 1960 Quips and Cranks
be designed in such a manner
that it will serve both as a
reference guide to activities of
the college and as a portrayal
of the life of the Davidson Col-
lege student, so that in the fu-
ture he may read the yearbook
and accurately and vividly re-
call his career at Davidson.

Only through the attainment
of such goals can any editor
publish a yearbook that will
properly represent the students
and the institution to which it
is dedicated.
