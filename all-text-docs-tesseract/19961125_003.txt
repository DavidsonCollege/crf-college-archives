Humanities
program will
be reviewed
in spring

Professors Boye, Kaylor,
Kazee, Krentz, and Ortmayer
sparked much debate with their
proposal to replace the Humani-
ties Program with seminars for
first year students.

However, the Educational
Policy Council (EPC) will not
consider anything seriously until
at least late spring. With two ex-
ternal reviewers coming in
March, the Humanities Program
will be under intense ee
this year.

“We are going to need time
to digest the information from
the reviewers. If any changes are
going to be contemplated they
will not happen until we have a
full review of the programas part
of the strategic planning process,”
says Robert Williams, Dean of
Faculty. ;

Beyond humanities,
Davidson’s writing program in
general is being evaluated. Class
of ‘99 member of EPC Chris
Martin says, “The proposal was
meant to encourage debate and
discussion about the composi-
tion requirement, rather than ef-
fect an immediate implementa-
tion of its suggestion about the
Humanities Program.”

This may not be the last of
the proposals. “People should not
have a sense that it is either this
proposal or not. The whole col-
lege community will be talking
about this,” says committee mem-
ber Professor Lynn Poland:

No action regarding the Hu-
manities Program is going to be
taken for quite a while.

“The proposal is a simple-
minded solution to a complex
problem,” says Williams. “It’s
the answer to a question that
hasn’t been asked yet.”

Some students barter butts for bag

The Davidson Health Center
heldits first Great American Smoke
Out last Thursday in an effort to
spread awareness of the dangers of
smoking and to encourage smok-
ers to quit.

The two majorevents that took
place were the Butts for Bagels
exchange and the lung capacitor
test.

The Butts for Bagels exchange
was simple. As Georgia Ringle,
coordinator of the event and Health
Service Educator, explains, “‘Stu-

dents and faculty are given the

opportunity to trade cigarettes or
chewing tobacco for bagels .... I

‘have had, many people give me

whole packs.”

This trade is a way to get smok-
ers to make some small commit-
ment to stop smoking. Many stu-
dents also received survival kits to
help them quit for good.

Ringle says the event was
“more successful than expected ...
We gave away over 100 survival
kits to smokers who want to quit
and [to] friends of smokers ... I’m
very hopeful about getting casual
smokers to quit.”

The lung capacitor test was
administered by Bob Noble, Man-
ager for Respiratory Care Service
at Iredell Memorial Hospital, and
Valerie Velte, Director of Com-
munity Health and Wellness at
Iredell Memorial Hospital. The
test detects the effects of smoking
by measuring a person’s lung ca-
pacity with the expected capac-
ity.

Both Noble and Velte agree
that the event was a success.

Velte says there was “a great
response, both students and fac-
ulty participated ... And a few
people have decided to quit ... ”

Velte also says, “The major
purpose of the event is to remind
people of the effects of smoking,

Although the Smoke Out was
successful, there were difficulties
in getting people to; participate.
Ringle found that she had to “re-

Noble adds that “Many people
just don’t think all the health prob-
lems related to smoking will hap-
pen to them, and nicotine can also
prevent quitting due to its addic-
tive nature.” Velte says many
people are “afraid to participate in
the lung capacity test because they

. are afraid they will fail.”
