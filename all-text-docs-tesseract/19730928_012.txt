On Sept. 13, the U. S. Office of
Education notified the College
that it has been made the
recipient of a $25,000 Planning
Grant.

According to Vice President
for Academic Affairs John M.
Bevan, ‘‘These funds will
enable us to explore the
possibilities of a cooperative
education program for
economically disadvantaged
students and to explore the
coordination of placement,
vocational counseling, Career/
Service, and summer in-
ternships.”’

Director of Career/Service,
Randall R. Kincaid Jr. will be
responsible for overseeing the
planning, and will be working
very closely with Director of the
Student Counseling Service
William B. Hight Jr.

Kincaid said that ‘‘the plan-
ning program will include con-
sultation with all elements of
the college community and if it
appears there is a need for ad-
ditional vocationl services
then some of the money can be
used to implement the
program.”

He noted that students will be
an integral part of the planning
program, since they are the
ones who can tell if they feel
more vocational services are
needed.

Kincaid said, ‘‘What we need
to do is to build on the strong
base services."

The base Davidson already
has is composed of the four Pre-
professional committees
(Medical, Law, Ministerial,
and, now this year,
Managerial), the Student Coun-
seling Service, the Union's
Placement program, and other
activities, such as faculty ad-
visors who aid students in
making career decisions.

If there is to be any im-
plementation of the funds after

... Governance Considered

(Continued from page 1)

The Faculty has primary
responsibility in two areas:
Educational Policy and Ad-
missions. The uvther three areas
are the primary responsibility
of the President

Advisory Councils in these
areas have the same powers of

review as in Model I, but their
composition differs.

The President's Council on
Fiscal, Personnel, and Develop-
ment Affairs is composed of the
Faculty and SGA Budget Con-
ference committees. The Ad-
visory Councils on athletics and
campus life are formed by the
College Conference.

... Arts Crowded

(Continued from page 7)

Even the music department,
which holds the largest amount
of space in Cunningham is
feeling the space squeeze.

“The biggest areas of concern
are our classroom spaces,”
declared Professor of Music
Wilmer Welsh.

“‘We have reached the ab-
solute limit in terms of seating
space. We've gone from around
22 students to 50 in music ap
preciation class last year,”
explained.

With the increasing number
of students taking music cour-
ses, Welsh pointed out that the
number of listening devises,
such as tapes, records and

cassettes has also increased, |

necessitating a larger area to

absorb the overflow.
Considering these and other

problems of limited facilities,

the question was raised as to
whether the fine arts at David-
son was taking a back seat to
the other departments in the

college in its requests.
Replied Welsh, ‘‘I don’t think
so. Anything that we ever

asked for in the past that was
reasonable, we received.”’
Jackson however has a dif-
ferent attitude as to how the ar-
ts are received at Davidson:
“For all the time and the hell of
a lot on money that goes into the
Davidson Narional Print and
Drawing Competition, I'd be
surprised if 10 percent of the
college ever came to see it.”’

Twice during each school
year the College Conference
will discuss matters of general

college concern in_ public
meeting. ;
The Conference also

organizes itself into five ad-
visory councils to the President
on Student Conduct, Campus
Life, Athletics, Religious Life,
and Co-curricular activities.

Thus, the governing bodies
are the Faculty, the College
Conference, and the SGA
Senate. Students have limited
participation by membership of
Faculty committees and
representation on the College
Conference, but no prescribed
role for Senate action.

Communication between
Faculty and Trustees is em-
phasized. The office of Faculty
Chairman pro-tempore is com-
parable to the present office of
SGA President in general
responsibilities and duties.

Once more the fact need be
stated, that Model I and Model
II are, in both systemic and
specific concerns, for
discussion only.

From Office Of Edu

the planning, it will be super-
vised by the Student Counceling
Service.

The college submitted an ap-
plication for the funds, with a
proposal written by Kincaid and
Professor of Psychology John
D. Kelton, to the Office of
Education last fall.

Some of the various reasons

cation

for the year-long delay were
hold-ups in and
strangely enough, President
Nixon’s veto of a bill cutting off
funds to Cambodia.

At any rate, the Office of
Education received the funds in
August and Davidson was
notified of the grant in mid-
September.

... Senators Elected

(Continued from page 2)

He further noted that up-
perclassmen parties could be
either open or closed to the
public.

Appearing before the Senate
with a request for funds was
Frank Farmer, leader of APO
the national service fraternity.

He indicated that APO ac-
tivities other than the bookstore
had ‘eaten up”’ funds. APO now
has $107 from last year and can
expect to make $125 this term,
Farmer said. He added that
APO has some $300 of books on
the shelves.

Finally, Senator Vince Rabil
reported on the Student Con-
duct Council. He related that a
new statement on plagarism
has been added to the gover-

nance manual.

Rabil also noted that in a
meeting with Will Terry, Dean
of Students, Terry expressed
concern about students taking
food from Slater food service
without paying. Terry
suggested the Council do
something before ‘‘the idea that
it’s O.K. to take food from
Slater is worked into the fiber of
the student body.”’
