Bongs waste number one KA’s

By BAD BERNARD

Wednesday. October 18th:
The lights of the house have
been turned down low, but one
can still see the numerous
bodies scattered across the
front yard in their torn and
bloody garments. The flag is
at half-mast.

On the back porch of the
small house sits a once-proud
warrior in a gray uniform,
head in hands. He weeps large
tears that slowly trickle into
his grey beard.

Could this be Robert E. Lee

TIM GOODELL and Charles Cornwell di

weeping over Appamatox?
No, it’s just H-man mourning
his team’s loss to the carpet-
baggers and scalawags of the
Bongs.

The KA’‘s had gone 16
yvames im a row without. tast-
ing the bitter pill of defeat.
During this stretch they am-
assed reputations and records
in the manner of Bud Wilkin-
son's Oklahoma Sooners or
Johnny Wooden's UCLA
Bruins.

But Goliath met his David
on that Autumn afternoon.

The Bongs were no patsies.
They had produced winning
seasons for four straight years

—

vet remained in relative ob-
scurity. Behind the arm of
Clayton Rogers (27 for 38, 345
vards—only 15 yards short of
P. Minter’s 1934 record) the
Bongs pulled the upset of the
season.

Clayton must now fight a
constantly ringing phone and
battle reporters just to get to
class.

His side kicks, Steve Justus
and David Swaim, have both
moved into plush apartments
on the outskirts of Cornelius
and have tried to remain
low-key in preparation for the
upcoming tourney.

Runners clobber opponents

By JOHN DAVIS
Staff Writer

The Davidson cross-country
team hosted a 4-way meet on
Saturday, Oct. 15, and ran its
best race of the year. The
Wildcats clobbered Georgia
Stateand J.C. Smith, while
losing to Wake Forest, to close
out their dual meet season
with a 6-5 record.

Coty Pinckney again led the
squad. and finished fourth
after dueling with Wake’s top
three runners for the majority
of the race. His time of 32:15 is
a record for Davidson’s 10,000
meter course.

In addition, the team’s
depth asserted itself, and John
Davis, George Strobel, Bart

Landess, and Jeff Morrow —

finished ninth, thirteenth, fif-

teenth..and sixteenth resneg-.,

tively. Also scoring were Va-
sili Carperos, nineteenth, and
improving junior Bob Sweet,
who was twentieth.

On the 22nd, at the State
Cross-Country Champion-
ships in Raleigh, Pinckney
had the greatest race of his
career and blitzed to a trium-
phant thirteenth place finish
and a school record 31:53
clocking for 10,000 meters. It
was the highest finish in a
state meet for a Davidson
Runner since 1964, and Pinck-

ney now holds virtually all of

the school’s cross-country re-

cords.
However, the Wildcats
could only manage a ninth

. place finish as a team, as the

remainder of the squad finish-
ed well back -in the field of 65
runners. Davis was fourty-
fourth, Landess fifty-third,
Strobel fifty-fourth, Morrow
fifty-fifth, Tom Scott sixtieth,
and Carperos sixty-fourth.

Davidson's final meet, the
Southern Conference Champ-
ionships, will be held on Nov.
5th at VMI, where Furman
ahd Appalachian State are the
favorites.

KA‘s are nowhere near fin-
ished. Inside word has it that
in some of their last closed
practices and film sessions,
they have been using the
Houston veer along with sev-
eral of the crossing “options for
the swingman.

The black cloud was not
only over the KA house last
week. It also managed to
darken up the plans of some of
the beach boys at the SAE
house. After losing to an
inspired-from-above Old Men
team (the game was played on
the Sabbath), disserision has
wrecked havoc upon the kha-
ki-colored klan.

Several players have ex-
pressed dissatisfaction with
both the front office and the
coaching staff. (In this case,
it's the same person.)

Jim ‘“My voice has always
been this way” Richards, all
IMAC for the past two years,
is one-of the leading bitchers,
“If things are not worked out
here in a couple of days, I
could easily be playing for a
West Coast team next year.’

Any implied comparison be-
tween the E's and the Yankees
is unintentional.

The Old Men, who nipped
the E's 24-19, relied on former
Heisman trophy winners Yah-
weh and Johnny Rogers. Said
Rogers, ‘Damn, I don’t be
lieve I've seen Yawie look as
good since the Oklahoma
game of ‘70.

Word is that outside line-
backer and Chevrolet Defen-
sive player of the game, Dave
“Fro Man" Shi could be the
criminal element in flickerball.

It is not known whether Jeff
Frank will be able to resume
his duties as tennis coach this
year because he has not quit
jumping up and down since
the victory.

Congratulations are in order
for Jeff who got his first date
in years after the game.

MacFleet and Stuff contin-
ued to put it together after
John Ratliff's departure and
molested the F-one J-one’'s.
The FIJI's were undefeated

going into the game but finally
showed us what they were
made of.

Bernie and H-man also feel
we need to say a few more
words about Mac and Stuff,
our darkhorse favorite to win
the tournament. Few more
words.

The big event of the week-
end however was the begin-
ning of Varsity Spades at
Davidson. This year’s team,
composed of Earnest Reigel
and Pete ‘‘Everybody knows
my last name,’’ decapitated
the young men from South-
western.

Second-string shuffler Rob
“Hollywood” Cordell, didn't
see any action but said of his
teammates’ play, ‘‘Even
though our opponents were
pretty much wasted, I think it
was a big win for us.”

Davidson now travels to
South Carolina A&T for its
next match.

Three on Three basketball is
coming up on the calendar and
Bernie feels that it will be a
wide open battle for the crown,
“One has to look at the facts
before he can make a _ predic
tion and the facts this year is
that it is going to be hard to
make a prediction and no facts
really stand out too clear.”

Hogman added, ‘In regular
season play I have to favor the
squatty bodies, but since this
is not regular season play, I
can't favor them.”

When play starts October
30th, look for one of the teams
in the tourney to win and
remember where you heard it.
