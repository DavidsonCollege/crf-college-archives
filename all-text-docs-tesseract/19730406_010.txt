The Bavidsouian Tennis Extends Streak To $

In ECU, VMI Shutout Wins

By GORDON WIDENHLOUSE
Sports Editor

With convincing wins) over
East Carolina and VMI. the
Davidson tennis team extended
their winning: streak to eight
games. prior to vesterday’s
match with Harvard

“They were probably the two
easiest matches we will have
the entire season.”’ commented
Head Coach Jett Frank.

His argument is well founded
by the results. as Davidson
swept through both matches by
identical 9-0 tallies. No Wildcat
netter lost a single set.

David Weaver. playing what
Frank called ‘very strong ten-
nis,” led the Cats to the double
victory on Tuesday. He
smashed the number one player
of both the Pirates and the
Keydets.

“Weaver keeps getting better
as the season goes on,” praised
Frank. ‘He is just so strong. I

think he has a good chance to
win the rest of his matches"

Keeping the top six singles in-
tact were Kevin) Menton. Bill
Allen, Maarten) Ruys.) iM
Lankenau and Rick Quinby

Frank said he thought Quinby
Was improving rapidly and
really has a good hold on the
number six position.

The number three doubles
team ts still a big question mark
for the Cats. It will probably be

either Quinby and Lankenau or |

the duo of Jim Dorsett and Gary
Bressler. Each of the two com-
binations played Tuesday and
won convincingly.

Frank feels the two tough con-
ference matches are the up-
coming ones with Furman and
Appalachian.

“Both of these are, un-
fortunately. on the road.” said
Frank. “They will be the two
hardest: matches in the con-
terence, We really want them

Weaver Aims For Tournament

By MARK CONNORS
Asst. Sports Editor

Playing his best tennis ever,
No. 1 singles player David
Weaver is back to defend his
Southern Conference title.

The senior pre-med major
came to Davidson from Wood-
berry-Forest with the belief
that ‘Davidson would improve
my chances of getting into
medical school.

“Tennis was not a major in-
fluence because I was not
aware of the excellence of the
program at Davidson.” he said

In his freshman vear. Weaver
Was one ot the tew rookies to
make the varsity squad. It was
in this first vear that Weaver
cited his most outstanding im-
provements

In his junior vear Weaver
moved up to his present No. |

position. He attributes his im-
provement and advancement to
the inner team competition.

‘Everyone on the team,
especially our foreign students,
is always pushing each other,
and it forces one to be con-
sistent. I'm playing more con-
sistently than ever now
primarily because of this team
push.

“The rain has hurt my game
recently because I haven't had
a chance to play that much in
the past week and it might have
hurt me a little shape-wise.”’ he
said.

Head Coach Jett Frank. in his
first vear as head coach, has
been very pleased with
Weaver's pertormances to date
“David is an extremely smart
player and very adept at being
able to analyze the weaknesses
of his opponent's game

“David is also a very con-

fident) plaver He never

believes. regardless, that there
is any chance he’s going to
lose,"* he said.

Frank emphasized this
quality as extremely important
for Weaver because of the
pressure being in the top singles

, position.

“David always has an ex-
treme amount of pressure on
him no matter who the match is
against because every team has
a good No. | player.’ Frank
said.

Besides his unique court in-
telligence. Frank cited several
other qualities of Weaver's
game. “David is basically an
aggressive plaver. He has a
very strong serve. good ground
strokes. and he moves and
places the ball really well.”

Although his No. 1 singles
position is his most important
asset to the team. Weaver ts
also one of the finest doubles
plavers on the team

Sailing Team Captures Third Place.
Begins Preparations For Duke Meet

By JOHN McELVEEN
Staff Writer

The Davidson sailors travel to
Durham, North Carolina this
weekend to participate in the
Duke Regatta.

Daryl Douglas. Jimmy Hun-
ter and Frank Sommerville are
all in contention. The skippers
that will represent Davidson at
this regatta will be determined
by performance during this
week's practice. The top two of
these three will participate.

“The boats will be quite dif-
ferent from the Jets.” com-
mented Jimmy Hunter. These
windmills are quick. responsive
boats. and are a lot faster than
the Jets, and probably the
fastest boat we will sail all
year.”

A foggy. rainy and cold day
was the setting of the
Elimination Regatta, held this
past weekend at Lake Norman.

“It. wasn't all bad.” stated
Douglas. “Toward the middle of
the day. the rain let up and the
wind picked up. Even though it

wus sul lousy to look at. it
made for good sailing.”

Roger Powell, a Davidson
alumnus and former sailing
team commodore, braved the
weather and made up the Race

Committee.

He looked on as the Davidson
Sailing Team took third in the
regatta, one point behind the
College of Charleston.

“We had quite a tew ap-
portunities where we couldhave
taken over second place.” said
Douglas. “but we didn't take
advantage of them.”’

Hunter ended up in second
place as skipper in B-Division,

while Douglas was third in the
A-Division

“Although we timished third
behind the College of Charleston
and The Citadel. we did quality
for the championships.” stated
Douglas. “That was the whole
importance of the regatta.”

Though no one ts certain, the
championships will probably be
held at Clemson College. They
are scheduled for the 14th of
April.

Both Frank and Weaver are
looking with optimism to the
Southern Comerence Cham-
pionships. Frank has classified
Weaver as a “warm weather
player’ and is sure that
Weaver's best tennis is yet to
come.

“David takes a while to get
going. His best tennis always
comes towards the end of the
season,” he said.

With Weaver now playing bet-
ter than ever before, his chance
of retaining his Southern Con-
ference title is verv good.

Dadby so we Gan get Ene nen et
one seedings in the conference
tournament.”

Tomorrow the Cats tace
Washington and Lee. The Fur-

man match tollows this on
Tuesday.
“The Duke match a week

from Friday will probably be
the roughest one of the season,
save the UNC contest,” said
Frank. “But I think we can win
it if we play our best.”

The team seems to be getting
stronger as they play each
match. If they continue at this
pace, they will be in great shape
for the conference tournament.

“I hope we improve some
more for the conference tour-
ney.” smiled Frank. “But Iam
very well pleased with the
team’s play thus far.”

With its record standing at 12-
1, the lone set back to
powerful UNC, the tennis team
is in command of the con-
ference. If they thrive on the
pressure matches, as Frank
feels they can, they will be in
excellent position for the tour-
ney.

~The thing that impressed me
the most was that we were able
to keep our concentration high
even when we ran away with
the match.” explained Frank.
“We should be ready for

anybody.”
