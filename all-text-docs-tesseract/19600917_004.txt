For Fine Arts Building

The Barger Construction Company of Mooresville was the lowest of eight bid-
ders as estimates were received on August 30, for the erection of the Fine Arts
Building. Because of last minute accoustical changes however, the contract was not

awarded that day.

The architects have com-
pleted the changes and if the
estimate on the changes is fav-
orable, the. contract is expected
to be signed with Barger at the
first of next week.

Under the present plans
ground will be broken for the
new building in the week of
September 26. The contract
provides for its completion by
September 11, 1961. The anti-
cipated cost is between $625,000

Library Announces
Organization Change

Dr. Chalmers G. Davidson announced a major change

in the library’s organization

this week, and called atten-

tion. to the appointment of a new staff member.

Miss Carrie Lanier Brittain
has replaced Mrs. Nancy Davis,
who resigned last spring to ac-
company her husband to Flori-
da. Miss Brittain comes from
Davis and Elkins College in
West Virginia. She holds a pro-
fessional library degree from
the University of North Caro-
lina and a masters degree in
English from the University of
West Virginia, Dr. Davidson
maintains that she is thus the
best qualified staff member that
the library has ever employed
in respect to reference assist-
ance.

A new reserve book reading
room has been set-up in the old
modern fiction reading room
on the second floor. The re-
vised reserve book system is
experimental this year.

The new system works as
follows: Members of the faculty
will designate reserve books as

“open” or “closed” books. Open
books may be taken from the
shelves in the reading room
without being checked out.
However, the student must use
the book in the reading room
and is not allowed to take it
to other parts of the library.
Closed books must be checked
out by the librarian on duty
in the reserve book reading
room. The student is also re-
quired to use these books in the
same room.

Dr. Davidson said, “The new
system, and _ the _ structural
changes that go along with it,
are ‘experimental. We hope that
it will solve the problem of
availability of reserve books.”

He said that a major reason
for the change is that in the
past, students have kept re-
serve books out of circulation.
for an unreasonable length of
time.

vice-president of Harper & Bro.
thers and formerly chairman of
The Board of Higher Education
of New York City, who, on Fri-
day evening, spoke on the topic
of “The Role of People in
Achieving Excellence in Liberal
Education.”

The following morning a dis-
oussion was held on an address,
entitled “Assuring Learning
Through Teaching In The First
Two College Years,” that Dr.
Tead had given at another meet-
ing. :
This discussion was followed,
later in the morning, by discus-
sions of the curriculum and
“The Religious Life Program
at Davidson.”

The luncheon on Saturday
~was highlighted by an address
by Dr. Goodrich C. White, Chan-
cellor of Emory University, who
spoke on the topic “Some Ob-
jectives For a Church-Related

1960's.

Following luncheon the par-
ticipants broke up into eight
seminar groups. All took up the
topic “Specific Ways in which
Faculty, Students and Trustees

Can Strengthen Davidson's Edu-
cational Program From 1960-
70."

The final session of the re-
treat was taken up with sum-
‘mary reports from the seminars
and by a summing up of the
Retreat by Dean Johnston and
the Consultants.

In an interview earlier this
week President Martin stated
“We had the general objectives
of seeking to find better ways
of making Davidson's total pro-
gram more effective.

“Another of the objectives
was to. bring faculty members
and trustees together so there
would be better understanding
between the groups.”
