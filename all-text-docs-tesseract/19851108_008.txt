Who's On First ?

By ANDY BARRON

Why, why, why, why, why?
! Why was Whitey Herzog named
iimanager of the year in the National
League by the baseball writers? Anyone
could have taken the Cardinals to the
World Series with all the great years their
players had. Willie Mcgee didn’t hit .353
because of great moves by Whitey Her-
zog. Just because St. Louis wasn't sup-
posed to have a great season this year
means the sports writers who made those
predictions were wrong. Pete Rose kept a
bunch of nobodies in the pennant race
until September and deserves the honor.

Why doesn’t every team in the NFL
use an offensive or defensive lineman in
the backfield on short yardage situation?
Certainly Chicago's William Perry isn’t
the only lineman who could perform such
a task.

Why does the NHL condone fight-
ing? Hockey is a rough game and some

fighting will occur when tempers flair.
However, there are too many “goons”
playing professional hockey because the
NHL lets intimidation and completely
unnecessary roughness go undeterred.
Anyone who watches hockey more than
just a few times realizes that the fighting
gets old quickly. Hockey is one of the
fastest, most graceful and most exciting
sports around when fighting is kept to a
minimum. Aggressive players, yes,
goons, no.

Why is artificial turf allowed in out-
door stadiums? Piles of evidence prove
the surface causes tremendous strain on
knees and bones and most fans would
agree the rugs ruin the games meant to be
played on grass (especially baseball and
soccer). Thank goodness baseball com-
missioner Peter Uberroth has made grass
stadiums a prerequisite for new franch-
ises.

A few unanswered questions from the world of sports ...

Why is pro basketball so boring when
college basketball ranks among the most
exciting sports around? The endless sea-
son of the pro version has to be a factor,
but I think pro basketball suffers from ex-
cess talent, if that is possible.

Why can’t Billy Martin last a full year
with the Yankees? He did a great job
again this year. If the Yankees start los-
ing again, you can bet new Yankee skip-
per Lou Pinella will be looking over his
shoulder.

Why is Mary Lou Retton on every
time I go near a television? She drove me
crazy during the Olympics (I thought the
Rumanian gymnast should have beaten
her). One more Evérready commercial
and I'll go crazy!

Why don’t college football teams
have a national championship tourna-
ment like every other sport? The game is
so balanced and has so many good teams
that no champion by poll will ever be

legitimate. There has to be a way to work
out a tournament that uses the bowl
games so that, God forbid, the infamous
“Bowl Committees” don’t lose all that
money their games generate.

Why do 16 out of 21 teams in the
NHL make the play-offs? Talk about
making the regular season meaningless.

Why is Joaquin Andujar such a jerk?

Why do people care about the NFL, a
league in which every team in one divi-
sion (the AFC Central) has a 4-5 record?

Most importantly, why doesn’t the
school build some more street hockey
courts? As it is now, the legions of loyal
hockey players have only one place on
the whole campus to play (next to
Richardson Field), and there they have to
put up with those pesky basketball
players. Come on powers that be at
Davidson, this is a real need.

SAE , Babes lead going into [MAC tournament

By EDWIN PAGE

It’s that time again. The leaves
ure changing and the weather is
cooling off, a sure sign that it’s al-
most playoff time. Davidson's an-
nual rite of humiliation — for
freshmen, — flickerball season,
ended this week and post season
action starts Sunday.

In the men’s division, SAE’s
Drop and Give posted a perfect re-
cord to maintain the coveted top
spot in the rankings all season
long. KA Gold rebounded from a
thrilling preseason exhibition loss
to Drop and Give to go 5-0 in the

regular season and lay claim to the
number two spot. A PiKA team,
Say You're Scared, is likewise
undefeated and goes into the tour-
nament ranked third. A second
hoddy team, J.J. gold, posted a 4-
| record, good enough for the
fourth spot.

Three freshmen teams, First
Center’s entry Uba-Duba and the
Cosby Kids (2-2) , Third East's
OFF (1-2-1), and Kinky Pinky's
(2-2), actually managed to grasp
the peculiarities of flickerball well
enough to make the playoffs. As a
reward for this achievement, each

will be fed as an appetizer to one
of the top four seeds in the first
round Sunday.

In the women’s division, pe-
rennial powerhouse Penthouse
Babes is once again undefeated
and the tournament favorite, but
they will have some tough aquatic
competition if they are to repeat as
champions. The 4-0 Crabs and the
4-1 Barracudas will have some
say in the outcome of the tourna-
ment. The big surprise of the
women’s side is number five
Rapunzel’s Revenge, based on

Fourth Rich, these long haired,
tower dwelling types have mas-
tered the game at an unusually ten-
der age, and could do well.

Rain has played havoc with
this year’s regular season, post-
poning several games. Accumu-
lated rust could therefore become
an important factor in the early
rounds, making for some potential
upsets. First round action begins
Sunday and continues through
Tuesday. Schedules are posted in
the gym, Chambers, and all over
your neighborhood. The IMAC

Council requests that you check
your refereeing assignments and
make sure to be at the your as-
signed games. To make it worth
your while payment is $4 per
game during the playoffs instead
of the usual two.

Can KA or PiKA make the
SAE’s Drop and give? Will the
Trajans Rage? Can anyone defeat
OFF? Can the Barracudas or the
Crabs take a bite out of the Babes”
For the answers to these and more
questions, stay tuned. Same Bat
time, same Bat channel.

X-Country finishes fourth

By RAND HARTSELL

Davidson's women’s cross country
team took part in a bit of history on Satur-
day. November 2: they competed in the first
Southern Conference women’s cross-coun-
try championship held in Charleston, SC at
the Citadel's home course. Davidson's
women finished fourth ahead of Western
Carolina but behind champion East Tennes-
see State, Appalachian State, and Marshall.
The men’s team beat Western Carolina
also, but fell prey to the rest of the field as
East Tennessee won its eighth consecutive
title. Marshall, Appalachian, Citadel, Fur-
man, Tennessee- Chattanooga, and VMI
also beat Davidson.

Sophomore Kappa Peddy led David-
son's women, finishing 17th overall. Nurs-
ing an injured knee, Peddy turned in a 20:06
performance over the flat 5000 meter (3.1
miles) course.

“We did about as well as we could have
cc sidering our injuries,” assistant coach
S.rah Patterson said. Sophomore Morrow
Reeves has an injured knee which hobbled
her performance as well. Senior Judy dalton
linished second for the Cats, followed by
sophomore Laura Fannin, senior Caroline
Kelly, sophomores Sarah Longley and
Reeves, freshman Susan Austin and sopho-
more Debbie Niles.

East Tennessee senior (and shoe-in for
All American honors) Brian Dunne blazed
the Citadel's five-mile course in a torrid
23:39. Since joining the Southern Confer-
ence in 1978, ETSU has yet to lose either

the individual or team title. Davidson junior
Greg Foreman finished twenty-first overall
as he set a personal best for five miles in
26:08, 22 seconds faster than he thought he
had run. “I died between three and four
miles,” Foreman recalled, “but I was able to
dig out a good last mile.”

Senior Frank Hague was second for the
Cats with freshman Bill Whitfield, sopho-
more Bill Breidenstine, senior Rob Wat-
kins, junior Emil Cekada and sophomore
Chris Fisher and freshman Bob Cornish
rounding out Davidson’s team. “Five of us
set personal best records for five miles,”
Hague said. “We really put together a good
effort collectively.”

“It was really good to have a lot of sup-
porters cheering for us,” Foreman said, al-
luding to the number of Davidson suppor-
ters who showed up for the race, many of
whom, but not all, were students’ parents.
“Sarah's (Patterson) father helped me dur-
ing the race, especially when I needed some
inspiration to find a kick at the end of the
race.”

Most of the team (men and women) will
conclude their season on November 16 in
Greenville, SC at the NCAA district meet.
Dalton, who qualified for the NAIA Cham-
pionship in Kenosha, WI, will travel there
on November 23. Peddy has also qualified
but has opted to have orthopedic surgery
performed in order to repair her injured
knee. Foreman has also qualified for the
race but. as of this writing, is still unde-
cided.
