began its chase of outdoor records
in promising fashion with strong
meets at Florida A & M and Wake
Forest this past week. Though no
records have fallen yet, the men
seem poised for success.

Sophomore Duncan Spears led
the way for the Wildcats with light-
ning times in the 400m hurdles
(56. 6): and 400m relay split (50.5)

time makes him the 4th fastest in
Davidson history in the event.

a fast 5000m time of 15:37.8 at
Wake Forest. He and senior Chris

mark as two of Davidson’s finest
mid-distance runners. Freshman
Lee Sutton put the shot an out-
standing 45' 2 1/2", placing him
among the top ten shot putters, and
less than 5 feet from the school
record.

distance runners should cause
