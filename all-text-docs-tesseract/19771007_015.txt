Cats tackle Yellow Jackets

By HARRY GRIFFITH
Staff Writer

The Davidson Wildcat
Football team will take on the
Yellow Jackets of Randolph-
Macon in the Cats’ Homecom-
ing game on Saturday.

It is a crucial game for Ed
Farrell's gridders.

After consecutive thrash-
ings by Bucknell and Lehigh,
respectively, the momentum

pects the departments to give
majors the option of taking
Extended Studies 301 and 401
or an altered major program:

The proposal, adopted by
the EPC last spring, was held
' until this fall because ‘it was
worked out so late that there
was not time for the faculty to
consider it,”’ speculated Zim-
merman. “I think it is a poor
idea for faculty to develop
important policy late in the
spring anyway.”

Epes explained the recom-
endation was part of an overall
curriculum evaluation which
the EPC planned to present in
its entirity. He also said the
EPC needed explanations of
the proposals attached to the
document before it was pre-
sented to the faculty for vote.

The explanatory paragraphs
were written over the summer.

Epes and Zimmerman com-
’ mented on some of the recom-
mendations.

The majority of Extended
Studies will be under depart-
ments for ‘‘better overseeing
of teaching loads and maybe
Letter quality work,’’ said
Fpes. He explained the de-
vartmental listing also will
make transcripts easier to
understand.

‘‘We had in the past a
program that dealt with indi-
vidual faculty members; now
it deals with department
members,’’ he said.

‘‘Some people may argue
that departmental listing will
tell the departments what to
do,” said Epes. The proposed
policy may increase depart-
mental work, according to
him.

Zimmerman places himself
‘“‘on the side of those who do
rot want (required 301 and 401
prcgrams.( I tend to favor
ibclishing the mandatory na-
ure, but granting it liberally
to those who do want it.”

‘I think in some of the
sciences the Extended Studies

is burdensome on the faculty
if the student does not know
exactly what he is doing.

“IT sympathize with instruc-
tors. who have to knock their
brains out to motivate a
student who is not compe-
tent,’’ he said.

Epes expects recommenda-
tion three to cause the most
debate among the faculty.

“The debate will probably
be why is (interdisciplinary
Extended Studies (only open
to freshmen and sophomores?
Why not juniors and seniors?
My answer is ‘Yes, why not?’”’
he said.

“(The pass-fail grades) will
remove any danger of Exten-
ded Studies being an easy
grade or being called an easy
grade,” said Epes. ‘It will, I
think, let faculty sponsors
who are doing this over and
above the regular course load
have an easier job.”

“I myself would lean toward
grading, ’’ said Zimmerman.

Tough schedule slows start

By JOHN WILLINGHAM
Staff Writer

Being winless after five
outings and outscored by the
opposition nineteen to two,
could be enough to make any
coach wish the season would
end quickly.

But for Karl Kremser, who
finds himself in that position
as coach of the soccer team,
the optimism remains high.

In viewing the season thus
far, Kremser placed the major-}
ity of the blame for the poor)
start on the schedule that the
Wildcats have faced.

‘We're playing a major-
league schedule,”’ he cited and
then pointed out, that the
opposing school recruit stu-
dents specifically to play soc-
cer,

In contrast, Davidson has
never recruited a soccer play-
er.

Kremser does not try to use
that fact as a scapegoat
though.

‘We have sume :cany”

kids, Even though in most
games, we have been com-
pletely outmanned. Individu-
ally, when you look at us as a
team, we have been better
than some of the schools we
faced.”’

Playing without any scho-
larship players, Kremser ex-
pressed an understandable a-
mount of pride in the effort
of the soccer team thus far.

“The scores are not indica-
tive of the effort and improve-
ment they've made,” he re-
marked, ‘‘with the exception
of the Jacksonville game with
UNC-Chapel Hill,’’ which he
described as a ‘‘sensational ef-
fort’.

“sensational effort.’
Kremser noted that another

problem is that the players
have not completely adjusted
to his style of play. ‘‘Some-
times we seem to be confused
and hesitant,”’ he reasoned.

He hopes to control the
mental errors that come with
an adjustment to a new sys-
tem by drilling the players
until it all becomes second
nature to them.

The next big step for Krem-
ser is what he calls ‘tactical
thinking and understanding of
the game,’’ pointing out that
that will come as the season
progresses.

Having left behind a state
championship team in Miami,
Kre nser is not accustomed to
losing.

“T want to see results now,
rather than down the road,”’
he declared, but added that he
knew changes would not hap-
pen overnight.

However, he observed that
there was a new competitive
nature on the squad and
concluded that better times
should await the squad—the
remaining contests.

the team had after the first
two victories had faded.

A big win here, along with
victories in the upcoming
games with Guilford and
Hampden-Sydney, would give
the team the boost they need
before doing battle with such
powers as VMI,.,Delaware,
and Lafayette.

The players are confident,
though, despite the recent
setbacks.

“By no means are we down

Extended Studies as we do
now,’’ Epes said. Last year
only about 120 students parti-
cipated in the program.

He also explained that a
project may involve more than
one student.

“One senior faculty member
told me that he did not see
anything objectionalbe about
(the recommendation) and
went. on the say that we need
this kind of safety valve in the
curriculum,” said Epes.

‘‘T am some what encour-
aged if we pass this, that it

sophomore Extended Studies.
It may be better controlled, I
am not sure,” he concluded.

and out,’’ stressed quarter-
back Bob McCarthy.

The general consensus am-
ong the players seems to be
that the Cats are very capable
of winning, but mistakes and
mental letdowns have done
them in. :

Defensive tackle Frank
Fields said, ‘‘Weé want to get
back on the winning track. We
just have to play as well as we
can, and eliminate our mis-
takes.”

Randolph-Macon is 1-3 on
the year, but is coming off a
21-13 win over Washington
and Lee.

Coach Farrell has empha-
sized the fact that the Yellow
Jackets are a very emotional
team, and will be ready for
Davidson.

Last year the two teams
battled to a 0-0 tie at Ran-
dolph-Macon, in a game that
Farrell thinks should have
gone to Davidson.

“They played a very emo-
tional game against us. We
weren't as emotional. They
tied us in a game which we all
feel we should have won.”’

In stressing the importance
of this week's game, he added,
“Their game with us last year
was the turning point in their
season. They probably see this
game as the point in their
season to get things going in
the right direction.”

The Jackets are led by
quarterback Butch Butler,
and running back Larry Lane,
who rushed for 111 yards
against W&L.
