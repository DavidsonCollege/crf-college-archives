Hunger Awareness

By Jackie Carberry &
Mary Russ

As we sit in our rooms late at
night, studying for our big test,
munching on Doritos and slurping
asoda, it is often easy to forget the
plight of those less fortunate than
ourselves. Those who will never
see a bag of chips or a can of soda
for as longas they live. Those who
go for days, sometimes weeks-
without a bite to eat. Those who
leadamorbid, depressed life yearn-
ing for mere morsels of the suste-
nance we take for granted every-
day.

Anyone’ who participated in
the Oxfam Fast last November got
a taste of the bitter yearning that
hunger can inflict. For us, how-
ever, it was an experiment. For
others, itis a way of life. Statistics

report that 20 million Americans
gohungry every day. Many of the
hungry are also without homes.
According to the National Student
Campaign Against Hunger &
Homeless, we produce enough
food to feed everyone in the world.
Yet, one person dies from hunger-
related causes every forty seconds.

If any of these statistics have
disturbed or moved you at all; per-
haps it is time for you to take
action. On Saturday, April 13th,
the Hunger Awareness Committee
of the YSSC will be sponsoring
Davidson’s First Annual Hunger
Cleanup. Part of a nationwide ef-
fort, we'll be joining over 500 other
schools across the country to fight

hunger and homelessness while

_| Rape Awareness
Holds Campus Forum

By Frances Morton

On Tuesday, April 2, the Rape
Concerns Committee presented a
forum on Campus Rape. The com-
mittee presented a film followed
by a candid discussion of rape on
the Davidson campus.

The Rape Concerns:Commit-
tee, founded last year as a subcom-
mittee of the Women’s Concerns
Committee, was begun because
some of its members felt that the
issue was not receiving the atten-
tion it needed on campus. They
have been successful in addressing
this important issue and have got-
ten people talking by speaking to
first year students, the eating
houses, and other interested groups.

Sara Carlson and Rob Kelley,

members of the committee, hosted
the presentation. Kelly joined the
group after a friend came to him
seeking comfort after being ac-
costed and he realized how help-
less he was to help her. Carlson
also knows» several people on
campus who have been raped and
would like to increase awareness.

The film, hosted by Susan Dey
and Corbin Bernsen, consisted of
four interviews with college
women who had been raped. Two
of the women had been accosted
by strangers, the other two by men
they knew and had initially trusted.
One out of every six women on the
average college campus will have
been raped or found themselves a
victim of attempted rape before

Robertson Speaks On
Non-Coital Reproduction

By George Lafaye

Dr. John Robertson, professor
of law at the University of Texas at
Austin, spoke at Davidson on
Thursday, April 5. The topic of his
discussion was the legal and ethi-
calaspects ofnon-coital reproduc-
tion. He spoke about such specific
methods as in vitro fertilization,
embryo freezing, and the use of
surrogate mothers.

The lecture was part of a con-
tinuing series of lectures by: the
Medical Humanities program, with
support from the Area Health Edu-
cation Center of the Carolina’s
Medical Center.

Dr. Robertson began with
what he considers to be the consti-
tutional right to procreative free-
dom: the right to have babies is the
corollary to the right not to have
one, as expressed in the Supreme
Court decision Roe v. Wade.

He believes that persons who
are allowed to procreate sexually
should be allowed to utilize what-
ever technology they can afford to
have a baby.

Concerning this last point, Dr.
Robertson emphasized that access

to this technology would be lim- -

ited by a person’s ability to pay.
He compared this to other rights
saying, “I have the right to go to
Washington and petition the gov-
ernment, but that doesn’t mean I
have the right to have the govern-
ment pay for my plane ticket.”

He continued his talk by look-
ing at different methods for non-
coital reproduction and the spe-
cific legal and ethical issues asso-
ciated with each.

First, he reviewed in vitro fer-
tilization which is used in women
with blocked fallopian tubes. Many
ethical issues arise from this
method because ten or more eggs
are fertilized in order to increase
chances of bringing one to term.

Parts of the anti-abortion
movement believe that it would be
wrong to deny any of these eggs
the opportunity to go to term, but
that is often medically impossible
toimplantall the embryos because
of the risk of dangerous multiple —

births.

‘Dr. Robertson answers this by
saying, “All experts agree that an
embryo is nota person andas such
does not have rights or interests.”
Thus, the state would have noright
to intervene on the behalf of an
embryo to keep it from being al-
lowed to deteriorate.

One of science’s answers to

the questions of extra embryos is

to freeze them. Therefore, if the
initial attempt at fertilization fails,
a later attempt can be made. This
would be done without the initial
hormone therapy and surgery nec-
essary for the first stage of in vitro
fertilization.

For Dr. Robertson this is a
useful technology which “should
be permitted,” but he recognizes

they graduate. Most rapes that oc-
curoncollegé Campuses are in fact
committed by someone the victim
knows. Acquaintance rape usu-
ally takes place when drinking is
involved, and is just as wrong and
illegal as rape by a complete
stranger.

One of the colleges mentioned
in the film was much like Davidson
-- a small, but fairly well known
liberal arts college. The woman
was on a double date, but did not
want to call attention to her date’s
advances for fear of “causing waves
with the group or embarrassing
him.” As Dey put it, better a few
moments of social awkwardness

the need to formulate stronger
agreements between the two par-
ties before freezing begins.

The necessity for this was il-
lustrated in.the recent Tennessee
case, Davis v. Davis. In this case,
a divorcing couple fought over
several frozenembryos. -

The woman wanted them
implanted, but the man did not
want to have children from this
broken marriage. Although the
case is still under appeal, Dr.
Robertson suggested a way of
dealing with this and similar cases.

The prime consideration
should be who would be hurt most
by a decision against one or the
other. For instance, if the woman
