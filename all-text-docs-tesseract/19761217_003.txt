Landlord Sadler disgusts tenants”

By PHILIP DUNCAN
Assistant News Editor
Some Davidson students
renting off-campus houses
from town businessman Wil-
‘son Sadler complain that the
-landlord ignores or. reacts
. Slowly to their complaints and
grievances.
“I don’t want to paint
' Wilson up to. be a demon—he
isn’t an evil man—but he is
: chronically slow .in answering
- complaints about things that
. 80 wrong in his houses,” said
- Mark. Armstrong.

Sadler declines comment

: Armstrong, a senior, lives
- with a group of students in a
: Sadler house on Potts Street
: ‘He has rented from Sadler for
° three years and can recount
“ many of his and other renters’
problems.

“One time our commode
broke down, and for three
straight days we went by
- Wilson’s office asking him to
fix it. By the time he got
- around to it, the house smelled
"so bad you could hardly walk
in the door.
~ ‘'For awhile there was a hole
in the roof so big that we
collected ice chests full of
water that leaked in during a
hard rain. Wilson eventually
repaired the hole.”’

Bob Grizzard, another se-

SGA special committee to determine

nior who shares the Potts St.
house, tells this story:

“The back door on the house
wasn't too sturdy, and we
asked. Wilson in September,
1975, to put on a storm door
for.added protection against a
break-in. He stalled all
through the winter, told us
something about the storm
door warping if he put it on,
and when the school year
ended nothing had been done.

“Before I left for vacation, I
told him, ‘Wilson, I’ll pay for
the door if you’ll put it on.’
When I came back this fall—
no door.

“I asked him why he hadn't
done anything about it over

.the summer, and he told me

that he just wanted to be sure
that I’d pay for the door before
he put it up,’’ continued
Grizzard.

Speaks from experience

“‘He delayed further, and
one day someone broke in the

. house and stole my bicycle.”’

“‘Later that week Wilson
said that he was ready to put
up the door. I said, ‘Forget it,
bud, you’re too late.’

“It took us two years to get
storm windows put up, and
now our oven door doesn’t
work right—who knows when
that will be fixed?’’ said
Grizzard.

A girl who rents with three
others from Sadler, said, ‘‘We
used to have two bathrooms in
the house, but Wilson’s work-
men came in the other. day and
took one of them out. He put
in a vanity-type thing in-
stead—it’s pretty nice, but
we'd really rather have two
bathrooms. And he didn’t tell
us anything about taking it
out in the first place.

“There’s something wrong
with our furnace,”’ she added.
“In six weeks, it used around
400 gallons of oil.

“T talked with someone else
who has a house about the size
of ours, and he said he used
about 100 gallons of heating
oil in six weeks.

‘“We figured that we were
spending almost five dollars a
day to heat the house. And the
sad thing is, even with all that
oil, we couldn’t keep the house
really comfortable,’’ she said.

“I asked Wilson if five
dollars a day wasn’t a lot to
heat the house, and he said
that it didn’t seem like a whole
lot.

“Only one person can un-
lock our front door— Wilson
Sadler. It’s warped or some-
thing, and.none of us have

ever been able to unlock the
thing from the outside.

“Wilson came by one day,
worked with the key in the
door for about 15 minutes, and
finally opened it, but I have no
idea how he did it.”

Bicycle stolen

Rick Rauck and Ron Can-
non arranged last spring to
rent a house that Sadler was
remodeling.

“We came back in Septem-
ber to find the house was
nowhere near finished,’’ said
Rauck.

‘‘We went by his office
every day for a few weeks to
check on how the house was
going. After awhile we got
tired of the hassle and dropped
by two or three times a week
to remind Wilson that we were
still around.’

Sadler finally finished the:
house at the end of October.
Rauck and Cannon moved in
November 1, two months be-
hind schedule.

‘“We don’t have any com-
plaints now— Wilson did a
great job fixing the house—
but it was a lot of trouble
arranging alternate living
plans with Scotty for two
months and moving our be-
longings around three or four
times.”’

Another complained that for

two student Media Board members

By DENNIS McLAWHORN
Staff Writer

A special committee of the
SGA has drawn up a process
for selecting the SGA’s two
remaining choices to serve on
Davidson’s first Media Board.

The SGA is allotted three
members on the nine-man
board, including one person
from the media, With Mat-
thew Covington, outgoing
Davidsonian editor, having
been previously chosen for
that position.

The Screening Committee,
devised by Hans Watford and
Percy Badham, will soon be-
gin gathering a list of nomin-
ations from the media, fac-
ulty; and administration, and

‘will call upon ‘any interested
students. who feel they: are
. qualified to fill out an appli-
cation, for the. office.

The committee will hold
interviews to judge the stu-
dents’ Knowledge of the me-
dia, and détéermine how they
stand’‘on the ‘ issues of censor-
ship, freedom of the press; “and
responsible journalisth:

The two'students who'are
‘chosen will work-with.Coving-
ton,.as well as with the two
members; selected: by. the, ad-
‘ministration. The ,one..picked
. by, the faculty. and-the..three
; remaining; members~whd, will
* be chosen by those six. ee

TheMedia Board} formu-
* lated under, Article:X} -of the
: Constitution, will have” absol-
ute power over :the college
media:...The --Davidsenian,

@

Quips and Cranks, Miscel-
lany, WDAV, and the Wildcat
Handbook. Its controls will
include the power to appoint
and remove editors, the power
of censorship, as well as
financial control.

Jeff Sich, Chairman of the
Media Board Screening Com-
mittee, is wary of the fact that
most students do not realize
the implications of this cen-
tralized control.

“‘T think one of the things
that the members of the
Screening Committee are real-
ly concerned about is that

‘there won’t.be enough interest

in the Media Board,’ he said.
“Besides screening candi-
dates, I think that we see one
of our functions as to stimu-

late students’ interest in the
Media Board and their aware-
ness of how important the
Media Board will be to conti-
nued success and growth of
the Davidson media.

“Two years ago, when the
talk about the Media Board
began, I really felt threatened,

and I still feel that every’

student here at Davidson
should be concerned about the
restrictions and the limita-
tions that may be imposed
upon the media, even to the

point of volunteering to serve «

on the Media Board,’’ he
added.

“It’s going to be the func-
tion of the first Media Board
to devise standards of respon-
sible journalism, and we hope

?Merry Christmas
from

Everyone at the

(Peregrine House.

that a student whose inter-
ested in serving on the. Media
Board will have at least
thought all this through and
will have come to some conclu-
sions concerning what he feels
is responsible journalism,” he
explained.

The Screening Committee

has set a deadline of January
14 for applications to be
turned in. The final recom-
mendations will be made to
the SGA on January 25.

some ‘tine his house was
without a workable shower. A
number said Sadler had never
given them a copy of their
lease.

All of the tenants inter-
viewed said that Sadler’s ren-
tal rates and payment policies
were reasonable.

“Rent is due at the first of
each month, and we have a
ten-day grace period. He’s
never pressured us at all,’’
said Armstrong.

‘‘Maybe he figures that
since he’s so easygoing in
collecting the rent he can
correspondingly drag his feet
when things need to be re-
paired,’’ he suggested.

House unfinished

The Davidsonian attempted
to interview Sadler on five
separate occasions during a
span of two weeks. Each time
Sadler was unavailable or too |
busy to answer questions.

He made one brief com-
ment:‘‘If any of my tenants
have any complaints, I wish
they’d come talk to me.”’
When informed that many of
his tenants claimed they had
come to him with their prob-
lems, but had found little
satisfaction of their grievan-
ees, Sadler said, ‘‘I don’t want
to say anything in a public
forum.”’
