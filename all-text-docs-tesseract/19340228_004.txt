SPRING SPORTS
BEGIN SOON

If “Three and Two” were legal in
the township, we might put a bit of
real spirit into the old toast, “Here's
to spring, just around the corner, and

a farewell to Old Man Winter.” The
days are getting longer, now, and the
boys in the lighter clads are getting
out and under way. It won't be long
until the start of the spring sports.

We owe a hand to‘ the boys of
the cinderpath, by the way. That
was a splendid showing the Wild-
cat representatives made in the
West Virginia Indoor Meet re-
cently. They will have another
chance to repeat their success soon,
when the Carolina Indoor Meet is
run off on March 10 in Chapel
Hill.

Captain Pritchett is looking forward
to a most successful season this year,
with possible prospects of a perfect
record. With Frazier, Merchant, and
Oakes in the distances, Cochran in the
weights, and Evans and Faison in the
dashes, he has the foundation for a
fine team. We of the common people
are all for the lads,

When the copy for this column
went to press, the results of the
1 Fl g Five had
not yet been made public, but at
the last report, Davidson’s entry,
Johnny .Mackorell, was still well
in the running, and was slightly
in the lead of Earl Clary, South
Carolina’s entry. The other win-
ners in this contest will probably
be Crawford of Duke, Barclay and
Weathers of Carolina, and Stassa-
vitch of Lenoir-Rhyne.

Davidson will have a glimpe of some
of her future athletes Saturday when
the boys from Barium Springs come
to town.and the Wildcats entertain at
the annual Barium Springs Day. That's
a fine bunch of lads, with the makings
of real Davidson men. Hope we see
more of them in the future. The Ba-
rium boys who have attended David-
son have always made a nice showing
in their athletic ventures while they
were here.

Saturday will also see the end
of the spring football training pe-
riod, when the Reds and the Blacks
meet in a full length game. Boy,
what a team we ought to have
next year! I for one would surely
like, to go up to see the West
Pointers try to put something over
on the Wildcats. It would be fine
if Davidson could take a cheering |,
section up to help out the team.
Why not?

If you have happened over to the
gym lately, you may have seen -any
number of-“daring’young “men on the
flying trapeze.” No, it was only the
boys entered in the annual gymnastic
competition. Last year this contest
was won by Lacy Adcox. There is
some pretty stiff competition this year,
from all reports, and the contest waxes
warm,

Too bad the grapplers had to
cancel their meet scheduled for
Saturday night. There seems to
be a concensus of opinion that the
Wildcat wrestlers would have put
up a pretty good fight, and the
result probably would have been
hard.to foretell. I haven't quite
gotten over the way the Davidson
lads handled themselves against a
stronger team last Friday week.
In a line, with the winter sports,

those boys from South Carolina surely
deserve a word on their really remark-
able showing against three of the
strongest quints in the Southern Con-
ference, and on successive nights, to
make it all the harder. Those Birds
seem to be gluttons for punishment.
Almost foolish at times, say we. They
seem to be ably equipped to take it,
though. We'd like to be Present at
the Southern Conference run-off Fri-
day and Saturday of this week!

While we are on the subject of
basketball, the Wildcat cagers

gh to ° lations, ana
in other cases congratulations, on

their showings for the season.

The varsity has had a bit of tough

luck. Better luck next year, ’Cats.

did material coming up from the

Davidson Loses to S. C. Team,
32-23, as Season Ends

LAFFERTY IS STAR

“Swan Song” for Holland and
Lafferty

The Davidson Wildcats, playing their
last game of the season, were defeated
by the Flying Fleet from Erskine,
32-23, in a hard fought game here last
Friday.

The game was close, especially dur-
ing the second half, with the locals
leading 18-17 at one time. The score

at the half was 15-12 in favor. of
Erskine.
Baker, Erskine forward, was high

point man for the night, scoring five
field goals and one free shot for a
total of eleven, points. For the Wild-
cats, Lafferty played best, chalking up
seven points.

This game spelled finis to the college
basketball careers of two men—Laff-
erty, forward, and Holland, guard. All
other players have one or more years
to their credit.

The refree for the game was Mc-
Cachren, of the Charlotte Y.

Line-up:
Dav. (23) Posi. Erskine (32)
Harris (6) R.F. Baker (11)
Lafferty (7) LF. S. Miller (4)
Ross (4) Center Bolton (5)
Holland (1) RG. Reid (5)

Passes, Kicks, and New Plays
Feature Scrimmage

In a scrimmage featured with re-
verse kicks and passes, the Reds and
Blacks fought to a 13-13 tie here Sat-
urday on Richardso»- Field. « The two
teams put up an airtight defense and
took advantage of every break that
offered itself, but to no avail as far as
a victory was concerned.

Wingfield and Mackorell led the
Reds and were responsible for their
two, touchdowns, while Johnny Pearce
put over both counters for the Blacks.
Wingfield was transferred to the Red
team due to the fact that two mem-
bers of that team, Garrison and Yar-
borough, had to drop out because of
injuries. He and Mackorell exhibited
a fine brand of football and should
cause trouble for more than one team
this fall. Pearce proved the most elu-
sive ball carrier on the field Saturday
and is another likely candidate for the
backfield next year.

Paul Pittman created quite a sen-
sation in the game when he, on re-
ceiving a punt, immediately booted the
ball back to the onrushing Red team,
who were caught unprepared. The ex-
change of kicks, which netted the
Blacks several yards, took on a humor-
ous aspect as twenty-two men rushed
back and forth in a desperate attempt
to down the ball,

Another feature of the contest was
a lateral pass which so completely baf-
fled the opposing team that a substan-
tial gain was made practically every
time. Other new deceptive plays in-
troduced by Newton and McEver were
used in the game to an advantage.

In the past four weeks of football
Practice the coaches have spent much
of their time on blocking and in teach-
ing the men new plays. However,
Coach Newton especially stressed the
need for cadence and precision in exe-
cuting these plays, and by next year
he hopes to have a team well instilled
in these points.

Freshman Cindermen
List Hard Opponents

After a fairly successful season in
cross-country, and showing signs of

meets.

The schedule is as follows:

March 24—High Point High, at Da-

strong varsity tennis team this year,
two extensive trips to the North and
South have been arranged, Manager
“Wee” Thompson announced.
The team will leave for Gainesville,
Fla., on March 29th, during the spring
holidays, where Davidson will engage

Athletic Fraternity
Holds Meeting Tues.

Annual Picture and Initiation of
Men Discussed

A discussion of the taking in of new
members was the object of the recent
meeting of Sigma Delta Psi, national
honorary athletic fraternity, held last
Tuesday, February 20,

A discussion was also brought up at
this meeting as to whether or not the
fraternity would have its pictures in
the Annual, It was decided that they
would delay the discussion of this ques-
tion until after the initiation of the new
members, when’ another session will
be called.

Interest is growing at this time in
the passing of tests for entrance into
the society. All members of the stu-
dent body are eligible to try out, and
it is possible to pass off the tests in
one year, tests which cover most of

Reds And Blacks To
End Spring Practice

Saturday, March 3, will be “ Barium
Springs Day” here at Davidson and the
Reds will meet the Blacks in the final
game of the winter football practice.
The game is to be of full length and
will have all the aspects of a real con-
test. :

The Reds will have such men as
Mackorell, Wingfield, “Swede” John-
son, Burns, Newton, Siewers, Hand,
Lee, Dickson, Brewer, Koenig, Mc-
Clung and Patterson, while the Blacks
will have Verble, Pittman, Pearce,
Carlson, Cathey, Johnston, Dick John-
son, Young and Gracey.

The teams will be fighting for su-
premacy in the winter football ses-
sion, and also because it means a lot
to the individual players. The squad
has been divided long enough for the
men on each side to get a group spirit.
Rivalries between the players have also
been developed and Saturday's contest
points to a close game. So far the
two teams have played three contests.
The Blacks won. the first 6-0 and the
last two have resulted in ties, indicat-
ing the evenness of the squads.

The proceeds from the game are to
be given to the Barium Springs loan
fund. The movement was started by
Davidson alumni, and is being handled
by them. The money will enable’ stu-
dents at the orphanage to attend col-
lege,

In addition to the football game, a
program by the Barium children is
being planned, and some of them will
appear at the regular chapel period at
Davidson Saturday. All of the Barium
Springs students will be brought to
Davidson for the afternoon and will
be guests of the college while they are
here.

Intramural Fighters
Hold Annual Contest

Thirty Men Expected to Compete
in Contest

The annual Davidson intramural
boxing tournament is scheduled to
start tomorrow, March 1, and will last
through March 3, The first two days
of the tournament will be given over
to the preliminaries, while the finals
will take place on the last day.

Around thirty men are expected to
enter the contest and boxers of the
different weights will compete with
others in their own class. The men
will enter one of the following classes,
namely: welterweight, lightweight,
middleweight, and heavyweight. Al-
though last year’s tournament was
fought for class standing only, the win-
ners of the contest this year will be
rewarded with medals,

For the past several weeks boxing
classes under the direction of Captain
Norton Pritchett have been conducted,
and the men are in good shape for the
bouts. In order to avoid congestion
on the main floor of the gymnasium,
the classes were held upstairs at 5
o'clock cach week day except on Sat-
urdays,” However, any and all students
are invited to come out, whether they

have been members of this class or
not.

END FINE SEASON

Freshman Team Defeated 24-20
by Boiling Springs

The freshman basketball team of
Davidson College has just completed
its 1934 schedule with a rather suc-
cessful week, recording one loss and
two victories to climax a somewhat
brilliant season,

The Centennials met the Boiling
Springs team last Tuesday, February
20, at Boiling Springs. Although Pea-
body rang up ten points for the frosh,
the boys from .Boiling Springs were
too much for the Davidson aggrega-
tion and the visitors heard the final
whistle as they were still at the losing
end of a 24-20 score. Mauney, flash
center for the opposition, scored 12
points for the winners, being high
scorer of the game. Boiling Springs
led at the half, 12-11.

On their home court Friday, Febru-

scoring with a total of 14 points, while

credit. Porter, Davidson forward, and

and well played, the deciding factor
being the physical condition of the
players.

The faculty swung into an early
lead which they kept throughout the
first half, although the varsity kept the
lead slim at times. They continued
the pace for part of the third quar-
ter, when the varsity gained the lead
and kept it the rest of the game,

Both teams were handicapped some-
what in not having one qf. their stars
playing. Peabody was unable to play
for the faculty and Lafferty and Mor-
gan were absent from the varsity line-
up.
