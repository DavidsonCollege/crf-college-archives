The Tech game is the one Davidson |
would rather lose than any other, but it |

win,

Tech, from 1915 through 1920 played
52 games, won 45, lost 5, and tied 2. Her}
total score for the 52 was 2;265 points |
against 142 for her opponents.

Wake Forest hasn’t won a game yet.
Keep up the pep. We don't want them
to until after next Saturday. It is hard
to get a line on Wake Forest through
comparative scores. They held Tech to
2 points, but they did the same thing
last year, an although their score against
the Engineers was lower than David-
son’s, the Wildcats won by three touch-
downs.

—Wildcats——

Coach Black’s All-Americans certainly
are the stuff. They held Monroe to a
tie, although the Monroe team averaged
as much as our Varsity. The other All-
American squad uncorked
over the strong Shelby High team.

record:

Wake Forest 7, Davidson 27.

This is the opinion of the Atlanta Jour-

This year Wake Forest has met V. M.

lina was also able to gain 21 points.

From this it is evident that the scrap
Saturday will be a snappy one.

DEFEAT CHARLOTTE HIGHS

The Davidson High School Wildkit-
tens hooked up with the Charlotte lads
last Saturday, and when the final
whistle blew, the Wildkittens had mauled |
and clawed their way to an overwhelm- |
ing victory, letting down the Charlotte
lads at the small end of a 46 to o score.

Charlotte receives the kick-off and ran
it back ten yards, and then made first
down on long end run to mid-field, They
failed to gain, Their punt was blocked
but they recovered and penalized five |
yards for off side. They punted and on
the first play, Wells, Davidson’s left half,
ran around left end sixty-five yards for |
a touchdown. Gray kicked goal. |

After that Charlotte never threatened |
to score and the ball was in Davidson's |
possession most of the time. The game
was spectacular for the long runs by |
Davidson, and Grey's kick-offs. The long- |
est run of the day was made by Grey, |
who ran back a punt seventy yards for a
touchdown. Wells contributed to the
score by making three touchdowns after

runs of sixty-five, forty and forty yards.

He made another run for thirty yards.
Thompson and Arbuckle also pulled off
some long runs of from twenty to thirty |
yards. The other touchdowns were as|
follows: Grey 2; Arbuckle 1; and Riggs
McConnell who caught a twenty yard
pass from Grey and ran five yards for a
touchdown, 1. Grey kicked three goals
after touchdown. Joe McConnell start-
ed in the line for Davidson. Greer, Cra-
ver, and Elms did some fine playing for
Charlotte.

PHI SOCIETY ARGUES WEST |
VIRGINIA MINERS’ STRIKE

The regular meeting of the Phi Soci-
ety was held last Thursday night and
was full of pep and interesting.

The first gentleman on the affirmative, |
Wooten, announced the subject as, “Re-|
solved, that the West Virginia Miners
were justified in striking. Wooten then |
gave a brief history of the present
trouble, bringing out facts in proof of
the justifiability of their actions. His}
Mr. McGirt, showed that the}
operators were breaking the laws much |
more than were the miners. For the!
negative, Russell and Brown |
argued that the miners were not in any
way justified in the means they used to
obtain their end, and therefore the end}
was not under these conditions a worthy
The decision was unanimous for
the negative.

W. K. McCain delivered a very inter-
esting oration on actual conditions in
Mexico today. He gave a clear picture
of the impressions a visitor would get in
a Mexican city the size of Charlotte.

The regular program was closed with
an extemporaneous debate between Lacy
and: Wood on the quéstion: “Resolved, |

\

Jernhardt,

Senior |

The Philanthropic Fresh meeting Mon-|
day night was one of the livest so far,|
full of pep the whole time with lots of |
spirit and fight shown by the debaters. |
A great deal of enthusiasm was shown |
by several of the speakers, which proved |
to be contagious, spreading over the |
whole audience.

The subject was, Resolved, “That the
West Virginia Miners were justified in

'

{their recent uprising.”

Owing to the absence of three of the

debaters, Northrop, Roberts and Byerly,
substitutes were asked to fill their places, |

in response to which Holtshouser vol-

unteered to serve on the affirmative and
Austin and Ray on the negative.

The affirmative was led by Wharton,
who depicted the miners as being op-
pressed by the operators and rising to
throw off the oppression. His debate
was dignified and well thought out.

Smith led the negative and drew a
splendid picture of the numerous bene-
fits provided by the mine owner for the
miner. ’

The second speaker of the affirmative,
Thomas, presented the miner's. side. in
that the strike was the only, weapon the
miner had to use. Holtshouser com-
pleted the argument for the affirmative
and did much to tear down the points of
his opponents.

In an animated denunciation of the
miner and his treatment of the operator,
Austin greatly strengthened the defence
of the negative. He was followed by
Ray who summed up the arguments of
his colleagues.

The critic spoke well of the meeting
and commended the speakers for their
logical and well thought out debates, and

‘also on their delivery.

EU SOCIETY ADJOURNS IN
DEFERENCE TO REVIEWS

The regular meeting of the Eu society
was curtailed on account of reviews and
re-exams being at hand.

The-mecting was opened with a-prayer
by McGukin and Scripture reading by
the president. The roll was called and
the minutes read. The society decided
to change its hour of meeting from 7:15
to 7:30, since some of the members work
in the boarding houses and are unable to
be on time at the earlier hour.

Patterson announced that he was
ready to receive the money of any mem-
bers so inclined.

The society voted to adjourn on ac-
count of overhanging reviews and be-
cause of the absence of those on the
program. The society adjourned to meet
next Thursday at 7:30 p. m.
