Ticket policy continues to
g be challenged / defended

By GARY WHEELER

The college’s new ticket pol-
icy, which has come under
criticism by students, faculty
and staff, is not likely tochange
significantly any time this sea-
son.

Sterling Martin, Interim Di-
rector of Athletics, defended
the policy by explaining that it
was not formed hastily. “It is
not a thoughtless ticket pol-
icy,” he said. The existing pol-
icy was formed with the helpof
a ten-member student advi-
sory committee.

Martin wants to give the
policy some time before con-

' sidering any changes. “We'll

giveita shot,” he said, “if itjust
doesn’t ‘work we'll consider
changingit.” og.

The $10 and $12 ticket prices
for the public and the two-dol-
lar parking fee are seen as
measures that help keep the
athletic department more fi-
nancially independent.

Martin explained that
Davidson is committing itself
to Divison Iathleticsinall areas
other than football, and that
this commitment is expensive.
The athletic budgetis currently
about $2.2 million a year, a fig-
ure that amounts to a “fairly
high percentage” of the col-
lege’s total budget, Martin
said.

While Martin recognizes that
$2.2 million is large figure for a
school the size of Davidson, he
also says that it may not be
enough, especially with the

addition of women’s scholar-
ships. “It’s easy for [University
of North] Carolina to put an-
other million in its budget, but
it’s not for Davidson,” he said.
Selling tickets at a higher price
and selling the tickets that stu-
dents do not pick up the day
before the game “creates reve-
nue,” Martin added.

Tripp Helms, president of
the Student Government Asso-
ciation, said that the SGA will
look into the possiblity of set-
ting up a ticket table in Cham-
bers on game days. Helms said
that this would enable students
who do not go to Baker the day
before the game to easily get a
ticket until noon, and then re-
maining tickets could be sold
to the public at the complex.
