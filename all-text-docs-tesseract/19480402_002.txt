April's Fool?

April 1 has for many years been a day
on which we seek to amuse ourselves: by
describing things as they are not in reality.
This is a healthful practice—it helps us to
momentarily forget our troubles, to regain

the proper perspectives. Unfortunately, too
many of us are inclined to attempt to avoid
reality every day rather than solely on one
day each year, A very‘few seek to do so
adjust themselves to
challenging but these
“eseapists’’ we are not concerned. We should,

because they cannot
conditions, with
however, be very concerned about those who
do not have a ‘‘speaking acquaintance’? with
reality as a result of a lack of interest,

As was pointed out by Walter Mann in
editorial

an excellent some \Wweeks ago,

Davidson seems to be a’center of he

™m
not concerned’”’ school of thought. We ioe

admit that we are not situated in an area of \

intense activity, but there is ample oppor-
tunity for us te’keep abreast of the sitta-
tion existing in the world today if we are
willing to take advantage—of if, In_addition
to newspapers, magazines and the radio we
are frequently ‘exposed.’ to speakers who,
from experience, are able to bring us up to
date information about all the nations and
the peoples of the earth, Yet, how many
of us take advantage of these sources of
facts ?—far*too many of us confine our read-
ing to the comics and the spoerts-page-and
our chapel time to wanderings into the land
of dreams, As a result we often fail.to under-
stand what is going on around us—both on
the domestie and the foreign scene.

Many men seem to feel that only per-
sonal experience is valid—that nothing vital
can be learned from others, This belief, of
course, is fallacious. Problems can be thet
only when they arise but prior preparation
and knowledge are tremendous assets when
the hour of trial arrives, Davidson. was
established to serve, among other things, as
a source of. statistics about life—the pro-
fessors and the visiting speakers continually
endeaver to point these facts out to us, Still,
however, we often fail to take advantage of
their experience and study.

It is becoming more and more apparent
that we af Davidson cannot remain isolated.
The condition of the world today is too

‘

a

\

grave—the stakes are too high to be ignored.
Even if we do escape having to participate
in another ereat war in the near future, it
will not be long wuatil we will be called upon
to serve as leaders in our communities, states
and nation. We owe it
our fellow citizens to prepare now for those

to ourselves and to

positions of responsibility, No boxer would
attempt to fight for the championship with-
out a great deal of training—no man should
take upon himself the duties of citizenship
Without first making an effort to acquaint
himself with the problems which he will be

called upon to face and to solve,

Fortunately, it is rarely ever too late to

train for this struggle. Ifa man is to be a

valuable and a successful citizen, however,
he must continue to seek the truth about
the world’s problems as lone as he lives. Let
us endeavor to sqtare off with reality now
and to take our rightful places as leaders in
the years to come, If we fail, those who come

opinion that the facts which appeared in the
last issue of THE: DAVIDSONTAN about the
eandidates far the editorships of three stur

students have expressed

least. Those of tis who prepared them wilt be
the first to admit the validity of this eriti-
cism. The facts were, in our opinion, the only
ones whieh eould be presented to the student
body without violating the provisions of the
“anti-campaigning’? regulation whieh ap-
pears inthe sfident constitution, This pro-

Vision reads as follows:

SECITON 9=—ANct 1V.—"it shall be illegal
for any person, group, organization, club or
fraternity to solicit votes for a candidate for
office.”

We felt that the printing of statements
of poliey by the candidates might subject
the individual candidates and THE DAVID-
SONTAN to charges of haying violated the
above provision because if would be virtual-

seited eto the student body, Information
aboukall varieties of elections could ne doubt

Until certain changes are made by the
student body, it appears tht the campus
publications will be forced to omit all state-
ments of policy by individual candidates, If
the student body desires such information,
an amendment will have to be adopted mak-
ing such a practice “legal,”

- Editor's Note

Due to the necessity of devoting most of
Page Four to the information about the can-
diates for the various student body offices
we were forced to’ omit certain regular fea-
tutes—including the Operating Table. We re-

--gret that such action was necessary and we
assure you that this widely read article will
appear as usual in the next issue.

For the information and guidance of the
curious, your copy of THE DAVIDSONIAN
was delivered to your r6om tonight so that
you may be able to vote more intelligently
tomorrow. ‘It is the hope of the staff, the Stu-
dent Council, and the Elections Board that
the measure adopted to increase the voter’s
knowledge of the candidates will prove bene-
ficial to all, 3

1925 from the University of Chi-

his doctorate in linguistics, Before
that time Dr. Vowles was grad-
uated from Fargo, a Congregational
college in his home town in what
was, at his birth, Dakota territory.
For many Dr. Vowles was
a member of the faculty at his
alma‘mater and later served as as-

sistant to the president of the Uni-
versity of North Dakota,

In 1914 Dr. Vowles received his
master's degree from Oxford Uni-
versity, While on his honeymoon.
Previously he had spent three years

| at Oxford as a Rhodes scholar
\from North Dakota. It was during
{that period that Prof, Vowles

earned his bachelor’s degree.

After receiving his M.A., Dr. and
Mrs. Vowles went into Europe and
Berlin at the outbreak of
| World War I. With much dif-
ficulty they returned America
| by immigrant steerage in an Eng-
| lish ship. i

Dr. Vowles states sincerely that
he considers himself fortunate to
be a member of the Davidson
faculty and that Mrs. Vowles joins
him in that sentiment.

For two summers Dr, Vowles
has been guest professor at the
University of North Carolina and
at Duke University. Much of his
time outside of teaching spent
working on his lawn and keeping
up in linguistics and
German literature.

(Continued From Page Four)

The Student Council, Elections
Board, and Nominating Committee,
meeting in joint session Wednes-
day night voted to adopt the Elee-
tions Information Plan, minus the
statement-of_ ideas by the candidate.
There are some risks in any ven-
ture, disadvantages to any plan, but
it is certainly often “far wiser to
act than to hesitate.” Our sincere
thanks to these for their
action.

For the next two weeks we
will be nominating and electing
officers for our student govern-
ment, YMCA, publications,
classes, etc. The majority of us
as voters still will not know as
much as we would like to know
about the men we vote for.
However this year, we will have
some facts about every candi-
date upon which to base our
judgment. A candle may not be
a searchlight, but it is better
then pitch darkness.

Now its up to each of us to vote,
and to use the printed information.

Wednesday morning when we real-
ized that we were to hear the fa-
mous Southern-air ace and author
of “God Is My Co-Pilot.” Truely
“something is ‘wrong with our
world” when we have to fight every
few years. But, as he said, we

blind enough to underestimate any
potential enemy.
PRAY FOR PEACE

President Cunningham's message
to the Southern Presbyterian
Chureh-at Easter, calling-on-Chris-
tians to pray for peace, was most
timely. Surely God could work &
miracle and restore both freedom
and peace, but our people are not
looking to Him. Now is the hour
to pray for peace.
ARM SPAIN? ;

Our House of Representatives
made what we would call a very
foolish and short-sighted move this
week. in voting to include Fascist
Spain, ally to Hitler to the end, in
our European aid program, When
Fascism threatened to conquer. the
world, we armed Russia, and now
are threatened by a power our own
aid helped to build. Shall we now
arm Spain, Argentine, and Ger-
many, only to have them turn on
us again. Or are we really intelli-
gent enough to know that it is the
IDEA of dictatorial tyranny that
we must fight, no mattér what its
name tag,\ whether it be Nazi,
Communist, Roman Catholic, Em-
peror Worship or what have you.

“D” DAYS

It is interesting to note that the
weather man is again smiling on the
ROTC department. Two out of
four’ dry Tuesdays this semester
were in March. Most of our ’Fues-
day afternoon drill periods have

hail

been spent wading around “the D.”
