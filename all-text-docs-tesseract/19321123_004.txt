THE DAVIDSONIAN, NOVEMBER 23, 1932

Alumni News

THE VOICE OF AN ALUMNUS
There’s a song that rings in my-ears tonight,
That echoes in vague refrain,

The song on the campus, ‘neath moonbeams
bright,

When the students roam, on a summer night,

That makes me yearn for the sweet delight

Of those bygone days again.

Back to the soft cool evening’s breath,
Back from the city’s heat,
Back just to stride

On the campus wide,

And the dear old friends to meet.

How often I’ve set my noisy alarm
To rise quite in time for math,
Where the flunker sits in blank dismay,
And waking, found that cuts, I say,
Shall be given to him that hath.

Back to the same old haunts again,
Back to the student flock,

Back to my books

And the stern Prof’s looks,

College—and my faithful clock.
—S. N. WHITNEY.

alumnus who has graduated from Davidson
less than five years ago sent in $3.00 he was
considered a paid up member and entitled to

Mr. Dwight Chalmers
Gives Final Address

In the concluding morning devotional pe-
riod of the series of services Conducted by
Mr. Dwight M. Chalmers, the memorable
words of Paul, “I know whom I have be-
lieved, and am persuaded that he is able to
keep that which I have committed unto him
against that day,” were used as a text.

Mr.

experience

Every person, asserted Chalmers,
should have a_ personal with
Christ, in order that Christ should become
real to him. No amount of teaching or be-
lieving is equal to a personal experience.
Many who have heard and read of Jesus
Christ have become hardened and indifferent
to Him, and think that He is not a reality,
chiefly. because of the lack of a personal
contact. However, it is much easier for
us to know Him today than it was in the
days of the apostles, because our vision is
made clearer by the perspective of nineteen
centuries.

Mr. Chalmers cited a letter, written dur-
ing the first days of our American Republic,
in opposition to President Washington. The
author of the letter reviled the, President in
every possible way. The author was so close
to Washington that he could not‘see the true
greatness of the man. So the apostles were
so close to Him that they could not see
clearly His every move, Their chief error
was in anticipating His Kingdom as a’ tem-
poral kingdom.

Paul said, “I know whom I have. believed,”
when there was no church, no New Testa-
ment or Creed. The fact remains that he
knew Christ because he established personal
and gave himself over to Christ.
How easy it should be today to. know Christ,
since He is in the center of life, while in
Paul’s day, He was known by a very few
people. In order to really know Christ,
we must find Him for ourselves; we must
not let any outside influences interfere with
our ‘faith, and finally we must give our-
selves completely over to Him.

Wednesday, Nov. 23—The Phantom of
Crestwood—(RKO)

Here is*the last chapter of. that thrilling
mystery that has been broadcast by Na-
tional Broadcasting Corporation week by
week. But the final chapter turns out to be
not so exciting as might be expected. N. B. C.
and R K O are both subsidies of the Radio
Corporation of America —and—this—unique
method of advertising seems to have been
very successful.

Jenny Wren (Karen Morley). is murdered
at a house party and at first it seems quite
easy to guess who is guilty, but as. motives
are examined more and more, suspects be-
come evident. The ending is most unex-
pected.

Most of the old means of creating an eerie
atmosphere and some new ones (phos-
phorescent death masks, etc.) are used to
good advantage.

Thursday, Nov. 24—Trouble in Paradise—
(Paramount)

Director Ernst Lubitsch again produces
one of the gems of cinema, Contrary to his
custom, there are no songs in this picture;
nevertheless it possesses that same indescrib-
able sparkle of sophistication and finish
characteristic of this director.

The story is about a super-crook and his
inamorata (Herbert
Hopkins), who set out to rob a rich Parisian
widow (Kay Francis), who very obligingly
falls in love with the crook.

The interior decoration in.the sets of Hans
Drier has many a charming innovation.

Friday, Nov. 25—He Learned About Women

Stuart Erwin plays in that vein in which
he is perhaps the most adept of stars, the
art of appearing befuddled, while Alison
Skipworth and Susan Fleming lend even
more*humor to the situation. :

Saturday, Nov, 26—Hell’s Highway—( RKO)
Another picture exposing the horror and
brutality of the chaingang in full detail.
Richard Dix stars and does perhaps his
best job of acting since “Cimarron”; very
spectacular at points.

Monday, Nov. 28—Faithless—( M-G-M_)

Tallulah Bankhégd plays a slightly more
vivacious role and has a decidedly, better
leading man than-usual. The picture suffers
from a rather trite and complicated plot.

The story is concerned with the disaster
which befalls the rich after the crash: After
a maze of complications, Robert Montgom-
ery and Tallulah Bankhead’ are finally re-
united.

Tuesday, Nov. 29—Mask of Fu Manchu
A genuine thriller following the story
which appeared recently. “
Joris Karloff as Fu Manchu and Myrna
Loy as his daughter are outstanding. They
are excellently supported by a very .capable

cast.

UNION THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY

Richmond, Virginia
B. R. Lacy, Jr., D.D., LL.D., President

A graduate of Davidson and of Union studying abroad writes:

“There are‘able, scholars here

whose books are known and read

all over the religious world. None of them can surpass some of our
professors at Union as teachers, and none of them can challenge a
student to joyous, practical Christianity as did our professors there.”

Marshall and Miriam,

Josephus—Lion Feuchtwanger. Viking Press.

The biography of a vacillating, scheming
office seeker must never present the hero
as a man worthy of admiration. In this
respect Feuchtwanger has done his subject
justice—in fact more than justice. The au-
thor has taken it upon himself to’ portray
ten short years in the life of a man about
whom_—very—little_historical_fact_is known.
The portions lacking are generously supplied
from the writer’s imagination.
would-be biography degenerates into a: his-
torical novel.

However, this work clearly shows how
far the modern historical novel has wandered
from the form used by -Scott. The facts
have not been shifted and warped to suit
the trend of the story. Instead they have
been carefully subordinated and subdued to
a lifeless drabness which causes the hero
to glitter and glow like the diamond in a
gambler’s stick pin; the chief character
seems to be at least a demi-god without
whose sanction and tender care history
would have-died- in infancy.

But back to the book again. The work

loses in strength and interest to an extent|

because of the superabundance of needless
characters. Each page sees its groups of
new people who ooze into the story, have
nothing to do with its progress or its hero,
and who,pass out of the field of action in
the next two or three pages. Along with
this constant ingress and egress of foreign-
ers, a rather complete history of Titus and
Vespasian, of Dame Bernie, and of Simon
Bar Giora is given in installments. ~This at
times ‘creates such a state of milling con-
fusion in the mind of the reader that he al-
most is forced to abandon. the book in sheer
exhaustion.

The final failure is that the best portions |~

of the novel have little or no direct influ-
ence on Josephus. And though this is a

Thus the} of rebellion leap up from Jerusalem. Strong,

failure as far as Josephus is concerned, it
is the only thing that saves the book and
makes it worth reading. The very magic
of Feuchtwanger’s words produces a sense
of intimate contact with the Roman and
Jewish world. One is jostled and shoved by
ragamuffins in the Circus as they sing, “Who
is the master here? Who pays for the but-
ter?”

; As the book nears its close, Herr Feuch-
twanger reaches his height. By skillful
artistry, he gradually fans into flame the
Jewish ~Roman-— hatred—-which has been
smouldering throuhgout the book. The fires

methodical Rome sends out her stern, in-
exorable armies to subdue the insolent
province. Jerusalem is doomed. Wall after
wall falls before the relentless battering
rams. The Jewish garrison retreats, all the
while desperately trying to stem the metallic
tide of destruction. Only the temple re-
mains. Then the hot flood of Roman hatred
engulfed the walls, burned the temple to
the ground and left Jerusalem the golden
as a heap of glowing ashes.

In fact the whole. book is exceedingly in-
teresting and enjoyable as long as it is not
considered a biography of Josephus.
