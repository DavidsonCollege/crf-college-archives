Court may impose cover charge

Independents to suffer consequences of PCC decision

By MatrTHEWw EirIcu
Assistant News Editor

Just like fraternity and eating
house members, independents next
year will have to pay what amounts
to a social fee to attend Court par-
ties. The plan to charge indepen-
dents was introduced ata Patterson
Court Council (PCC) meeting be-
fore break and is far from final-
ized.

U.S. team

Once again, the eyes of the

soccer world will turn toward
Davidson.

WOMEN'S

SOCCER

Friday afternoon, Davidson
announced the defending world
champion U.S. women’s national
soccer team will play Finland here
Sunday, April 30 at 2 p.m.

The game is the second in a
five-game series dubbed “The
Road to Sweden” that the U.S.
team is embarking on to prepare
for its June defense of its world
title in Sweden.

The squad will play in Atlanta
and Davidson before traveling to
California for two games and then
to Alberta, Canada for one game.

For Davidson, the game marks
another in what is becoming a long
line of high-profile soccer games.
And it is believed to be the first
time world champions have played
at Davidson. ;

“We’re excited that the U.S.
Soccer Federation chose Atlanta
and Davidson for their final East
Coast appearances [before the
World Championships],” says
Game Management Director Lee
Sargent, who spearheaded the ef-
fort to have Davidson host the

Patterson Court Advisor Kurt
Holmes and PCC President Steven
Shames both acknowledge three
pressing issues for the change in
policy.

“Court Membership”

At a Court party, not all the
funds are liquidated. Risk man-
agement also is a very important
and necessary component of any
gig. In the past the Dean of Stu-
dents Office paid for the police

officers and risk managers, but this
endeavor has become too costly
for a single office to bear. Accord-
ing to Holmes, paying for the risk
management has caused the Dean’s
office to run a large debt.

For the 1992-93 school year,
risk management payments cost
the Dean’s office approximately
$24,000. Because of improve-
ments in efficiency and policy, last
year’s and this year’s totals were

both $22,000. Starting next year,
says Holmes, the Dean’s office
will contribute $5,000 toward risk
management, leaving approxi-
mately $15,000 to be raised else-
where. Another $5,000 will come
from the houses themselves.

This new plan still lacks an-
other $10,000. And this is where
independents come in. Indepen-
dents will not have to make up the
difference, but according to

FLAG’s Sexuality Forum
triumphs in its fifth year

By ASHLYN DANNELLY
Staff writer

When Meg Jones, current
Night Manager of the College
Union, was a Davidson sophomore
in 1990, she organized a sparsely
attended sexuality forum through
the auspices of the Campus Fo-
rum. Three women alumnae spoke
about their homosexuality, but the
tone of the forum, according to
Jones, was “real serious ... the au-

dience was not very supportive.
They almost pushed the panel into
a corner of being defensive.”
How times have changed.
When four current Davidson stu-
dents and two 1994 graduates
walked onto the 900 Room stage
Monday night to discuss their sexu-
ality, the standing-room-only au-
dience roared their approval with
loud hoots, hollers, and whistles.
Jones says, “For the first fo-
rum, I had trouble finding people

to help put on a forum, and now
there are six students willing to
speak. Now, you can stand in the
middle of the Union and say ‘I’m
gay.’ That is nothing buta positive
direction. It is still not completely
safe, but there are outlets now.”
The forum was mediated by
former FLAG Co-chair Cat
Grimmel. Grimmel, a founding
member of the organization, rec-

Shames, they will have to pay a
“reasonable fee.” He says the PCC
will keep the charge for indepen-
dents “as little as possible.”
Holmes estimates that ap-
proximately 200 independents will
seek “Court membership,” which
means that they will be able to
attend all Court parties, but, ac-
cording to Shames, people who do

Co-ed
dorms

not to be
forgotten

By Jay JENNINGS
Staff writer

_ Although little has been said
about co-ed dorms since the SGA

of them, the issue has not been

forgotten.

However, they will not be in
place next year because dorms have
already been designated for the
1995-96 school year.

Kurt Holmes, acting Director
of Residence Life, feels that the
SGA resolution is important. He
says that it has spurred RLO to
investigate the issue and will help
the new director of Residence Life
come to a better understanding of
what students want.

RLOconducted some research
by comparing Davidson’s policy
on co-ed dorms to those of other
similar colleges. According to
Holmes, a “vast majority [of these
schools] have co-ed dorms.”

The controversy centers
around co-ed dorms for freshmen.
The idea of co-ed freshmen halls

_ comes into conflict with the great

monolith of single sex living, Belk
dorm. If Belk was made co-ed, it
would make the process of switch-
ing to this new policy easier.

The selection process for a
new director of Residence Life has
begun. This new director will ad-
dress the SGA’s resolution.
Holmes believes it is essential that
students keep the pressure on and
not simply forget about it. He said
in the director’s first year, the stu-
dents “must prove that there is
overwhelming support for the is-
