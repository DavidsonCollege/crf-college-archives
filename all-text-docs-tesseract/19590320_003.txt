The lack of suitable courts and good weather that
reduced pre-season practice to a minimum had tell-tale
effects on Dick McKee's netters in Charleston this week.

First match jitters were also present as the ’Cats
dropped their opener to George Washington, 6-3. Crafty
Semi Mintz, however, had on his mid-season thinking

Jim Tarr to the limit before losing in three sets. The
next day he out-smarted tough Jack Sterling for a three) j,.¢
set victory.

Showing the best form at this early date along
with Mintz wero Finley Lee and Dick Hodel. Lee was
a little tense in his first match, but managed to win
after going the three set limit. The next day it was
a different story as he won easily. He also teamed with
Doug Orr for two doubles wins, the second one being
the deciding match in the victory over Citadel.

The tenacious Hodel mechanically punched out two
straight set victories with the return-everything style
‘that won him the conference championship at six last
year.

Volleyball Gets Underway

By BILL GODWIN
Coach Heath Whittle said Wedesday that outstand-
ing efforts made by the Intramural Athletic Council
this year — its first — have been reflected in the bet-
ter organization of Inter-fraternity sports.

Incomplete results in volley-
ball Wednesday included eight
matches. The ATO's retained
their perfect record with vic-
tories over the Phi Delts and
the SPE’s. The Phi Delts won
over the Pikas, who were also
beaten by the Sigma Chis.

Sergeant James McCurry,

McBRYDE LEADS

Angus McBryde in the mile,
880 and javelin, and John Huie
in the pole vault and high jump
should be picked as key factors
in the Wildcats’ hopes. Mec-
Bryde is the Southern Confer.
ence champion in the mile.

Mel Armstrong should make
the dashes another strong
point. He, Marvin Bentley and
Ed Kizer will give these events
a depth unusual for Davidson
teams.

Coach Whittle seemed opti-
mistic as he discussed these
events and several others. He
is counting on Roger Beebe in
the 440 and Hugh Murray in
the broad jump to come
through this year. “They have
been coming along fine and
should really help us out,”
Whitle said.

Dole Is Satisfied
With Drill Results

Spring football drills ended
Tuesday and Coach Dole said,
“They're the best we've ever
had." Thirty-eight players re-
ported for practice, of which
12 were lettermen.

Until about a week ago,
starting guards and halfbacks
had not been decided upon. But
Wednesday Dole tentatively
named 195-pounder Alex Port-
er and 190-pounder John Crute
as his right and left guards.
respectively, ;

Leading the left halfbacks is
Dave McCullough, 200. Ibs. and
at right half Dole’s choice is
Grant McRorie, 160 Ibs.

Coach Dole particularly em.
phasized the fine work of ris-
ing sophomores. “The biggest
surprise was the way Duncan
Morgan performed afler we
converted him from end to left
halfback. Our sophomores will
play a lot of football next fall.”
