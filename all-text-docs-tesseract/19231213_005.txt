“The Day of Faith” Is
Picture for Saturday

One of the Latest Pictures Out—
Plot of Picture is Good and
Picture Thrilling

“The Day of Faith” will be shown at
the gym Saturday. This is a good pic-
ture made from a story which appeared
in serial.form in Collier’s Weekly and
was later published in book form, creating
quite a furore on account of the author’s
fanciful flights of imagination in hand-
ling an interesting theme. As a picture
it quite out the ordinary in the
tenseness of its drama. Just how strong!
it will please the average audience the
showing of the picture only will prove.

“The Day of Faith” is a problem play
based on the theory “My Neighbor Is
Perfect” and whether they approve or
not the unfolding of the production will
give theatre-goers much food for seri-
ous thought.

The picture is unusually well made and
much thought has been given not only
to the working out of the faith angle of |
the story, but to the direction and stag-
ing. The cast, which
Eleanor Boardman and
is good not only from the viewpoint of
box-office value, but also in the assign-
ment to characters,

The story starts with the experiences
of an dealist who believes the general
adoption of his creed “my neighbor is
perfect” would bring about the millen-
nium, In carrying this out to the extent
of saving a burglar who has caused the
death of a neighbor, the idealist. who is
a prominent small town banker incurs
the enmity of the daughter of the man
who died, Through her popularity she
works up such a strong feeling against
the idealist that he is forced to resign
from the bank and later dies as the re-
sult of mob violence.

devote her life and fortune to the fur-

creed, establishing in New York a mis-

series of adventures, wildly impossible

First Issue of Magazine

Popular With All Readers

Content of Literary Journal Merit
Approval for its Range in
. Thought and Subject Matter

The first issue of the Davidson College
Magazine which came out some time ago, |
and which is the first issue under the!
new policy adopted for it this year, has
met with almost universal approval. The}
magazine itself is considerably larger
than heretofore both in size and in num-
ber of pages, and is very attractively
printed on the best grade of white paper.

The contributions constitute a well-
balanced arrangement of fiction, essays, |
poetry and humor, Probably the best
short stories are “The Story Teller,” a!
story of the life in central China, and

“The Great Tribunal, a fantastic picture | - = |
| of which there is a smooth flow of words |

to the threshold of death and back. Two

good essays, “The Quest for Minerva,” |

and “Why is a College Education of
Value,” are well written and full of,
thought. Both are pleas for, and a de-!

fence of, education and the trained mind. |

In poetry there has appeared a new!
contributor in the person of J. H. Cal-
igan, a Freshman. He contributed the}
two best poems of the issue in “Evening |
Idyll,” and ‘Song of the Fisherman.”
The wording and meter are excellent for |
an amatuer poet. “Song” and “James
and John” are also very gond poems.
John Bryan furnished “The Lily Fields”
and several short poems in prose, in all

has never been excelled by any man in the

and surely that is the best of news.

Practice is getting stiffer, pep is rising,

CHARLEY HODGIN RETURNS
ON CRUTCHES TO CAMPUS

Charley Hodgin, whose leg was broken
in the game with Carolina three weeks
ago, returned to the hill last Saturday}
Everyone was very pleasantly surprised

to see him return so soon. He has spent
the time since the accident at his home|
in Greensboro, |

It was in the first play the game |
that Hodgin received his injury and it
was with deepest regret that the stu-|
dent body learned of the accident, It)
seems strange to see Charley walking}
around on crutches after the great style

‘of fight displayed by him all this past}

season, but he promises to discard this
unseemly mode of locomotion in a very!

few weeks.
