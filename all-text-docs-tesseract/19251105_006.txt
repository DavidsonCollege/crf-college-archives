the backwoods to smoke one of Skit Mc-

and a 15-yard penalty on State put the ball on
State’s 15-yard line. Nisbet gained eight |
yards in two plays and then Hendrix went
over for the touchdown.

Only once did State attempt a drop-kick
and then it was when McDowell tried a
drop-kick from the 45-yard line.

At another point they came to Davidson's
| 15-yard line, but never any further.

Scoring
| The first score of the game came soon
after the second quarter began.

Davidson in three plays had gained noth-
ing and with the ball on State’s 25-yard line,
| Coach Monk Younger sent in Allen, drop-
| kicker. Standing on the 35-yard line this
| white-haired lad sent the pigskin sailing far
|over the uprights and thus drew the first
{points for the Wildcats. :
Shortly after the fourth period began Da-
| vidson was given the ball on her own 20-yard
jline, when McDowell had kicked over the
' goal line.
| Then the Wildcats began to bewilder the
| State team and with the exception of one
exchange of pnts it was a continuous march
| down the field until Hendrix skipped across

for seven yards and a touchdown.

}it took Vance and Baker, those stellar for-

It was Hendrix leading in the backfield, |

backed up by the support of every David-

son back that began the game or who went |

in as a substitute.
| Nisbet, Charlotte boy, drove like a mad

|and tore off 21 yards at one clip, only to be|

| downed by State’s safety man.

| As a star, McDowell was woefully lacking
