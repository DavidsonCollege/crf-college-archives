q Scott To Propose
| Fall Link Season

By DAVE TIERNEY
Sports Writer

At the mecting of the South
ern Conference in May, Da-
vidson Athletic Director and
golf coach Tom Scott’ will
propose the addition of a fall
go season,

Included in this fall ses-
sion would be two or three
tournaments or matches, plus
the first round of the South-
ern Conference tournament.

“A fall season actually is
quite logical,"’ commented
Scott; “because the weather
is better, the courses are in
better condition, and the boys
are also in top shape, hav-
ing played all summer."

The team thus far has had
one match snowed out and
another was played in cold,
rainy weather.

The new format would also
lengthen the season, which is
how confined to the month
of April, due to conflicts with
other conference members.

Scott “believes the teams
often do not perform up to
their capabilities because the

conference meet is tou early.

“The long wenter layover
forces the boys to start anew,
but in the fall their fame
should be at its best,’ he
said, ,

Scott also belives the divi-
sion of the conference tour-
nament, with two rounds in
the fall and two in the spring,
would be. beneficial.

This weekend the team is
competing in one of the
largest. tournaments in the
South, the ‘first annual Chris
Schenkel Invitation at States
boro, Ga.

will be
Miami,

The competition
tremendously tough.
Georgia, and Florida, consid-
ered by Scott to be among
the top ten in the country,

will all be play there.

Last ne a Ne ‘Cats
played a tough-North Caro-
lina squad, and while going
to defeat, they played their
best golf this year.

The top five men for Da-
vidson averaged 75, with
freshmen Jim Ray and Dick
Spinner each } shoeing 74's,
