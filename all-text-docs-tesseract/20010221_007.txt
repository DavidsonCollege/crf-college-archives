THE DAvIDSONIAN -

fevers 2001:

How do I find a roommate?

The Residence Life Office front desk keeps
‘a running list of names of students who are
looking for roommates. Ask to have your
name added to the list. It is also advisable to
let your fraternity or eating-house know so
that they can help you network.

If I get permission to live off campus,
how doI go about finding a place to live?

The Residence Life Office has an updated
list of properties. This list is made up of
people in the community who are interested
in renting to students.

What happens if I apply for a single and
do not get one?

A student who goes to Single Room Lot-
tery night and does not get a single will goon
the waitlist in lottery number order. Any
student who asks tobe added to the single
waitlist will go on that waitlist after the
students who attended Single Room Lottery
night and will be added by the date and time
the request is made. At that point you can

choose to match up with another students
whois on the single room waitlist to apply for
a double room together, knowing fully that if
either were offered a single room it would be
accepted.

Can my friends and I “cluster’’ in the
single room sections of West Residence
Hall?

No single room clusters are allowed next
year. This is a change of policy aimed at
providing more single rooms.

Can I change rooms after lottery?

After April 11th (the final phase of lottery)
there are no room changes allowed until May
1. This allows for Residence Life to make an
assessment of the pressing needs of those
students who are still on the waitlist for
housing. After May 1, students can choose to
“switch” rooms with other students as long as
the quotas per floor are met and each student
who changes their room assignment will be
charged a fee of $30 each.

What’s going on? : Frequently Asked Questions about the lottery”

Iam arising junior. Can I get an apart-
ment in Martin Court?

Phase II of Lottery (March 27th) is the time
for rising juniors to apply for a Martin Court
Apartment. All senior groups will be accom-
modated first and any remaining apartments
will be assigned to “mixed groups” (rising
senior and rising junior) which is determined
by lottery number total for the group.

Are seniors guaranteed an apartment in
Martin Court?

There are 338 beds in the Martin Court
complex. The rising senior class (2002) has
449 students. Some, of course, will apply for
off campus permission. Also the students
who are on staff will make up their own
groups, which may include students who are
not seniors.

What are the options for substance free
housing?

The third floor of Belk will be substance
free housing in 2001-2002. The first and
second floors are set aside for the incoming

freshman class. Also, Irwin, Sentelle and
Richardson will be smoke-free next year.

Will furniture be provided for the com-
mon rooms in the West pods?

Yes. RLO will provide a round table, four
chairs and limited furniture for the pod com-
mon areas.

What if I want to be on the Reskienet
Life Staff?

Applications were due January 31, 2001
and decisions for the 2001-2002 staff will be
made by February 28, 2001. Any candidate
who accepts an RLO staff position will re-
ceive their staff assignment from RLO and
not need to participate in the Lottery process.

My friends and I are interested in living
in a triple room. Can we do that?

The only triples available will be in 411
and 429 Belk. Any other triples (including
Patterson Court apartments) are no longer
allowed as a housing option. ~

Take your pick: dorm by dorm analysis of residential options

Martin Court Senior Apartments
(Flowe, Hart, ApartmentF, ApartmentB,
Jamieson, Ryburn)

Good: Premier residences on campus re-
served almost en-
tirely for seniors.
Each unit contains
a kitchen and liv-
ing room. It’s not
far from the
Knobloch Campus
Center, which is
expected to- be
open by next year.

Bad: Long walk
to class and Main
Street.

Who Lives
There: Seniors.

“Down _ the
Hill” (Knox,
Irwin, Akers)

Good: Often
called “Sopho-
more City,” these
apartment build-
ings are located
“down the hill” on
Patterson Court, so
you always know.
where the parties
are. You’re also
close to the intra-
mural and baseball
fields. Irwin will
be a smoke-free hall next year.

Bad: The noise from the fraternities can be
distracting, especially if you’ re trying to study.
You’ve also got to walk several hundred
yards to get to class and Main Street.

Who Lives There: Sophomores who can’t

get aroom “up the hill” or who love to party. °

“Row Dorms’’

Duke

Good: Mostly for juniors, this three-story
hall is located near the football field, Little
Library, and Belk Arena. It contains single
rooms, spacious doubles, and a few suites.
Juniors who wish to be located in the middle
of campus prefer this hall. It was newly
painted and carpeted this past summer.
_ Bad: One of the oldest buildings on cam-
pus. When you look atit from the outside, you
can tell.

Who Lives There: Juniors who want to be
located in the middle of campus.

Prime real estate: the Senior Apartments

Richardson

Good: Close to Vail Commons, Patterson
Court and Chambers. Next year, it will be a
smoke-free hall. Easy access to parking all
over campus.

Bad: Some consider it the least attractive
living option on campus. Rooms are small
and most furniture is fixed against the walls,
so you can’t move it. Things seems old and
worn. The basement floor windows are only
partially above the ground.

Who: Freshmen.

Little

Good: Close to Chambers, Main Street and
the Belk parking lot.

Bad: Aptly named; some of the smallest
rooms of any hall.

Who: All women; three halls for freshmen

and one for upperclassmen.

West

Good: Opened last fall, so everything is
new. Lots of privacy, close to the Patterson
Court, Vail Commons, the outdoor basket-
ball court and the Belk parking lot.

Bad: Students
clean their own
bathrooms. Long
walk to the new
center of campus
~ Knobloch Cam-
pus Center, Baker
Sports Complex,
Little Library and
Chambers. Cam-
pus Safety is right
downstairs.

Who Lives
There: It’s one of
the most popular
options on cam-
pus, so mostly
juniors and se-
niors and a few
lucky _sopho-
mores live there.
Next year, stu-
dents will not be
allowed to form
“clusters” of eight
in the singleroom
sections. These
rooms will be as-
signed indepen-
dently. Students
can still form four-
person suites.

Belk

Good: By far the largest hall on campus,
this dorm houses quite a diverse co-ed popu-
lation. The second and third floors are sub-
stance-free halls for freshmen and sopho-
mores, respectively. Centrally located near
Vail Commons, Chambers, and the laundry
building.

-Bad: Many of the beds don’t loft. The
lounges are not as well-furnished as some of
the other halls. Noise travels easily through
the halls. The fire alarm goes off once every
few months.

Who: Freshmen on the first and second
floors, sophomores on the third and fourth
floors. The only triple-rooms next year will
be No. 411 and No. 429.

Sentelle

Good: The rooms are big and fairly new,
and you can move the furniture around as
well. Located pretty evenly between Cham-
bers, the library, Baker, Vail Commons and
Patterson Court.

Bad: Construction noise at 6 a.m. is no fun.

Who: Juniors and a few lucky sophomores.

Cannon

Good: Nearly identical to its next-door
neighbor, Sentelle.

Bad: Ditto

Who: Juniors, Sophmores, Freshmen, men
and women

Watts:

Good: Good location and spacious rooms.
Unlike in Richardson, you can move the
furniture and adjust the beds.

Bad: Sophmores might feel a little dis-
placed from the rest of their class. Parking is
limited.

Who: All men; three floors of freshmen,
one sophomore hall.

RLO,

the bottom floor of West Hall.

Students will form a line and choose a
room that hasn’t been crossed off when their
number is called. They will be able to see
their friends’ choices and-consult with each
other before making a final decision on where
to live.

The lucky ones will get their top choice.
Andeven students near the bottom, like Gould,
may not come out so bad.

“That’s not necessarily a bad place to be,”
Holmes said. “Sometimes you get a whole lot
better room than you would have gotten (with
a higher number).”

That’s because students with low numbers
may be put on a waiting list. When juniors
decide to study abroad or live off-campus, the
rooms they would have stayed in will instead
be given to the freshmen on the waiting list.

These types of nuances confuse and even

_anger some Davidson students. But Holmes

says they also are one example of the flexibil-
ity the school uses in working with students
to find suitable solutions to their eens
dilemmas.

“Tt seems to be fair and equitable, ” he said
of the lottery system. “It all works out. No-
body will end up without a room.”
