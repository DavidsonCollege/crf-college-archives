Trustees Consider Housing,Union Plans

By MICHAEL TANNER
Executive Editor

At last week’s meeting of the
Board of Trustees, plans for the
location of union facilities and
for future student housing were
discussed, in addition to the at-
tention given to the question of
athletics.

The Building and Grounds
Committee of the board ap-
proved the renovation of Grey
Library for use as the new
Student Union.

It is hoped that the conversion
work will begin as soon as the
books are transferred to the
new Little Library, but before
the nature and scope of any
such work can be determined,
costs are to be given further
study.

The Finance and Manage-
ment Committee (FMC) will
present cost figures for the
various renovation alter-
natives before it will be decided
what specifically will be done.

Gridders Resigned
To Desubsidization

By TOM BRUCE
Associate Editor

Most members of the football
team at Davidson favored a
change in the football program,
but very few are completely
satisfied with the Trustee-
approved plan to de-subsidize
football and revamp schedules
to accomodate less challenging
schools.

“Something had to be done
about the odds we were facing
when we went out on the field,”’
stated Co-captain Eddie
Williamson. ‘‘It was a case of
thirty scholarships pitted again-
st one hundred or more "’

“IT would not have had the
chance to come to Davidson if
we had not had subsidized foot-
ball when I was applying to
colleges. I feel like we may lose
some players to schools that of-
fer scholarships, and this sad-
dens me.”

Williamson remarked that he
was especially upset about
some of the reasons for desub-

Puckett
Campaign

A campaign for funds is
currently underway to found an

endowed professorship at
Davidson as a memorial to
W. Olin Puckett.

Donald L. Winston, Director
of Development, disclosed that
$210,000 has been raised thus
far. The drive will hopefully be
concluded by June, he in-
dicated.

Five percent interest from
the ultimate goal of $500,000
would provide an annual in-
come of $25,000. This would
finance the salary and teaching
needs of an outstanding biology
teacher who would also be an in-
tegral part of Davidson's pre-
medical team.

The basis of the campaign is a
committee of 50 doctors who are
in the process of soliciting their
medical colleagues.

This is the first time Davidson
College has asked its medical
alumni to support a program
which will directly benefit the
medical sciences.

W. Olin Puckett was a well-
known and respected professor
of biology at Davidson. Upon his
retirement in 1970, he had also
been the guiding light of the pre-
medical program for 24 years.

‘I’m aware that some people
believe that we will have to
sacrifice academic standards if
we emphasize football, but this
attitude is inconsistent with fac-
ts.

“This prejudice is the same
as that shown to certain ethnic
groups or toward people from
different places in the country
that have received bad treat-
ment.”

Junior David Harper saw the
change in positive terms, but he
admitted that he would have
preferred increasing the sup-
port given to football.

“The odds we've had for the
past couple of years have been
sort of unrealistic,’’ said Har-
per, ‘‘we need to start the
season off at more equal ter-
“During the past few games,
I have been very encouraged
about our program. I only hope
that the rug isn't being pulled
out from underneath us.”’

Most of the players who were
questioned said that the most
glaring problem to confront the
new program will be recruit-
ment.

Walker and Hesterberg were
both skeptical about the
feasibility of reducing costs by
cutting grants to football
players. They maintained that
Many major costs, such as tran-
not be changed by the trustee

Senior Mike Harding saw the
decision somewhat more op-
timistically than did most of his
teammates. ‘‘What it means is
simply this: in two years time
Davidson will be playing a win-
ning football season, and for
Coach Fagg, this factor
probably can’t be over-
estimated.

“Coach Fagg is looking for-
ward to it in a special way. Not
many people would have stuck
with Davidson througn ali that
he has. He really wants to win.”’

Perhaps the overall
decision of the team is best
summed up by John Webel. “It
really wasn't fair to anyone to
keep on the way we were, so a
change was for the best.”’

“You can look at the change
in two ways: we'll lose certain
athletes who would have been
attracted by the money grants,
but we'll gain support from
other prospects and the student
body who will be much more en-
thusiastic toward the sport
when they can cheer for a win-
ning team.”

College President Samuel R.
Spencer, Jr. said ‘‘We won't
know what proposals are prac-
tical until we get the results of
the cost study.”’

Concerning the module-unit
student housing, trustee action
was postponed until the
February - meeting. It was
decided that finance problems
existed in the construction and
maintainence of the proposed
units.

The administration will
review several alternatives for
the financing of the living units
and will recommend a course of
action to the FMC in February.

The trustees will screen the
recommendations and decide
how the project is to be ap-
proached at their next meeting.

Spencer listed several options
for the financing of the housing.
They are as follows:

1) the college would borrow
money (at a high interest rate)
and repay this by charging a
high rent for the constructed
housing.

2) the college would borrow
money (again at a high interest
rate) and repay it by raising the
rent of all rooms on campus.

3) the college would en-
courage outside developers to
build housing facilities off cam-
pus to alleviate the strain on
the dormitories.

4) the college would decide to
scrap the module-unit living
concept and construct a
cheaper facility, probably
something similar to the
present dormitories.

Davidson's pre-medical
program is on the move. But no
one seems willing to say where
or how fast it’s moving.

The pre-medical committee is
in the midst of eorganization.

Its membership has been in-—

creased from six to 12 faculty
members, and each pre-med
student will be assigned to one
advisor.

When asked about the
reorganization, pre-medical ad-
visor James M. Fredericksen
was evasive and reluctant to
say anything about the progress
of the new pre-med committee.

Professor of Biology Donald
L. Kimmel Jr., author of a 1972
report which recommended
restructuring Davidson's pre-
medical program, said pre-med
counseling in the past has been
inadequate.

‘The committee didn’t advise
and the chairman had too many
people to advise,”’ said Kimmel
of the old pre-med program.

Expansion of the committee
will hopefully eliminate the long
lines of pre-meds which used to
wait outside the door of
Fredericksen’s office.

Fredericksen said he would
have liked to reserve comment
until the new program was
“‘operational,”’ which he said
could be as long asa year.

February,’’ Spencer said.
Other action last week cen-
tered around faculty evalua-
tion. The faculty presented
its system for self-evaluation
to the Educational and Execu-
tive Committees for review,
approval and modification,
if necessary. These committees
of the board will deliver their

comments in February.

The faculty suggested that
the administration should also
devise a system for self-
evaluation. In response to this,
the Executive Committee of the
board asked Spencer and Chair-
man of the Board Warner Hall
to formulate such a system to
submit in February.

Pre-medical advisor James M. Fredericksen was reluctant to
comment on the recent shuffle in the pre-med committee The com-
possibilities as well as the mittee has been increased from six to twelve members and each
respective costs tothe board in pre-med student will be assigned to one advisor.

Pre-Med Program Reorganizes
To Face Stiffer Competition

When pressed for comment,
Fredericksen showed little en-
thusiasm for the reforms. ‘‘The
whole thing is still nebulous and
we're feeling our way,” he said.

Fredericksen talked most
about improving the pre-
medical advising for freshmen
and sophomores.
Fredericksen talked most
about improving the pre-
medical advising for freshmen
and sophomores.

“The junior year is kind of
late in the day to be looking for
an alternative to medical
school,’’ said Fredericksen,
who has been advising pre-
meds for 25 years.

A very important part of pre-
med advising, he said, is
helping the person on the bor-
derline of acceptance to
medical school.

The pre-med committee
members will act as adjunct ad-
visors to the freshman advisors.

This should help the student
decide early whether he has a
chance to be admitted to
medical school, Fredericksen
explained.

Fredericksen had little to say
about improvements in the pre-
med curriculum, a point Kim-
mel felt should receive at-
tention.

Kimmel said courses essen-
tial for the pre-med like
biochemistry, physiology, and

vertebrate morphology, should
be offered as a sequence.

Pre-med students are often
wary of non-science courses
which might lower their grade-
point averages. ‘‘So many times
students use the flexibility to
take courses which will in-
fluence the GPA,” Kimmel
pointed out.

Kimmel also underlined the
importance of helping the bor-
der-line pre-med who has little
chance of getting into med
school.

According to Fredericksen,
information for pre-medical
students about allied life scien-
ce fields will be collected in a
pamphlet, but publication has
been temporarily delayed.
