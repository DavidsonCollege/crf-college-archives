Six classes will come together
next weekend for numerous fes-
tivities in the second of two annual
alumnae weekends.

According to John Cook, As-
sistant to the Director of Alumni

-Relations, this weekend will be “a
little bigger than Homecoming.”
Over 400 alums will be oncampus.

The weekend will consist of
events ranging from a panel on tort
reform to a FLAG reception.

The panel, in which almuni
will speak, will begin the week-
end. Also on Friday, alumni will
dine with their respective classes
and attend “Coffee. and Cordials”
on the terrace of Vail Commons.

- Saturday, alumni will relive
their freshman year with a cake
race and a flickerball game, in
which the 1975 champions will
battle it out with the 1995 champi-
ons.

and alinmmntts the ~

“This will be a neat interaction
between the two.”

Each class will also take a
walking tour of “New Davidson.”
Cook says that the tour will be
good for alumni _ because
“Davidson has really changed in
the last 30 years. For most of the
classes, there weren’teven women
here.”

““They love coming back to
see their old friends and the cam-
pus,” says Cook, “Our job is easy

Gullan to give “State
of School address”

by Farley, who is also chair of the
student/faculty/staff roundtable
committee, will explore issues rel-
evant tothe SGA, suchas the Honor
Code, the alcohol policy, race rela-
tions, and the possibility of aca-
demic minors.

To conclude the day, at 9:30
p.m., all students are invited to
attend a study break in which SGA
President Bill Gullan will deliver a
“State of the School” address.

Sophomore SGA Vice Presi-
dent Warren Buford states his
hopes for the day: “taking just one
day is not enough, but it is a begin-
ning, and hopefully will prove
helpful in teaching students and
faculty about the SGA and intro-
ducing everyone to what we do,
and can do.”

“I look forward to fulfilling
these objectives and having a little
fun on a day that falls so close to
exams,” he says.

The SGA will hold the first
ever “SGA Day” this Thursday.
This event seeks to create a better
working relationship between stu-
dents, the SGA, and faculty. BSC
senator sophomore Mike Farley
explains that the event “makes
strides to give students better ac-
cess to the SGA,”

The scheduled events are as
follows: From 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., an
informational video about the SGA
and its senators will be shown at
the Union Pit. In addition, the
SGA will set up a bulletin board in
Chambers to acquaint students with
the duties of the SGA and the tasks
of each of its committee.

From 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., all
students are invited to attend a free
cookout on the Union Patio. At 6
p.m., arountable discussion headed

which identifies them as being over
or under 21 years old.

The wristband plan hinges on
creating a set guest list and closed
parties. While just how the PCC
will accomplish this is far from

determined, the wristbands will -

identify Court members. SaidSGA
President Bill Gullan, a voting
member of the CCRL, “There will
be a term called ‘Patterson Court
member’ in this policy.” Who will
be “Court members” is yet to be
determined.

PCC President Steven
Shames, a voting member of the
CCRL, said, “It’s a very proactive
measure. It protects us in risk
managementand in liability.” Burt
Arrington, a member of the PCC
and a non-voting member of the
CCRL, praised the wristband strat-
egy: “I don’t think there is one
good objection you can make
against wristbands — except that
it’s a pain in the butt.”

All parties will be required to
have a trained bartender and/or a
risk manager who will tend the bar
and must be trained in intervention
procedures. There will also be a

sober monitor and a police officer. —

The guidelines for these four posi-
tions will not be included in the
policy, buta mission statement and
procedures will be included in the
alcohol policy. At the meeting, it
was suggested that the mission

statementand procedures be placed
in the Redbook.

One contentious issue was the
cut-off time for serving alcohol.
Many ofthe students on the APRTF
and the CCRL were in favor of
following state guidelines, which
allow alcohol to be served until 2
a.m. on weekdays and 3 a.m. on
weekends. The current at policy at
Davidson is 12 a.m. on weekdays
and | a.m. on weekends.

Those in favor of the change
argue that when the kegs stop flow-
ing, students drive drunk to bars.
Arrington says, “It happens all the
time.” Proponents say extending
the serving hours would help keep
students safe.

Shandley, who heads the
CCRL, indicated that change
would be very hard to sell to the
president and the board. He says,
“This will be a real, real point of
contention, I suspect.”

Shandlley was correct. When
the CCRL’s proposal was sent to
the president, he disagreed that al-
cohol ought to be served until two,
but he allowed the change to be
presented to the board with an ad-
dendum noting his objection.

At the trustees’ meeting,
Gullan spoke in favor of the change,
while Shandley and Professor Bob
Manning spoke against it. The
trustees favored Shandley’s and
Mannitig’s arguments and reject
extending service hours on week-
days but will allow alcohol to be
served until 2 a.m. on weekends.

. Speaking for the SGA, Gullan
says, “The window between state
law and the Davidson rule still is to
large. The SGA will be looking for
other ways to address the consid-
erable drinking and driving that
occurs in such situations.”

The trustees approved the
CCRL’s proposal otherwise.
