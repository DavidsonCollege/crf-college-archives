SENIOR SCHOLARSHIP PLAN
WAS QUOTED INCORRECTLY

Plan for Loan Fund Not Presented
to Seniors in Way Reported.

Through error the write-up of the
alumni loan fund plan reported in last
week’s paper as having been launched
by the present Senior class exceeded the
actual facts in the case, and The Da-
vidsonian is glad to make correction.

In the first place, information is given
that the first paragraph was in error as
no definite action on any matter was
taken. Coach Grey merely presented
some propositions to the class to see
what they thought ofthem, intending
that definite decision if reached at all
should come later. In the second place,

Honorary Fraternity Has Good Men
in Membership.
The Sigma Upsilon is an honorary fra-
|ternity which fosters the appreciative
| study and original creation of literature ©
by college men. Incidentally it encour-
ages work for the college publications,
and it brings the leading literary men of
the campus together. in a social way. -
There are at present 21 chapters of
Sigma Upsilon, scattered all through the
Southland and as far west as Utah and
Oregon. These chapters are adminis-
|tered by a general council of which, as

|
t

This is the third chapter to be install-
ed. Foresecing the need of an honorary

organization of this kind in the smaller |

institution, the fraternity was founded
at Davidson in January, 1920, by L. P
Good, M. A. Siske and M. R. Doubles.
Since that time the local chapter has
become greatly strengthened by the
initiation of honor chemistry students
and today the organization at Davidson
is the livest function of the chemical
department. It has been a great aid
in assisting the department to estab-
lish the newly installed change of cur-

riculum and today is bending all efforts |

to the maintenance of a high standard in
these. The honor men of the upper two
classes, who compose the fraternity’s
membership, are assisting materially in
setting straight the men beginning chem-
istry in their many problems, and as a
results, the enrollment in this depart-
ment is today the largest in the history
of the college.

The second chapter was installed at
N. C. State Coffege, Raleigh, N. C., in
February, 1921, and since then has flour-
ished exceedingly. The chemical fac-

ulty at this institution also see the great |
help it has been in inducing interest in}

the department and they are enthusi-
astically supporting the work. The
chapter is very much alive and is ac-
complishing great things in its line of
work,

The installation of the third chapter
at this time, at the University of Flor-
ida, marks an epoch in the life of the
organization. It is now ranked among
the honorary scientific fraternities and
from now on will hold an important
place in this field. The fraternity is the
only one of its type. The other two
large fraternities are limited to institu-
tions where an: extensive research de-
partment is maintained and they also
include—other—branches~—of-science—in
their membership. Gamma Sigma Epsi-
lon is rapidly filling in the breach and
is bringing to the leading universjties
the proposition of its honorary scholas-
tic fraternity. Many of the South’s
leading institutions have taken the mat-
ter up and are in active communication
with the fraternity and it seems only
matter of time before the order will
flourish throughout the South.

‘Seven Quills Awarded Each Year to
Members of Club.

The Order of the Golden Quill was

‘ founded in 1920 to give recognition to

\the faithful reporters who had made
possible the phenomenal growth of the
reportorial part of The Davidsonian in
jthat year.
|}clared Wearers of the Golden Quill.

' When the constitution of the Report-
ers’ Club was revised in 1921, it was pro-
vided that seven men should be chosen
for this honor each year by the man-
aging editor and the president of the
| Reporters’ Club, the awards being made
jat Junior Speaking. Only members of
the Reporters’ Club are eligible.

Seven niore men were dubbed Wear-
fers of the Golden Quill in 1921, and one
|or two honorary wearers were accepted,
among whom was Dave Roberts, the
real founder of the order. It should be
understood that this order is not a fra-
ternity, such as Sigma Upsilon or Delta
| Pi Kappa, but is based entirely on merit
and is organized on much the same’ basis
as the “D” Club.

PROSPECTIVE WILCAT FIVE

Two of Last Year’s Men.and Many
Likely Contenders Out...

Tala )

As a culmination of the mosti success-
ful class basketball sea@son in the his-
tory of Davidson, 30 men answered the
first call of Coach Hengeveld last week
for varsity practice.

Although no games will be played till
after the Christmas holidays, the atmos-
phere is saturated with the “Old Wild-
cat” basketball enthusiasm and it is evi-
dent that the Wildcat varsity this year
will be-one-that—will uphold past rec-
ofds.

Captain Pat Crawford is the most con-
spicuous man on the floor, and it will
be around this stalwart guard that Coach
Hengeveld will develop his “lightning”
squad, The only other letter man who

occur, it is certain that Nappy will con-
stitute a unit of the ’22 quintette.

it would be impossible to attempt a fore-
cast of the line-up. Price, Ormond, Mal-
lory, Ballard, Boggs, DeArman, Gentry,
George Mauze, and others, are showing
up especially well.

Work till Christmas will be elemen-
tary, but vital to the success of the
team, and every effort is being made by
Coach Hengeveld, by John
Schenck, to work the men into shape.
It is evident that the team will be light
{in weight, but the system which Coach
has up his sleeve will function so as
to best offset this handicap.

|MR. R. E. MELL SPOKE AT

Y. M. C. A. LAST SUNDAY

Fifty Men Signed Covenant of the
Pocket Testament League.

| Mr. Robert E. Mell, of the Rock Hill
|Y. M. C. A., conducted the last “Y” ves-
| per service. By request he spoke on the
|same subject that he used here last year,
“The Pocket Testament League.” His
song service and his own vocal solo
added much to the success of the meet-
ing.

His address was begun in a rather un
usual, yet successful, manner. He called
for several voluntary testimonials from
members of the Pocket Testament
League who have been helped by mem-
bership in it. Enthusiastic responses
were made by I, Baker, Ed Cunning-
ham, W. W. Moore, Dwight Chambers,
J. P. Price, and C, D. Tuller.

After this, just what is meant by the
Pocket Testament League was explain-
ed. In order to secure membership in
it the following must be signed: “I
hereby accept membership in the Pocket
Testament League by making it the
rule of my life to read at least one chap-
ter in the Bible cach day, and to carry
a Bible or Testament with me wherever
I go.” This is not a pledge, but a re-
solve, an intention, a purpose.

Mr.-Mell divided all Bible readers into
four classes. First, are those who sel-

|J. SS. BACHMAN IS WINNER
| IN FALL GOLF TOURNAMENT

Secures Title by Defeating Brice in
the Second Round.

| The first flight of the golf tournament
|came to an end Monday afternoon when
| Bachman defeated Brice in a one-sided
| match.

Bachman first met Dr. J. M. McCon-
nell, and after a very close game de-
| feated him 2 up. Dr. McConnell’s game
!for the first round was nothing short
lof spectacular; Bachman was somewhat
| off his usual game, and was 3 down at
|the end of the first round, but staged an

/unusual come-back during the second

~|round, and the score was even at the

fifth hole. The match ended with Bach-
man 2up. The score for the two rounds
was Dr. McConnell 86, Bachman 8s.
This was one of the most interesting
and closely contested matches in the
tournament.
| Charnley forfeited to Malloy, and Mal-
'loy gave his place to Brice, who played

”| and defeated Professor Wood, and play-

ed the finals with Bachman Monday aft-
ernoon. Brice undoubtedly was not play-
ing at his best and Bachman on his cus-
tomary game had him 7 down at the end
of the first round. He forfeited the sec-
ond round, leaving Bachman the undis-
puted championship title..
