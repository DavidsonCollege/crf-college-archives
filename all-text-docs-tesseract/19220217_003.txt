DR. WHALING HAS MANY
INTERVIEWS WITH STUDENTS

Dr. Thornton Whaling, now Profes-
sor of Theology in Louisville Theolog-
ical Seminary, spent Saturday after-
noon on the hill holding interviews with
students who wished to talk about their
seminary courses.

The doctor held his interviews in the
parlor of the library, and was kept busy
all afternoon without a let up. He de-
scribed many interesting features of the
work at Louisville.

D.
PATTERSON MAKES BRIEF
TALK TO VOLUNTEERS

Henry Patterson outlined the werk of
our mission in Africa to the Volunteers
Sunday morning in a concisive and ap-
pealing way. Begun in 1890, by’ two
missionaries, Lapsley and Sheppard (the
latter colored), there are now sixty-four
missionaries on the field assisted by
nearly two thousand native workers.
They are eager to serve, these natives,
and care has to be taken in accepting
them for those of the so common ultra-
emotional type must be carefully guard-
ed against.
membership is examined from three to
six times before he is received and after-
wards his life must be true to his vows.
Patterson in closing spoke of danger of
our mission field from the heathen creeds
coming down from the north and also
of the lack of education and progress
incident to the Roman Catholic work
nearby.

Bachelor, from Columbia Theological
Seminary, added points of interest on
the heroic lives of the early men and
women who opened up this field. Hay,
also from Columbia, urged upon all the
motto, “Always steadfast to heed God's
call.” He pointed out that men have
been selected by God himself to do Hlis
work in this world.

Pleasant plans were discussed for a
feed in the near future when the Vol-
unteer Convention at Greensboro next
month will be under consideration.

PAT CRAWFORD SPEAKS TO
HI-Y CLUB OF CHARLOTTE

The Hi-Y Club of the Charlotte Y. M.
C. A. enjoyed a treat last Sunday after-
noon at 3:30 when Pat Crawford made
an excellent talk on the manhood of the
Master. :

Pat prefaced his talk by several re-
marks commending the Hi-Y Club, tell-
ing what he himself had. seen it ac-
complish. He thén drew a striking con-
trast between the paintings of Jesus and
the real Jesus. The Christs of the
artists were weak, emaciated, and ef-
feminate with the one redeeming feattre
that they did portray gentleness. But
the real Christ as we sce him was a tall,
broad-shouldered, handsome son of a
worker if the hardest trade at that time.
For the tarpénter of Christ’s time must
be a real man physically, and Jesus was
trained in this trade. Besides this Christ
was a friendly, cheerful, forceful man
whose personality attracted men with a
tremendous force.

In closing Crawford called on the mem-
bers of the club to emulate Christ and
study to be more like Him. They must
fight to win in everything now and thus
be better equipped for the life of con-
structive citizens later.

A large, attentive audience and good
music further added to the success of
the meeting.

BEATTY AND YANDELL SPEAK
TO THE MINISTERIAL BAND

The meeting of the Ministerial Band
on last Sunday was conducted by the
visiting students from Columbia The-
ological Seminary. The quartet render-
ed a_ selection, “Upon the Rock of
Christ’s Salvation,” in a yery pleasing
and impressive manner. Two members
of the group, Messrs. Beatty and Yandell,
both alumni of Davidson, made very
helpful talks to the band. Beatty spoke
of life in college. He dealt with the
three phases of college activities: so-
cial, intellectual, and spiritual He spoke
of the need and the importance of
Christian influence in the social life of
a college, and also of Christian prin-
ciples in the intellectual activities. The
spiritual life, he.claimed to be of prime
importance, as the character of the

other activities depended largely on the
quality of the spiritual life on the cam-
pus. He appealed for more complete
surrender to Jesus Christ the end

might be strengthened. Mr Yandell

of God too much, he declared, as the
grace of God exceeded all that man
could expect. He spoke of the impor-
tance of self-consecration and its un-
limited possibilities for good.

In a sense, the meeting was a prepara-
tory service for the “Y” meeting. An un-
usually large number was present. An-
nouncement was made of the plans of
the consecration committee for the in-
jcrease of the morning watch on the cam-
pus. The meeting was unusually im-
pressive,

DR. HENRY SWEETS IS TO
SPEAK AT “Y” ON SUNDAY

Dr. Henry H. Sweets, who is Secre-
tary of the Christian Education and Min-
isterial Relief Committee of the South-
Presbyterian Church, will be the
}speaker at the “Y” service of next Sun-
day.

Dr. Sweets is one of the most widely

his gift of speaking. .It is certain that
all who attend the meeting at which he
‘is to speak will hear a stirring and bene-
ficial talk.

DAVIDSON MEN GIVE

TO HANGCHOW COLLEGE

It has been the custom for a number
of years at Davidson for each man of
the student body to subscribe annually
to a fund known the “Parker Me-
morial Fund,” the money raised being
used to support a missionary in China.
This year the plan was changed some-
what. Instead of using the money as it
has been heretofore, it will be used to
send a Davidson man to Hanchow Col-
lege, China, as an instructor. All who
heard Dr. Blain’s lecture on “Hang-
chow” last Friday are familiar with the
good work being: done there. It may
also be well to say that it is the only
college in China supported entirely by
the Southern Presbyterian Church.

In the drive put on by the “Y” im-
mediately after Dr. Blain’s lecture, $735
was raised by subscription. W. I, Knox
stated that of 300 fellows seen, 206 sign-
ed pledge cards. The average subscrip-
tion per man was $2.65.

Although it considered that the
amount was very good, considering the
number of fellows seen, it is still short
of the $1,000 goal placed by the “Y.”
In| order to give those who have not

is

given, an opportunity to do so, a clean-
up drive will be held some time this
week,

The purpose of the fund, as has al-
ready been stated, is to send a Davidson
man to Hangchow College as instractor.
3ut in the event that no man can be
found for the? place, the fund will be
used for the general support of the col-
lege.

THE MICROBE OF LOVE TO
BE SFAGED AT DAVIDSON

Those who enjoy a good, snappy, musi-
cal comely wil have an opportunity of
secing one Yn “The Microbe of Love” to
be given at Davidson on Friday evening,
February 24th, in Shearer Hall. “The
Microbe of Love” will be presented un-
der the auspices of the local post of the
American Legion. Local talent will take
part in the play assisted by a few of the
members of the Davidson Glee Club.
Miss Margaret Davison, of Atlanta, who
has had a great deal of experience in
getting up similar performances,
coming soon to help with the play.

“The Microbe of Love” has made a
big hit wherever.it has been given, most
places wanting a return engagement. It
goes to Wake Forest from here. When
Harry Caldwell, the promoter of the
play was interviewed he said that a num-
ber of young ladies from Charlotte were
anxious to take part in the play but it
was thought best to have alf local talent.

The reserved seats for the performance
will be seventy-five cents, general ad-
mission fifty cents, children will be ad-

Dr. J. M. Douglas has issued a ra

the athletic policy of the college. It is |

was as follows:

“At a meeting of the faculty of David-|

cided that the college was in need of al
new athletic policy. Particularly was it
desired that the alumni should have a}
voice in the control of athletics. After!
consulting several alumni it was decided |
to place the control of all athletics in
the hands of an Athletic Council. This!

contrary to the historic policy of Da-
