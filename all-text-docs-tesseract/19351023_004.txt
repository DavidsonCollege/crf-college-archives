Coach Tatum Greesette of the

the cats a little cocky over the

Challenged By B Team

The All-American football team,
coached by “Doc” Unger, issued a
formal challenge to the Freshman
team last Monday afternoon, con-
firming a verbal challenge previous-
ly made. The challenge, read by
Coach Flake Laird to his Red Caps,
said, in part:

“We, the Davidson College ‘B”’
team, better known as the All-Amer-
icans, do hereby issue a challenge
to the Davidson College Freshman
team for a football game to be
played at the nearest convenient
date on Richardson Field, Davidson,
N. C.” Signed, ‘Coach Unger’s
Pros.” |

Both teams are in good shape for
ythe proposed conilict,"and both are"
confident of ae The “B’’ team
intends to specialize on lateral passes
and the famous Unger Spread Play.
The only ‘opinion released for pub-
lication is that of Coach “Tubby”
Hand, who is reported as having
said, ‘‘The All-Americans will win
in a breeze.”

Considerable interest has been shown
in Sigma Delta Psi, national honorary
fraternity, this fall. Although there were
no men who completed their requirements,
several lack very little of doing so.

W. J. Fraley of the Senior class needs
only to pass the rope climbing and swim-
ming tests before becoming a member
of this organization,.and J. W. Hickman,

Freshman, lacks nothing but the base-
ball throw and swim. F, E, Parker has
passed all but three, and C. W. Sample
all but four requirements.

There were forty-eight entrants this
year the majority of whom passed most
of their tests.

CAROLINA SCORES TWICE

?ittman, Lafferty, Lee, and Cathey
Star For ’Cats

Davidson's fighting Wildcats held the
powerful Tar Heels from the Univer-
sity of North Carolina to two touch-
downs Saturday afternoon on Richard-
Field. Montgomery took the ball
over both times and

son
Daniels converted
both points to make Carolina’s 14-0 vic-
tory.

Don Jackson, Carolina’s All-American
bid, found the going very rough all af-
ternoon, but occasionally gave the crowd
glimpses of the ability that has gained
him widespread recognition. However,
Paul Pittman, Davidson back, gave such
an exhibition as to be labeled ‘the out-
standing man on the fiekl.’” Paul, bur-
dened with the duties of passing, punt-
ing, and doing of the running,
thrilled the crowd 7,500 time after
time, «and he climaxed a brilliant exhi-
hition with a twisting run of fifty-tive
yards. Qn this play, Pittman seemed to
but the interference was unable
to block the last two men and he was
tackled on Carolina’s 26-yard line.

For the ‘Cats Dick Johnson played his
usual good game at guard, Paul Pittman
ran, passed, and kicked his way to glory,
and John Lee, “Teeny” Lafferty, and
Wood Burns contributed to the
splendid account the Wildcats gave of
themselves. Harry Montgomery, “Hump”
