THE DAVIDSONIAN OPINIONS MONDAY, JANUARY 25, 1993

Student Sees Soccer Enthusiasm
As a Model For the\Campus Attitude

was here to be swept away by the
magic you created.

None of us will soon, if ever,
forget the sound of a cannon-like
thud, the look of fear in a hapless
defender’s eyes, and the image of
1992’s top scorer running past the
crowd, pumping his fist or holding
his arms out to us as if to say “That
was for you, Davidson”. _

Nor will. we forget that little
blur of yellow that flew through
the air'in ways we thought only
happened in the movies, andsome-
how kept the ball out of the goal.
How many times did Alex Deegan
andour great defensive corps make
miraculous plays to keep our
dreams alive.

Ben Hayes’s headers. Iceman
Sampers’s fifth round penalty
kicks. Omli’s refusal to give an
inch - no matter what. Spear’s
ability to be everywhere. It all
added up to the greatest athletic
moment of our lives. You played
out our greatest fantasies on the
soccer field. Every week, you faced

Goliath, you\drilled him, and you
took us with you. We will keep the
memories of those days with us
ays.

And, as trivial as it sounds, I
think we could all stand to learn
from what that brief period of pride
and enthusiasm had to teach us.

Thope that perhapsin the com-
ing semester, when we start to get
down and frustrated, and when it

ever, forget .. . the image
of 1992's top scorer run-

ning past the crowd,

ing his arms out as if to

Davidson."

seems that in order to be a young,
concerned adult we have to take an
unflinching stand on everything,
fighting bitterly to the end at all
costs so that our voice is heard, ...
we can stop.

And remember what it was
then, and is now, to LIVE. Re-
member how lucky we are to be
here, young or old, together. Re-
member how easy itcan be to relax
and enjoy each other’s company.
We don’t have to drop our con-
cems or care about them any less,
but we also don’t have to get so
bogged down in work or causes
and crusades that we forget to sit
back and think about how good it
really is to be here - today.

It certainly wouldn’t be easy,
but it’s worth considering. I for
one made some friends in those
weeks that I mightnever have made
had we not stopped, cut through

' the surface, and realized that we

are all in this together - that at the
core we all havea lotaround which
to unite.

Maybe I’m alone on this, and
maybe I’m making it all up in my
head as I romanticize the past.

But maybe I’m not. Maybe
the soccer team showed us a real
light in a place we never would
have thought to look. Thanks,
guys. You did us proud.

Fear of Interracial Dating is Sometimes
Understandable, Sometimes Not

this college comes to that is watch-
ing old “Jeffersons” reruns.
There is also probably some
sort of fear of the unknown in-
volved with interracial dating.
People are more comfortable with
what’s familiar, physically as well
as culturally. And many people
just aren’t used to it. They don’t
consider people of other races be-
cause, well, it just never crosses
their minds. Try this little self-test:
what would your friends or family
think if you said, speaking of some-
one of another race, “that guy/girl

is hot”? What would you think of
someone who said that?
Davidson should try to in-
crease the number of African-
American applicants. A Phi A will
hopefully help. Students should
get involved more in groups like
SERCH (it only meets once every
few weeks for an hour; you can

take time out of your beer-guz-

zling to go). The BSC and A PhiA
need to continue to reach out to
White students, and White students
need to pay attention when they
do. And students need to discuss
racial issues more. It doesn’t help
to complain to your roommate;
Blacks and Whites need to talk to
each other, It’s not hard, once you
get over the initial apprehension.
That’s why we write this damn
article, to show that itcan be done.
Lastly, we need to try to rid our-
selves of theimpression that mixed-
race dating can’t be done. If you
like someone of another race, or
even if you just ogle their bod,
don’t let their race hold you back.

The World's Mistakes Should Serve to

the other ethnic groups in a par-
ticular country at the entire

population’s expense. Sounds alot —

like the warring factions in Soma-
lia, too, doesn’t it? These are all
examples of alack of national unity,
a quality vital to the survival and
stability of a nation.

Sooner or perhaps too much
later, we are going to have to real-
ize that if we are going to avoid the
monolithic crises that are affecting

our neighbors in the world, each of

may have to make the painful deci-
sion to forego indivdual gain for
the good of our neighbors and the
welfare of our nation. Perhaps we
could all learn from Rockdale

County (Ga.) High School’s bas-_

ketball coach Cleveland Stroud
“who gave up his team’s 1987
state title on a technicality and
then said, ‘You’ve gotto do what’s
honest and right. People forget
the scores of basketball games;
they don’tever forget what you’re
made of.’” Ain’t that the truth.

look likea silly caucasian Fu-Man-
Choo.

There you have it - my ideals
dashed to pieces.

Saddest of all, I find myself
reminiscing about “when I was a
kid...” Remember the: good ol’
days?

Phone calls were a dime.
Candybars were a quarter.

-McDonald’s had only sold 30
million.

Children got punished for not
eating their peas or coming home

from play late, not manslaughter, -
drug trafficking and rape.

Youngsters on the Courtcould
get as many beers as they wanted.

Like I said, I’m old.

Sometimes I drink coffee.
When I was four, only old people
drank coffee. Now, I realize, those
who wish to stay awake do.

I have three gray hairs.

The other day I caught myself
making that arthritic “Uhhh” sound
as I sat down. Soon I expect to be
gumming my bread and talking
about my bowels.

So if you see me shuffling
around, be kind. Respect your
elders.

Bush's Last Dirty Trick

in South America, fighters to whom
Congress had voted specifically
not to give aid. That is worse than
breaking into a building, atleaston
my governmental crimes scale.
Second, the fact that Bush
pardoned these men so close to
their trial can only lead me to sus-
pect that he feared information
brought out in the trials would lead
to his own indictment. This accu-
sation, of course, is unproven, but
is itnot unlikely that Bush, the ex-

' director of the CIA, knew about

the arms deals. Maybe, one day,
we will know.

What about Reagan? The
American public felt so comfort-
able under his grandfatherly wing
that they let him get away with

saying, “Idon’tremember.” What
was Nixon’s crime? Thathe didn’t
lie enough?

The fact is, both Reagan and
Bush got away narrowly from be-
ing dragged into the aftermath of
some highly illegal dealings which
originated in the White House.
Even the men whom we know are
guilty got away with the crime.

So why is it worse than
Watergate? After all, no Presi-
dents resigned, no tapes were
found, no one lost his cool, and
Bush downplayed the pardons like
aproon Christmas Eve. It is worse
because in America, a country
founded on the principles of gov-
emmental checks and rule of law,
some people are, in fact, above the
law.

They got away with it, and we
let them. That is the worst crime of
