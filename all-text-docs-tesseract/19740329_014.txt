spot.’’ Mitchell has: been ex-
tremely hot in the last two
weeks.

Frank was extremely
pleased with the overall play
of the club, as he felt there has
been great improvement in
the players’ performances. He
thinks the team is getting ‘‘in
the groove for the tough up-
coming matches.”

The squad opened the week
with an 8-1 shelling of Amher-
st. Allen, Quinby, and Bressler
led the team again, as each
won in three sets.

Once again, Mitchell played
exceptional tennis at the num-
ber six spot as he smashed his
opponent.

The Cats also won all three
doubles, which reassured
Frank, who was disturbed
with the losses in some
doubles matches last week.

He feels the team is getting

stronger in the lower portions
of the squad, which should be

a significant factor in the
future matches.

The Cats travel to South
Carolina tomorrow, but will
return home for a Monday
match with Duke, which is
supposed to be one of the top
powers in the Atlantic Coast
Conference. They also have a
Wednesday match at home
with Harvard.

A film of Albert Camus’ L’etranger (The Stranger) will be shown April
2, 8:30 p.m. in Love Auditorium.

Meursalt, the principal character (not the hero) of L’etranger, is like
each of us--strangers to our own lives, obsessed with the “‘absurd,’’ and
tempted by nihilism. Meursalt is condemned to death, says Camus,
““because he does not play the game...he refuses to lie.. which is what ali
of us do every day to simplify life.”

This is a rare opportunity to see this excellent and fairly recent film
starring Marcello Mastroianni. The dialog is in French with English sub-
titles. There is no admission charge for this film offered by the French
