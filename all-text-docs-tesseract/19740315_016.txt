... Streakers

going to have to arrest them,”
Hughes continued. “But we
don't care whether or not
these kids do it around the
buildings here in front of the
other students. Our policy now
is to keep out the outsiders.”’

As far as any streaking is
concerned, Lt. Hughes stated
that the police department
‘hasn't had any actual reports
of any.”

So far, streaking at David-
son has been strictly a one-
sided affair, with only men
participants in a sport that is
anything but discriminatory.
There were reports of a lone
coed braving the wilds of
sexually whetted male ap-
petites and donning the
altogether so to speak, but as
yet no substantiation is at
hand.

However, all you guys who
have fingered the remaining
shreds of Penthouse and are
looking for more tangible
results, a nameless coed has it
on good authority tht the Wat-
ts dwellers ‘‘definitely do have
a streaking plan formulated.’

Nonetheless, one can already
see signs of growing apathy.
towards the descendant of
stuffed phone booths and pan-
ty raids. Let's face it, 15 mem-
bers from Davidson does not
come close to 900 from U.N.C.,
and that may be the very
reason itself.

‘‘We just don’t have the
numbers’”’, one said. But Con-
nors came more to the point:
“The personalness of the
campus is the main reason.
We’re so small that everybody
here knows everybody else.”’

It is true that streaking
around here is an infrequent
event, and one is usually
plowed when it happens. The
streaker at the PIKA party
last Saturday night was so
gone, he ran into a wall, and
nobody seemed to notice.

The daylight streakers

struck (or is it strek?) last
' Sunday after the Delt version

of the Mud Bowl, but after
several beers, streaking was
far from an accurate descrip-
tion, and attention more or
less ran the same route.

But take heart all ye con-
cerned parents, lest ye worry
that for all the bread you shell
out to this place your son or
daughter is mindlessly idling
his time away with an au
naturel 440; Davidson is still
an institution of purpose.

‘‘We were streaking in
protest of us having any
Thanksgiving Day classes,’ a
spokesman for the group ex-
plained, *‘And if the faculty
decides to go through with it,
we plan to streak to class!”’
The only advice I can give to
them is to drop the idea; the
faculty might decide to call
their buff.

these people a sense of a
strong working team,”’ said
Terry.

“During the spring we will
also give them special
training in dealing with issues
such as sex and drugs. We'll
also be putting a big emphasis
on the honor system and
trying to find the best ways of
getting across the importance
of the honor system to the
freshmen,’ he indicated.

‘We also hope to identify
various hall counselors with
specific interests and resour-
ces, making them an_ in-
terdependent counseling

group. I think it’s very im-
portant for the hall counselors
to serve as resources to get the
freshmen involved in the cam-
pus life of Davidson,’’ Terry
said.

Davidson PIRG Hits Drugs

By CHARLES KENNON
Asst. Managing Editor

After spending most of the
year in publicity-shy resear-
ch, NC-PIRG this week began
a state-wide campaign against
the problems encountered by
‘“‘average consumers’’ in
buying prescription drugs.

NC-PIRG held news con-
ferences throughout the state
Monday to release the results
of surveys conducted on price
availability and variation for
prescription drugs. These
results are intended to support
a price-posting bill now in the
North Carolina
legislature. The bill requires
that all prices be freely given
and the 100 most common
drugs be posted in the stores.

Mac McKeithen, chair-
man for Davidson’s PIRG
branch, felt that the area of
prescription drugs is one
among many where students

Will Terry and Housing Direc-
tor Scotty Nicholls have been
considering several
possibilities. Terry  an-
ticipates that there will be
about 165 students living off
campus next year compared
with this year’s 200.

He said that if Richardson’s
basement is renovated for
next fall, it can accomodate 18
students. Fourth floor Belk
will house women students
next year, and there is a slight
possibility that the bookstore
will have to be moved before
its place in the new Union is
ready.

are able to effect serious
reform.

“The survey conducted
on prescription drug
availability showed great dif-
ferences between stores’
prices on the same drug. This
lends factual support to the
bill now in the legislature. The
people have a right to know
and that's what this bill would
do.’’ he said

Two surveys were made by
Davidson students on the
problems of buying drugs in
the Charlotte area. In the first,
in mid-February, 56 phar-
macies were telephones about
the prices for several common
prescription drugs. Thirteen
(23%) refused to give the price
out over the phone. The prices
that were given ranged from
$2.75 to $7.75 for the same
amount of the drug.

Following this, PIRG mem-
bers visited a sample of six-
teen Charlotte stores to com-
pare prices. The same
prescription of one drug
varied in cost from $1.20 to
$7.20.

McKeithen stressed the fact
that these surveys were con-
ducted without the PIRG
members identifying them-
selves as such.

While reform in prescription
drugs is a large portion of
PIRG’s activities it is not the
only one. Other projects that
PIRG is involved with include
fighting Duke Power Com-
pany’s proposed rate in-
crease, the expansion of
nuclear power plants in the
Carolinas, (especially the
Lake Norman area), and land
use.

‘Duke is a huge monopoly

and they made profits of $90
million last year. With that
kind of profit I see no
justifiable reason for a rate in-
crease of the magnitude that
they want. On Wednesday,
March 20, we will host a
debate between a represen-
tative of Duke and our own
hired staff person in charge of
investigating Duke, Bob
Hall,’’ McKeithen said.

He added that PIRG was a
strong supporter of the
original form of the Coastal
Land Management bill now in
the North Carolina
legislature, but that changes
in the bill had drastically
altered its intentions.

On this subject, McKeithen
said, ‘‘As the bill is now, with
its amendments, we cannot
support it. However, PIRG is
still vitally concerned - with
land use and management .”’
McKeithen expressed concern
over future funding of PIRG at
Davidson.

“As it stands now each
student is assessed $3 for the
support of PIRG. At the begin-
ning of this year, every
student was able to reclaim
his money. Eighty-five per-
cent of the students didn’t
reclaim it.

‘‘But now President Spencer
has changed this method, so in
the spring registration
package there will be a place
for students to check if they
want to pay for PIRG or not. I
feel that if we have to be sup-
ported in this new method
every other organization,
THE DAVIDSONIAN, Quips
and Cranks, SGA and the
others, should not continue to
be funded bv the present wav”’
