SCHOLARS

Competition For
G F. Baker Awards
Reopened For ‘S{

Professor B. D. Thompson, sec-
retary of the Committee on George
F. Baker Scholarships, announced
the opening of Baker Scholarship
competition for 1951.

From three to five boys may be
accepted from the 2,000 high schools.
and preparatory schools to which
informative circulars have been
sent. Each award is renewable from
year to year for a maximum of
four years, provided the grantee
maintains a scholastic record of
high honor and continues to give
satisfactory evidence of the develop.
ment of other qualities for which
he was selected.

In the belief that the strength of
the United States lies in the quality
of its people, and that the quality
of its people depends upon the edu-
cation they receive, Davidson Col.
lege offers these scholarships to
encourage young men of ability
to seek college training. Applicants
must furnish evidence of superior
scholastic ability, well-rounded pcr.
sonality, strength of character, and
high qualities of leadership. Neither
scholastic aptitude alone, nor ach-
ievement in extra-curricular activi-
ties alone, is sufficient.

Present Baker Scholars are:
George Bason, Alan Garrison,
Mitchell Patton, Herman Bell,

Larry Dagenhart, Bob Henry, Jim
Speed, Bob Crutchfield, Buddy La-
mon, Buford Price, Moody Smith
and Alden Williams.

Any student who knows a possi-
ble candidate is urgéd to send his
name and address not later than
February 1-to Professor B. D.
Thompson.

Beavers Make Plans
For Visiting Teams

On November 7, the first fall
meeting of the Beaver Club was
held. It was decided that a mem-
ber of the club will be with each
visiting athletic team while it is
on the Davidson campus. The idea
is to make the team feel welcome
and to improve our relations with
other colleges. Committees for each
sport were appointed. It was also
decided that the Beaver Club
would sponsor a dance during bas.
ket-ball season.

The club consists of 24 members,
12 juniors and 12 sophomores. Each
spring 12 freshmen, who have won
freshman numerals, are elected into
the group and become active mem-
bers their Sophomore year. The
Beaver Club is an underclassmen
organization, therefore when a
member becomes a Senior his mem-
bership becomes inactive. The offi.
cers of the Beaver Club are: Presi-
dent, Mac McLean; Vice-President,
Allan Strand; Secretary- Treasur-
er, Gordon Stuart. The three func-
tions of the organization are: the
senior auction, the clothing drive,
and welcoming the visiting teams.

Mock Group Offered
As Curefor Problems

The latest popular campus sug-
gestion is a system, which if in-
stalled at Davidson College, would
prove, claim its advocates, of great
benefit to the student if used prop-
erly, is the House Committee, com-
posed of one Senior or Junior from
each dormitory.

This system would be installed
by the student council to receive
and straighten out all complaints
regarding superfluous noises, jani-
tor service, lack of hot water, and
other such complaints from the
dorms. In co-operation with the
Court of Control, this committee
also would have_charge of certain
freshman regulations. One of these
which should be put into effect, is
the mailing system. Under this sys-
tem one freshman is appointed on
each floor to collect all mail on
his floor at 10:30. The mail is
then pooled and one freshman posts
it all each night to insure earl.
mailing.

With the co-operation of the stu-
dents the committee would be able
to insure better living conditions in
the dormitories. All would become
acquainted with their committee-
man in order to insure a closer
working union between the stu-
dents and the committee.

Nine Men Initiated
Into Literary Group
At Regular Meeting

The regular Monday night meet-
ing of Eumanean Literary Society
was highlighted by the acceptance
into membership of nine upperclass-
men: Robert Merrill, Sammy Hope,
Robin Hinson, Coleman Poag,
George Irvin, Ed Richardson, Fred
Holder, Hubert Cannon, and Mike
Myers. Most old members agreed
that the papers read by the initiates
were the best ever heard by the
society.

“A Dilemma of Modern Society,”
by Robert Merrill, told of the prob.
lems confronting a college boy in
love with a far away lass. Sammy
Hope's excellent short story, “Con-
trast,” depicted the pathos of an
old violinist whose daughter lay
dying. Robin Hinson, in a different
vein, told about the moonshiner's
son who came to Davidson be-
cause he had heard so much about
“That Good Old Davidson Spirit.”
In “The Automobile What Was,”
Coleman Poag reviewed the devel-
opment of the horseless ‘carriage.
George Irvin dramatized a bit of
history in “The VMI Cadets at the
Battle of New Market,” and then
Edgar Richardson educated the so-
ciety in his usual lurid manner with
a “Discussion of Style.” “Travels
By Sea,” by Fred Holder, gave
some of the author’s impressions
and experiences while serving in
the Navy. An unusual idea was
“Modern Travel”; he compared a
college student's bumming a ride
to Columbus’ sailing out into the
unknown Atlantic. The final paper,
“The How and Why of the Fire.

DISCUSSION GROUP
CONSIDERS RULES

Before an open fire in the hos-
pitable Colonial living-room of Dr.
Chalmers Gaston Davidson, a small
group of students gathered last
Sunday evening after Vespers to
thoughtfully consider the place of
rules and regulations in a liberal
arts college. This was the first of
a series of -after-Vesper discussion
groups which will be sponsored by
the Y. M. C. A. this year.

The rules and regulations ‘of sev-
eral other liberal arts colleges were
examined and compared with local
ones. There were particularly vig-
orous discussions of the cut sys-
tem and the drinking and Sabbath
observance rules. The general con-
clusion was that there is a need
for reconsideration and revision at
Davidson. Positive suggestions
were made and will be relayed
through several channels.

Any who are interested in future
discussions please watch the Da.
vidsonian announcements and the
Y. M. C. A. Bulletin board.

Davidson Band To Perform

Masquers Stage Nightly Rehearsals
Of ‘Coming “Command Decision”

In its third week of rehearsal,
“Command Decision” is being re-
hearsed each night in preparation
for the performances on November
21-22. This will be the first play
produced by the Red and Black
Masquers for the 1950-51 season.

Appearing in one of the main
supporting roles of the Red and
Black Masquers production of
COMMAND DECISION is Bill
Hollister, a member of the senior
class. Bill, a pre-med student from
New Bern, N- C., is a member of
the editorial staff of the Scripts
"N Pranks, Eumanean Literary So-
ciety, Red and Black Masquers and
Phi Delta Theta social fraternity.
Last year he served as a managing
editor of the Davidsonian. By no
means is this Bill’s first appear-
ance with the Masquers. He will
be remembered for commendable
performance in the Masquers’ pro.
duction las spring, THE MAN
WHO CAME TO DINNER, in
which he played the role of a young
newspaper editor. He has also
worked backstage on other pro-
duction last spring. THE MAN
coming to Davidson Bill played
roles in a number of plays at Mc-
Callie.

The role in which Bill will appear
in this production is that of Briga-
dier General Clifton Garnett, a me-
ticulous, virile officer in his late
thirties. Garnett, whose only ex-
perience in air war has been in

flying 2 desk in Washington, is

sent to England to warn General
Dennis, the protagonist of the play,
about extraordinarily heavy losses
which the latter has incurred in his
aerial warfare over Germany. While
in England he learns through first
hand experience that there is more
to war than desk work.

Bob Crosland, a member of the
sophomore class, will appear in the
role of Senator Maicolm. Bob, who
hails from Charlotte, is a pledge of
Phi Delta Theta social fraternity
and a member of the tennis team.
Although this is his first appearance
with the Masquers he has had act-
ing experience in high school. Just
this past summer he played a role
in Gilbert and Sullivan’s ever-popu-
lar opperétta THE PIRATES OF
PENZANCE.

Senator Malcolm, a Southern
senator from Mississippi, is a ty-
pical demagogic politician whose
eyes are always turned toward the
next election—his shallow thinking
and ornate trite phrases testimony
to this trait. Although the senator
has only a bare knowledge of what
is going on, he attempts in vain to
understand and remedy the confu-
sion; instead, he only adds to the
turmoil.

Committees have been set up
which will assist in the production
of “Command Decision.” They are
as follows: Director, Tad Currie;
Associate. Director, Prof. R. W.
Tyson; Stage Manager, Joe Matti-
son; Properties, Billy Pharr and Ru-

of the Davidson Football Band,| 7. jew members who have been

promises another unique and
entertaining halftime perform-
ance for fans at Riddick Sta-
dium this Saturday night when
the band travels to Raleigh to
support the Wildcats against
the Wolfpack of N. C. State.
It was two years ago, when
Davidson last met the Wolfpack
on its home field, that the band
first presented an entire halftime
formation in the dark, using the
colorful light displays which have
since become such a popular feature
of its drills. This formation, which
attracted a great deal of favorable
comment at the time, included the
first presentation by the band of its
beautiful “Carolina Moon’ routine.
This same formation was used by
the band at one of the home games
last year and was well received by
the home folks also.

Mr. Moore states that the drill
Saturday night will again feature
a formation done with lights and
will also include block letter sa-
jutes to both schools.

Under Mr. Moore’s direction, the
band has made very effective use
of the light formations at two of
the previous night games this year
Halftime at the P. C. game in
Clinton, S. C. was highlighted hy
a South Pacific routine done with
lights on the musicians’ feet. At
the Erskine game, the band pro.
vided an entertaining innovation
with their singing of “Over the
Rainbow,” while outlining a rain.

Le Cercle Francais
Holds First Meeting

le Cercle Francais held its first
meeting of the academic year Tues-
day evening, October 24 at the
home of Dr. and Mrs. Watts. The
meeting was officially the time of
receiving new members, after which
the program chairman, Jack Hunter,
presented a very interesting and in-
formative program.

Three of the new members, Her-
man Bell, Mac Bulgin and Frank
McCutchan gave as their initiatory
contribution the resume of three
well known French short stories.
Jack Hunter presented a glimpse
of his tour in Europe with particular
emphasis on his impressions of
France and more descriptively of
Paris. The guest of the evening was
Mr. William Hart, an alumnus of
Davidson who has had a varied
career as professor of French at
Whitman College and more recently
as a Captain in the U. S. Army
stationed in Frankfurt, Germany.
Of his experience he related pres-
ent trends in France since the re.
construction and presented a hope
ful view of France as it is endeav-
oring to take its place among the
leading nations of the day.

After the meeting was adjourned,
Mrs. Watts and Mrs. Goldiere
served delicious refreshments con-
ducive to a French social hour.

received by Le Cercle Francais are
Messrs. Mac Bulgin, Herman Bell,
Frank McCutchan, J. N. Smith, Hu.
bert Cannon, Bill Crymes, Fred
Deaton and Duke Fowler.

Erection Of Student Union
Awaits Architect's Signal

Preliminary plans have been completed for converting the
Alumni Gymnasium at Davidson College into a campus center

for student recreation and extracurricula

activity. The re-

modeling, costing approximately $200,000. probably will begin

early in 1951.

The center will be financed with
funds raised in the $2,500,000 Da.
vidson Development program.
which was successfully completed
last June. It will be the third build.
ing project begun under the pro-
gram. A new gymnasium was com.
pleted in 1949 and a church is now
under construction.

President John R. Cunningham,
in announcing plans for the campus
center yesterday, said that remodel.
ing of the old gymnasium instead of
erecting’ a new building will save
approximately $100,000 to $150,-
000. “The present building,” he said,
“is ideally located and will be ade-
quate.”

The gymnasium, built in 1914, is
just east of and behind Chambers
building. It is easily accessible
from students dormitories, class-
rooms and fraternity halls. The
36-year-old building has beer in.
spected thoroughly by construction
men and was found to be in good
condition.

A special consultant skilled in
student union constructicn report-
ed that the floor space of 20,000
square feet is well arranged to pro-
vide the facilities needed for a cam-
pus center.

The gymnasium, antiquated for
athletic purposes, will provide space
for such features as a snack bar,
banquet hall, game rooms, theater,
music and television rooms, office
space for student organizations and

meeting rooms for campus groups.

No name has yet been chosen
for the building, but construction
will begin as soon as the final plans
are drawn. Architects are now at
work and the blueprints should be
finished within thrée months.

The construction was authorized
by the executive committee of the
Davidson trustees following a rec-
ommendation to proceed immedi-
ately offered by the building and
grounds committee of the trustees.

10 MOST ‘BORING’ CLASSICS

The world’s 10 “most bor.
ing classics” have been select-
ed in a poll conducted by Co.
lumbia University Press.

Results of the poll establish
John Bunyan’s “Pilgrim's Pro-
gress” as the most boring book.
Others on the most boring
list include: Melville's “Moby

Dick,” Milton’s “Paradise
Lost,” Spenser's “Faerie
Quenne,” Boswell’s “Life of

Samuel Johnson,” Richardson’s
“Pamela,” Eliot’s “Silas Mar-
ner,” Scott's “Ivanhoe,” Cer-
vantes’ “Don Quixote,” and
Goethe's “Faust.”

1950 ‘Y’ Xmas Gitt Fund Allocated
To Betterment of Negro Housing

As most upperclassmen know,
last year the Y. M. C. A® Cabinet
voted unanimously to allocate the
1950 Christmas gift fund for the
betterment of Negro life in the
community. In a community meet-
ing last spring it was brought out
that the “Y” Fund would act as a
part of the security on loans up to
three thousand dollars, made by the
Davidson bank.

This makes it possible for those
responsible citizens who are able
to furnish ten percent of the total
loan to go ahead and build, which
heretofore could not have been
done because of the limited credit
available. The “Y” Fund is not
lent. It merely serves as part of
the security on a regular bank loan
which is covered partially by the
property itself.

At the close of school last year,
the Citizens committee reported at
the town meeting that work had
already begun; that they had fi-
nanced a house for John Heath,
and that Dr. George B. Watts had
begun construction on two other
houses. At that meeting the com.

bow with colored lights. This spec-| mittee asked that the citizens of
tacle proved so popular locally that} Davidson sign surety bonds to be

used as security in order that the

work might begin before the “Y”
Fund had been made available.

During the summer much work
has been done, and some of the re-
sults are very evident in the Ne-
gro community not far from our
own campus. In Brady's Alley, the
worst of the sections, all the out-
houses have been removed and
plumbing facilities installed in the
houses, as required by a recent city
ordinance. In the new section, Dr.
Watts has completed his houses
and seven houses in addition to
John Heath's, have been ‘financed
through the committee, and have
now been built. Only those citizens
who can furnish a lot or three
hundred dollars are eligible, and
these are carefully screened as to
integrity, reliability and earning
power. Three of them work for
the college, and the rest are em-
ployed among local plants and fac-
tories, The college has purchased
some houses in Brady's Alley, and
is repairing them in order that
some of the persons which it em.
ploys may have better living con-
ditions.

Thus the idea that was born the
day the fire siren stopped the

SIGMA UP BEGINS
ANNUAL PROJECT

Sigma Upsilon, Davidson's na-
tional honorary fraternity recogniz-
ing student literary ‘talent, held it.
second meeting of the year Thurs.
day night a week ago at the Phi
Delta Theta house. Pete Kalogridis
opened the evenitig’s program by
reading his own essay entitled
“The Dilemma.” The essay consi-
dered the paradox of war and peace
—whether the United States should
prepare for war in order to keep
the peace, or risk being subjngated
by a stronger nation. .

After a group discussion of Ka-
logridis’ essay, Mac Bulgin présent-
ed an original short story called
“The White Dress.’ The story
dealt with the disillusionment of a
young girl who idealized her lover,
only to discover that he. was “like
all the rest.” The society's poem
of the week, “A Thanksgiving
Prayer,” was written and delivered
by Gordon Scott. Hartley Hall
closed the program by presenting .
the first in a series of regular re.
ports on. the society's project for
the year—a study of the revolt of
contemporary writers against ma-
terialism. Hartley’s report provided
background material om the causes
