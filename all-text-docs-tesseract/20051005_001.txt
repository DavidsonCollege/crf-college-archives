Davidson study abroad
to be introduced in Peru

By KATIE PFEIFFER

Senior Staff Writer

Davidson is expanding its study
abroad program to include a new
location in Peru, projected to begin
in fall 2007.

_The Peru experience will begin
as a semester-long program every
other year while the college contin-
ues to weigh student interest.

“We’re very optimistic that it
[the Peru program] will be imple-
mented,” said Latin American his-
tory professor and program co-
director Jane Mangan. “It will pro-
vide an opportunity for students
with diverse abilities.”

The new program will be based
in Arechipa, a vibrant colonial city
of about one million people.

Students will live with host fam-
ilies and attend class at a local pub-
lic university, taking a regular
Davidson course load of four class-
es during the semester.

As of now, Davidson expects to
be based at San Agustin National
University, a vibrant academic
community that boasts a sprawling
campus in the city’s downtown
area.

A field visit will be conducted
later this year to confirm the site’s

Legendary librarian Park
announces retirement

By LEx1 HAMILTON
Staff Writer

Dr. Leland Park ’63 recently
announced he would retire this
summer after serving for nearly 40
years as the director of the
Davidson College library.

Park, who graduated from
Davidson with a degree in political
science in 1963, has been the
library director since 1975.

Park is only Davidson College’s
third library director in the past 99
years. Cornelia Shaw took over the
task of running the library in 1907,
and Dr. Chalmers Davidson ’28
served as the director from 1936 to
1975.

All three worked to make. the
library experience a unique, per-
sonal reflection of the integrity and

spirit that characterize the
Davidson community.

“If you’re looking for a walking
icon that represents Davidson, for
over two decades it’s been Leland
Park,” President Bobby Vagt said.
“His retirement should be.a sad-
ness milestone in the life of the col-
lege. The great challenge will be
how to draw out of his brain all of
the institutional memory.”

In his years at Davidson, Park
hired all of the current library staff
members.

“IT have been responsible for the
hiring,” Park said, “and I take full
credit. These are great people.”

Park and his colleagues work as
a single, harmonious entity in the

library.

Science majors kicked out
of academic buildings

Campus Safety enforcing 1 a.m. deadline

By MIKE TELLIS
Staff Writer

Campus Safety began enforcing
a contentious policy requiring stu-
dents to vacate academic buildings
after 1 a.m. this semester.

The administration defends this
policy, citing the high costs of
keeping buildings open for 24
hours.

“The primary rationale for the
policy is saving money, principally
utility cost,” Dean of Faculty Clark
Ross said. “ An outdated (and, thus
low) estimate of savings is nearly
$500,000 a year for all academic
buildings. Safety of students and
equipment is also another reason
for the policy.”

This policy existed in the past
but was not normally enforced if
students had entered the building
before the deadline.

Professors had previously been
responsible for enforcing the poli-
cy, but last spring, a group of sci-
ence professors asked President
Bobby Vagt to relieve them of this
duty.

HOMECOMING 2005

Seniors Emily Rodda and Jordie Poncy were crowned Queen and
King last weekend. Read about the game on page 16.

“They said that they understood
the policy and didn’t want to be
policemen,” Vagt said. “They
asked if I would take responsibility
for enforcing the policy, and I said
yes.”

Over the period of this semester,
many students have been escorted
out of academic buildings by
Campus Safety on a number of
occasions. Science students have
been especially hard hit by the
change in policy enforcement.

The science buildings afford stu-
dents with equipment and special-
ized software which are only
accessible at these locations.

Owing to time and space con-
straints, evenings and nights are
often the only times that the
resources in the science buildings
are available to the students.

There has been much correspon-
dence between President Bobby
Vagt and a number of science stu-
dents who feel strongly about this
issue.

“I know a lot of physics, chem-

Margaret Spellings

Sec. Spellings
to speak at
convocation

By SUMMERLEE WALTER

Staff Writer

Davidson College recently
announced that the United
States Secretary of Education
Margaret Spellings will speak at
its 2005 Fall Convocation.

Spellings will address stu-
dents, parents, and faculty on
October 22 at 10:30 a.m. in the
Duke Family Performance Hall.

Davidson’s principle execu-
tive staff, consisting of
President Bobby Vagt and the
deans, began the process of
selecting a Fall Convocation
speaker shortly after classes
reconvened in August.

Spellings immediately came
to mind as a topical speaker who
would not only provide insight
into the challenges and the goals
of higher education but would
provide a balance to last fall’s
speaker Marian Wright
-Edelman.

Edelman, founder and presi-
dent of the Children’s Defense
Fund, called on citizens to pres-
sure elected officials to put the
needs of children first in her
address.

Whereas Spring Convocation
focuses primarily on recogniz-
ing the year’s student and facul-
ty accomplishments, the high-
light of Fall Convocation has
traditionally been a guest speak-
er who addresses a topic of cur-
rent interest to those involved in
attaining, shaping, and support-
ing higher education.
