A REVIEW
By DAVID WELLS

For those neophyte coun
try music fans who don't
know, the Union Grove Old
Time Fiddler's Convention
is the big time. At least
that’s what they want you to
think.

Harper van Hoy and his
brother Pierce have been
promoting this festival an-
nually for the past: 47 years.
It seems they used to do it
together, until a slight dis-
agreement over the purpose
behind the whole thing split
them up. (Pierce was more
concerned about aesthetics,
Harper about economics.)
Now there are two Old Time
Fiddler's Conventions, both
in Union Grove, N.C.

Not knowing what to ex-
pect from either of them,. we
chose to patronize the larger

Scott Supports May Protest

To the Editor: \

Throtghout the next five
weeks the world community
will witness large peace de
monstrations in America.
Two have received the most
attention and publicity: the
April 24th peace celebration
sponsored by the National
Peace Action Coalition. (NP-
AC) and the May 1 observ-
ances held by the Peoples’
Peace Coalition.

Both of these celebrations
for peace are dedicated to
compelling the United Sta
tes Government to get out
of Indo-China. and to reeval-
uate its priorities along lines
of respect for life and living
at home and abroad.

There is considerable uni-
ty of purpose -between both
of these national committees,
so much so tkait to claim
that a fundamental solidar-
ify of goals exists would be
a forcefully accurate state-
ment.

The May Day committee
affirmed this unity last week
when it publicly endorsed
the April 24 rallies, while
reaffirming its intentions to
carry out the May Day plans
as previousiv scheduled. As
yet, the NPAC has not re
turned this endorsement but
has done nothing to detract
from it.

Despite this solidarity of
purpose a_ split within the
national peace movement
has come about and it’s im
plications must be dealt with
by aJl those concerned with
the direction that the move
ment is taking.

The break came about be-
cause one faction saw non-
violence as limited to legal
jurisdictional government
while the other, the Peoples’
Peace Committee saw non-
violence as covering wide
range of protests methods
from voting for the ‘out’
party to acts of civil dis-
obedience, such as blocking
transportation arteries or en-
trances to government build-
ings.

On Tuesday of last week
some 25 students committed
themselves to attending the
April 24 celebration while
only three. made firm com

~
mittments to attend the May

Day activities.

While this paltry interest
in May Day may be con-
strued as an indication of
unity within the Coalition
itself, it actually means an
alignment of members from
the Davidson Coalition with
national factions which have
no real hope or intention of
reshaping present  govern-
mental policy.

If the Peoples’ Peace Trea-
ty is what members from
both peace*coalitions con-
tend that it is, a cry for
peace from the American
people, then to limit its im-
pact to a football stadium is
fo make mockery of the de-

Jesus Freaks Promote God

By GRAY WILSON
Managing Editor

Does God have a long face?
Not for over 60 Davidson
students and a few faculty
who witness, sing, and praise
the Lord every Monday
night.

These are Davidson’s
“Jesus freaks,’’ a Christian
prayer group dedicated to
the proposition that an emo-
tional commitment to reli-
gion is a real and vital part
of the world today.

What is a typical meeting
like? After a few choruses of
“KKumbaiya’’ and ‘‘Amazing
Grace’ last (Monday night
around 10:30 in the Green
Room, the floor was opened
for comment.

Janet Earnheart, 24, from
Charlotte explained her re-
cent conversion on. Febru-
ary 8 with dancing eyes.
“T used to be on drugs, but
now I'm full of ‘God, man,
I get stoned on him all the
time. God was. really bug-
ging me, and I knew I

really needed him. He has,

mocratic plebiscite.

Those whovsign the Peace
Treaty, thereby saying that
the usual governmental chan
nels have not functioned and
should therefore be circum
vented by direct interven
tion from the citizenry, and
then attend a rally sanction-
ed by the same unresponsive
government and — protected
by police employed by said
government must surely have
failed to understand one of
their desicions.

They are either showing
their distrust of the Treaty’s
plebiscital acceptance or
they are showing some be
lief that a-government which
has refused concensus. in
past will be sufficiently im-
pressed by signs, songs, cook-
outs and marches.

man,
every-

been so‘ good to me,
it’s just happening
where.”

This testimony was met
with cries for a song, and ‘I
Have the Joy, Joy, Joy” and
followed with hearty parti
cipation.

The spotlight then fell on
the Reverand William Sher-
wood, mandolin-plucking 81-
year-old bearded Episcopal
minister from Charlotte who
some of the students called
Moses.

“I'm younger today at 81
than I was when I wads 71.
I would have died of bore-
dom long ago without Jesus
Christ. I was a tired, retired
minister, but now I’m havifig
so much fun, I want to live
a long time in the river of
God’s joy.’

George Goudy, active
in campus life, then spoke
on the nature of human know-

‘ledge as it relates to God.

“We mustn't let studying
and thinking get all in the
direction of intellect. All the
knowledge of man falls into

of the two, which happened
to be Harper’s. The four-
dollar gate fee should have
alerted us to his ‘“‘Scheiss-
Kapitalistic motives,” but
in we went, in spite of it all.

From all appearances, it
was everything it was crack-
ed up to be: the World
Series of Bluegrass.

People came hundreds of
miles to be.on hand for the
four day marathon of pickin’
and singin’ and good ol’
down-home. entertainment.

Booths and simple dis-
plays lined the Midway area,
where artists and craftsmen
peddied their handiwork to
the passer-by.

The whole scene took on
the confused incongruity of
a county-fair, rock-festival.

The one element which
seemed to bring everyone
together was the music. It
came frm every direction,
pervading the air with the
harmonious strains of twangy
country vocals and the fur-
ious banjo and mandolin
pickin’ of instrumentals, as
the “Dixie Breakdown” > or
the “‘Foggy Mountain Break
down’ (after a while, you be-
gin to realize that all ‘Break
downs’ consist of the same
variation applied to different
themes). :

The central attraction,
however, was the contest
going on inside the big cir
cus tent, which held approx
imately 20,000 people. - All
told, 200 bands were com-
peting for the first prize in
the four day event, which
culminated on Saturday.

Except for a few top con
tenders, the emphasis was
not mainly on the compet-
ition, but on the fun involved
in playing the music itself:

The lively enjoyment felt
by the musiciass communi-

a pattern under God, We
can use the knowledge of
man to go on to the strength
and dynamic of God."

The group broke up after
a few more songs. Atten-

MOSES

cated itself in their songs.
It was next to impossible to
listen and watch without
clapping and stomping along
with the beat.

As captivating as Bluegrass
music may be, after a while
it all begins to sound roughly
the same. It's really a
struggle for the unpracticed
ear to differentiate between
the Foggy Mountain Boys
and the Red River Ramblers.

In addition to that, unless
your seat happens to be up
front, it becomes impossible
to see beyond the central
aisle, which is choked’ with
lost, stoned or simply wan
dering people, none of whom
have the jntelligence to sit
down.

Consummately fatigued by
the whole thing, yet visited
by the feeling that one
should be having. a good
time, one turns to an old
stand-by: people - watching.

Every, ty pe of freak im- <
aginable is represented,
from long-hair, eyeball-
trippin’ dopers to grungy,
arrogant motorcycle crazies.
Add a few once and future
fraternity men from Western
Carolina University and a
strong delegation of dirt
farmers and one has an idea
what the crowd looks like.
Frightening.

Harper van Hoy's Fiddle
Festival combines the best
and the worst of two worlds.
On the one hand, the Blue
grass music played béth, in
the tent and at the camp-
sites has to rate as some of
the best, but the atmosphere
in which it is performed is
nothing but authentic Amer
ican -carnival and tourist
trap, 1971.

Mebbie’ nex’ year Tl
gon down ‘n see what ol’
Pierce has. got to offer ..

's Glory
dence has grown steadily
since ‘the beginning of the
school year, and this meet-
ing included several — stu
dents and one of the faculty

from Salem College.
