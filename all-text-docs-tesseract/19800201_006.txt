‘and aie at Hurtaievitle prison

By KENT-DYER
. Staff Writer

Several years ago a group of
Davidson students, under the
auspices of junior Minor Sin-
clair and the Davidson
Y.M.C.A., began visiting the
Huntersville Prison. At that
inside the compound, and bas-
ketball was the name of the
game. Since then there have
been a lot of changes. Junior
Rend Malone has taken charge
of the program, visitation privi-
leges have been extended to
women, and the program has
expanded to include an empha-
sis on counseling and tutoring
the prisoners. Even the basket-
ball program is on the upswing,
although Malone concedes that
Davidson still takes a pretty
bad beating on the Huntersville
court. ir

The program is primarily
made up of students in the ‘“Y”
Outreach Committee who have
agreed to spend a couple of
hours every. week working in
Huntersville. Minister to Stu-
dents Rush Otey is also active
as a faculty advisor and Mathe-
matics professor Kay Smith has
recently become involved as
a tutor.

Sinclair explains that there
are four separate areas of ser-
vice with which students may
become involved. The first is
visitation. This is a time when
students get a chance to talk
with the prisoners, play back-
gammon, or ‘get run to death on
the court.

The second aspect of the
program, one that is just get-
ting started, is tutoring.
Malone explained that although
many of the prisoners are quite
intelligent, few have progressed
past the equivalent of a ninth
grade education. For those who
are interested, Malone and Sin-
clair have tried to supply books
and private instruction. The
social sciences, sociology, and
psychology have turned out to
be the most popular areas of
interest. However, Dr. Smith is
working. with several inmates
interested in mathematics.
Many of the requests are un-
usual or bizarre. Sinclair recall-
ed one man who had a burning
desire to study pathology. Cad-

avers were out of the question
(although it might have been
possible to supply him with
decapitated-rats from Dr. Lam-
mers’s physiology lab), but
Sinclair did manage to round up
several textbooks.

The third area, one, that
Malone has spearheaded him-
self, is a Christian fellowship
group at the prison. Each
Saturday Malone makes himself

available to prisoners wi are |

struggling with their faith, or
who just want someone to talk

with individually. ~

The last area involves helping
prisoners who are coming up for
parole make the transition back
into a job: One of the precondi-
tions for parole at Huntersville
is that the inmate“secure em-
ployment. This is alfnost im-
possible unless he has some
friends to work with on the
outside. Sinclair and Malone
spend much of their time trying
to.meet this particular need. by
taking prisoners out on after-
noon passes. So far they have
been able to relocate two, men in
jobs with former employers.
Opportunities in this area of
work are limited, however, since

one must have first completed.
at least twenty-five hours of .

time on the yard before being
eligible for temporary custody
of the prisoners.

Sinclair describes the purpose
of the prison program as being
twofold. The first goal involves
rehabilitation of the prisoner,
by helping him learn useful
skills, and, more importantly,
by building up his self confi-
dence—a hard task for a man
staring at bars all day.

This lethargy, an unwilling-
ness to help oneself or be helped
by others, is the biggest prob-
lem at Huntersville, according
to Malone. ‘‘Most of the prison-
ers are serving sentences for
misdemeanors related to rob-
bery. However, they all come
from poor backgrounds where
just making ends meet is a
struggle. Now they have lost
their jobs, their rights, and are
crowded together (all 160 of
them) into two large rooms with
nothing to do but watch tele-
vision all day. It’s no wonder
they have no desire to help

really cares, someone to offer.

them encouragement, or just

Malone admits, . however,
that developing friendships at
the prison is no easy matter. On
dreary days it is almost impos-
sible to get anyone outside for
basketball. ‘‘It’s times like
these that I have to go up on the
dormitory block and stir the
guys out of bed.’

Malone mentioned that the -

two most important character-
istics a person needs are bold-
ness and consistency. ‘‘The
prisoners naturally have a short
memory, and unless you make a
point to’ bé there each week
they will forget about you and
not show up. when you arrive.
Only by consistently being

available can you prove your

confidence in them whe help the .
prisoners acquire confidence'in ,

themselves.”
The second purpose of the
‘program involves “getting in
touch” with those from a differ-

ent background who are less 4

fortunate than ourselves. Sin-
clair argues ‘that it is important
to see the uncomfortable condi-
. tions of prison life so that we
can be knowledgeable enough to

help fight for reform. According —

too Sinclair, there is a severe
lack of public interest in rehab-
ilitation in the country today.
There are no active prisoners’
lobbying groups in Washing-
ton, and the public’s only
concern seems to be getting the
criminal off the street.

The most frequent question
asked by students is ‘““What can
I talk about?’’ Both Malone and
Sinclair agree that finding the
right things (or just anything)
to say is sometimes a struggle
on one’s first trips to the prison.
But they added that once you
are able to accept the prisoners

-—as people with interests similar -

to yours, the biggest hurdle is
over. From there on in, mutual
learning and understanding can
begin.

The Y.M.C.A. Prison Pro-
gram is something that, to be
effective, involves a time com-
mitment. It takes time to
dissolve the initial barriers that
block communication. But the
personal rewards are many and
there are several areas of service
within the program in which it
is possible to become involved.
The program has become popu-
lar on campus, involving over
fifty people last fall. If you
think you might be interested in
working with visitation or tu-
toring contact Rand Malone or
Minor Sinclair. i
