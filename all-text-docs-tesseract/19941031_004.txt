THE DAVIDSONIAN

Refrigerator in Union
replaces Cafe as
weekend food option

By Matthew Eirich

It’s a quarter to nine on a Fri-
day night, and you have the
munchies. You don’t have wheels
to get into Cornelius, or you don’t
want to deal with the messy Friday
evening traffic. Your search for
sustenance in your room comes up
empty. The situation looks bleak.
Whatcan you do? Simple: raid the
fridge in the Union.

Responding to this exact situ-
ation, the SGA and the Union Cafe
have established a small “refrig-
erator” where students can buy

snack items such as sandwiches,
juices, danishes, muffins, and
candy, according to Union Cafe
Manager Julie Mills.

The SGA was concerned that
students had no place to buy food
on campus between the time the
Cafe closes at seven and the Out-

post opens at ten. Now, students
can purchase snack items from the
cooler located in front of the Union
desk. Students cannot use their
Cat cards to make purchases from
the cooler.

The need for the cooler arose,
Mills explains, because it is “very
hard to find students willing to
work late” on Friday and Saturday
nights. This forced the Cafe to
close .and left students without a
place to eat.

The Union Cafe first brought
out the cooler two weeks ago.
“Business was pretty slow the first
weekend, but much more business
came out of it the second week-
end,” says Mills. Mills is looking
for more business in the future.

The Union Cafe may estab-
lish a larger cooler if warranted by
student demand.
