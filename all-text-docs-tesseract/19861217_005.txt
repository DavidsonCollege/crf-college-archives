College Bow! matches played,Prague and Cough go on

By MARK CHEN

On Monday night the last of
the semifinal matches were played
out in the College Bow! Intramur-
als. The previous matches had left
six teams still in the race for the
College Bow! Championship: De-
fenestration of Prague;
kaphobic Heteroclites; Kenneth,
What is the frequency?; Mindless
Vegetables, Section VIII and
Turn Your Head and Cough. Of
the six,, Defenestration of Prague
and Turn Your Head and Cough
were still undefeated: The two
teams left after Monday would go
to the final playoff. They would
be decided on the basis of double-
elimination.

In the 900 Room, Kenneth,
What is the Frequency? took on
Section VIII. Kenneth, What is
the Frequency was playing under
a handicap, with their captain
junior Beth Parker away in Scot-

Di-

wre.

land. The team had tried to solve
the problem with a novel recruit-
ment. Before the match, they had
talked to John Savarese, head of
the Computer Services Center and
holder of a Ph.D. from Princeton.
He had agreed to play for their
team on Monday. Because he was
taking courses at Davidson, the
team’ captain argued that Dr.
Savarese was a__ student.
Savarese’s elgibility. was firmly
denied by Dr. Hansford Epes.
KWIF would have to play the
match without his services.

The first half finished with a
tie at 105 points. Section VIII was
ably led by juniors Shane Meeks,
its captain, and Danny Michaelis.
Meeks won a toss-up for Section
VII with his knowledge of Duran
Duran. The second half saw a
dramatic tumaround. KWIF
pulled into a decisive lead from

the efforts of sophomore John.

Nohow and Contrariwise

Annen and Joe Louderback, a
freshman with no College Bowl
experience. K WIF won on a score
of 225 to 110.

In.the Morrison Room, Di-
kaphobic Heteroclites took dn the
Mindless Vegetables. The match
was extremely close. DH won,
but only by a razor thin margin of
155 to 145. The Mindless Vegeta-
bles were out of the race.

The next round had the De-
fenestration of Prague against
Turn Your Head and Cough. De-
fenestration of Prague is a team
that has played before in the intra-
murals. It is rich with proven vet-
erans such as seniors Ted Davis
and Dudley Beil. Another strong
point is its captain, junior Buddy
Martin. Turn Your Head and
Cough also had the benefit of old
players in seniors Julian Wright
and Fred Higgins. The matchup
was even, but DP won with acom-

fortable edge of 195 to 120. The

-victory ensured DP of a playoff

berth.

At the same time, DH was tak-
ing on KWIF. The match finished
with a low score, DH winning
against KWIF at 130 to 80. KWIF
was also out. DH moved on to
another match which would de-
cide the opponent of DP in the fi-
nals.

TYH&C and DH met in the
900 Room. TYH&C took an early
and almost decisive lead in the
first half. Sophomore John Hutch-
inson on TYH&C helped them the
most in this effort. DH fought
back hard and put the game back
up for grabs. TYH&C still won on
a score of 200 to 155.

Defenestration of Prague and
Turn Your Head & Cough are now
set for the final matchup. Di-
kaphobic Heteroclites will have to
comfort themselves with. third

place. With no losses, Defenestra-
tion of Prague would have to be
beaten twice by Turn Your Head
& Cough if they are to be.denied
the title. The championship round
will probably take place on the
second Monday after Christmas
break: Both teams should check
the College Bowl Corner in the
Union for details.

As usual, all the teams in the
playoffs had a high amount of tal-
ent. For those players who may.
want to be on the Davidson Col-
lege Bowl team, they should wait
till next year. At some time the in-
vitations will go out for talented
players spotted throughout the
intramurals. A player who was not
in the playoffs may still get a bid.
Try-outs will be held to fill-at least
two or three of the positions on the
team. The openings are there, so
everybody should be ready.

MORE’ PEOPLE ALIVE TODAY
THAN PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIED.

Can you believe it? That means that the |

odds are better than even that each and
every person reading this newspaper is
alive.

It means that more than 50 percent of
all people ever have lived forever — so
far. In other words, if the odds are any in-
dication — and I do believe they are —

you have a pretty good stab at immortal-
ity.

The most disturbing result of such an
unlikely event occurring, of course, is the
inevitable confusion that will occur at re-
tirement home dances. The band will
have to be able to play Glenn Miller as

’The advantage for Phil, as his gnarled
hands roll his wheelchair slowly towards
the microphone, is that his audience will
be just as bald as he.

Another disturbing result of what I
like to call the immortality thing is the
way busses will change. At the very back
of the bus will be a little sign which reads,
“Please Reserve These Seats For- Junior
Citizens.” The seniors, however, will
play scant attention to the juniors. As I
see it, gangs with names like the Red-
woods will appear whose sole mission
will be to terrorize youngsters. Traveling
in rocket-powered wheelchairs, the

bands of hoary killers will terrorize inno-

Kid: Who me? Uh nothin’.

Pruneskin: How ’bout you play me
some shuffle-board.

Kid: Um, I better go, I gotta play uh
football.

Pruneskin: Football, huh? (spits)
Sounds healthy?. Sure you wouldn’t
rather play a little canasta?

Kid: I think Pll leave now. (But be-
fore the kid can go the gang gives him the
treatment which, suffice it to say is an
ugly episode involving Metamusil).

In response to the increased violence,
there will be commercials on TV that say
things like, “Be nice to kids; they’ve

got — well — inexperience.” Some of

the more enlightened oldsters will talk

what was once known as the afterlife.
Quite simply, people will stop going to
Heaven and Hell. The seats of eternal
damnation and bliss will be relegated to
handling the inevitable overflow of the
seat of eternal regular-old-stuff.

But the change I most look forward
to — the one thing that will make life
worth living — better than the handicap-
ped parking lots, better than the cross-
word puzzle emporiums, better, even,
than being able to take my own blood
pressure and say “hmm, no change,” will__ |
be the most magical of gifts that can
accompany immortality: no more health

food.
