Frist Circulates Petition
Urging Draft Exemption

A petition urging that draft
exemption be granted for civil-
ian service such as VISTA,
Teachers Corps, and the Peace
Corps. is being circulated by
Tom Frist.

The ‘main contention is that
civil service in organizations
such as the Peace Corps can be
just as valuable to our country
and to individuals as military
service.

However, many persons are
being discouraged from applying
to these organizations because
they would have to complete
military obligations after their
civilian service. Some Peace
Corps workers have even been
drafted while serving in Viet-
nam.

“The foremost objection to a
petition such as this one,”’ stat-
ed Frist, “is that organizations
like the Peace Corps would be
ruined by those seeking to avoid
the draft.

“Selection for these organiza-
tions is very stringent, however,

and an effort to avoid the draft:

would probably be detected.
Even those who would apply for
this reason could make positive

accomplishments, and a job like

this might change them.”
Civilian service would provide
an opportunity for those who
feel a duty to their country and
yet who feel that the United
States’ involvement in Vietnam

is immoral.

The fact that Davidson is
southern, conservative, and in-
volved with the ROTC Program
may keep some from signing the
petition. Frist said.

Tt is not the number of signa-
tures which is important, how-
ever, but the percentage of the
student body who sign. A simi-
lar petition may be sent to the
faculty later because of the in-
terest that they have shown.

Students Vote Hike

For Social

Davidson students have indi-
cated their willingness to pay a
higher social fee in order to get
better entertainment for concert
and dance weekends.

Changes

Approximately 70 per cent of
the 500 voting in a referendum
of the Social Council and the
Union last week gave their ap-
proval of a proposal to rafse the
social fee five dollars a semes-
ter, according to Social Council
Chairman David Jennings. ‘

About 450 voted in chapel
March 2, Jennings said. A num-
ber of those absent or not vot-
ing in chapel were polled this
week. The final tally was 350 to
150.

Final decision in the matter

flies with the executive commit-
tee of the Board of Trustees.

(Jennings said he had no idea

FOR NEXT WEEKEND

The Poro-Seco Singers will usher in the spring season
by appearing on campus for Concert Weekend next Saturday.
The concert will be from 8 until 10 p.m., in Love Audl-
forlum and the Union will then sponsor another hungry d,
featuring folk-singers Steve Gillette and Raun MacKinnon.

when the committee would take

: | action.

At present each student pays

_}a $30 social fee, $15 a semester.

The aim of an increase, Jen-
nings said, would be *‘essential-
ly to get better entertainment.
The best groups are raising
their prices, and getting them.”
he said. ‘‘We want to stay in the

‘| bidding.”

The Social Council. which this
year used about two-thirds of the
social funds, puts on nine con-
certs each year — one for each
of four concert weekends and
Homecoming and two each for
Mid-Winters and Spring Frol-
ics.

Jennings would not commit

himself on specific groups or

fees that the council would ar-
range if the proposed hike is ap-
proved also by the executive
committee. ‘It's just impos-
sible to predict."’ he said.

He did say, however, that with
additional funds the council
could conceivably once or
twice’* get groups in the $4-5,000
range, cuch as the Lovin’ Spoon-
fuls and the Four Tops.

Faculty ue 7
Approvat
Required

Social affiliation with fraterni-
ties would be offered to all who
participate in rush under an
IFC-passed plan to be presented
by the Fraternity Affiliation
Committee to the faculty.

Upperclassmen would he al-
lowed to participate in rush.

The social affiliation would be
on a rotating basis, with a min-
imum of two months to be spent
at any one fraternity, but allow-
ing the affiliate to remain at
one fraternity as long as he
wishes.

The proposal would guarantee
to every rushee at least: six sug-
gested date cards, at least two
redates and at least one invita-
tion to social affiliation.

Bids would be of two types. A
Type A bid would offer the
a permanent basis or pledgeship.
rushee either social affiliation on

A Type B card would allow a
rushee to become a social af-
filiate under an “optional rotat-
ing plan.”

ROTATION

The optional rotation plan
would allow a rushee to become
a social affilate, but not neres-
sarily on a permanent basis or
at the fraternity of his choice.

However, the rushee would be
as closely’ matched as possible
with a list of his preferences.

At two-month intervals, the ro-
tating affiliate would have the
option of requesting another fra-
ternity. :

According to the committee's
comments, which accompany the
proposals, ‘‘Social affiliation in-
creases the chances of a non-fra-
ternity man receiving a bid after
the formal rush period, for he
has an opportunity to overcome
any initial unfavorable impres-
sions.”

The proposal was placed in
faculty boxes by the committee

REPEATED RUSH

The plan would allow a stu-
dent to redeclare himself for
rush each year, and the IFC
would guarantee him social af-
filiation for the following two se-
mesters.

The committee. which was
composed of eight fraternity
members, one independent, Cov-
ington, and Jim Terry. assistant
dean of students, did its work
under the impetus of faculty ac
tion of _ May. 1966, which re-
quired that fraternities initiate
a program of social affiliation
for all freshmen who wanted it.

Rush parties and the rush
schedule would remain the same
as before. The limitation on par-
ty attendance would remain at
one visit per fraternity for dates
and two for redates.

PREFERENCES

After the last redate party,
the rushee will submit to the
IFC a list of his six preferred
fraternities in order of prefer
ence.

All rushees will receive either
Type A or Type B bids: the
matching of Type B will be done
by the fraternity presidents.

The list of pledges and social
affiliates would be published
Friday night of rush.week, but
no distinction would be made in
it between pledges and social
affilates.

The committee commented on
Type A bids that it would “great-
ly reduce any connotations of
second-class citizenship in that
even the man receiving a bid
may choose social affiliation,
and all invitations are issued si-
multaneously.””

Council Votes To Back
Athletic Subsidization

By BOB DUNHAM
Staft Writer

The Student Council took a
stand in the current controversy
over subsidations of athletics
Monday night by adopting a
statement which favors a sub-
sidized athletic program.

After much discussion and de-
bate the council, by a vote of 8
to 2, adopted the statement pro-
posed by John Fagg which
reads: ‘We feel that the athletic
system as it now stands at Da-
vidson College plays an impor-
tant role in the life of the col-
lege. We further feel that the
elimination of our present ath-

Hollander To Replace

Entremont In Concert |

Lorin Hollander, a 22-year-old
pianist of world renown. will
perform tonight at 8:15 in Love
Auditorium as the second con-
cert in the current Artist Series.

Hollander will replace another
pianist, Phillipe Entremont, who
was originally scheduled to ap-
pear. Entremont fell and frac-
tured his wrists earlier this
week.

A graduate of the Juilliard
School of Music, Hollander re-
cently returned from a world
‘our with the Cincinnati Sym-

phony, during which he received
rave reviews and numerous ova-
tions for his performances.

The tour reached many cities
of Asia and Europe. including
Athens, Tel-Aviv, Hong Kong,
Singapore, Manila, Tokyo, Tai-
pei, and Seoul.

The New York Times pro-
claimed Hollander as “‘the out-
standing pianist of his genera-

tion.” The paper went on to laud |

his performances saying, ‘‘his
intellect and musicality match
his prodigious technique.”

letic system would prove to be
very detrimental to the college.
Therefore we call for a continua-
tion of subsidized athletics at
Davidson College.”

The discussion centered around
the question of whether the pres-
ent system places a financial
burden on the college. This was
the central issue at the preced-
ing meeting, and discussion at
that time was postponed until
the figures could be obtained.

At the request of the council
President Chuck Matthews and
counci! member Fagg. repre-
senting opposing sides in the dis-
cussion, interviewed Robert Cur-
rie, college business manager.
They presented the results of
this interview to the council
Monday evening.

According to Fagg, the fig-
ures given by Currie ‘“‘don’t show
that much.” Both Matthews and
Fagg agreed that due to various
classifications of funds used in
l the athletic program. ‘‘it’s al-
| most impossible to determine
how much the athletic program
costs."

During the meeting Fagg com-
mented, ‘‘I feel that the figures
show that it (subsidized athlet-
ics) helps, but then Chuck (Mat-
thews) has just as many points
for his side."* He went on to say
‘that, “‘there are just too many
questions here. It will take a
year to solve the question.”

After the report on the un-
yielding interview with Currie.
the Council set about to discuss:
the proposed recommendation.
The argument was somewhat
unbalanced, since several of the
members opposed to the recom-
mendation were absent from the
meeting.

Matthews,. one of the oppon-
ents, criticized the present pro-
gram and offered some “hypo-.
thetical. suggestions’ for a suit-
able replacement. saying. “‘We
could have emphasis placed on
various physical education pro-
grams rather than spending our
money on just eight per cent of
the student body.”’

“So many things could be im-
proved with that money. For ap
proximately the same cost we
could extend the athletic pro-
gram to more sports and more
students,.’’ said Matthews.

In opposition to this idea, Wil-
liam Rikard stated that. in his
opinion, ‘it's not accurate to say
that 92 per cent of the student
body doesn't benefit from the
current program.” He pointed
to the rise in student interest in
the athletic program since the
introduction of subsidized ath-
letics.

Rikard further said that a ma-
jority of the students ‘‘want to
maintain our current level of
competition." He stated that
