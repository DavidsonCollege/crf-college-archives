Ba CASKIE NOWELL 32.

What a beating the ole boy took on
the Rose Bowl game .. . predicted a
walkover for Stanford's Indians ...
vidiculed the idea of Columbia in the
Bowl’... but do We apologize ... and
are we proud of the boys from Morn-
ingside Heights ... they put the East
back in the limelight . . . swell going.

Cliff Montgomery and Al Barabas
in particular made life miserable for
the Westerners on the afternoon of
New Year's Day. They took those
heavy coast boys and showed them
what a smart Eastern eleven could do.
We still think Duke would have given
Stanford fits, though.

The Davidson basketball team has
had indifferent success to date, but
appears much improved over last
yeags quint. Captain Harris, a sharp-
shooter ‘of no mean ability, hasn’t hit
his stride yet, but should be in the
thick of it for the pre-examination
campaign that the Wildcats are enter-
ing. Hugh Yelverton’s splendid play
at guard has called forth many favor-
able comments. John Lafferty has
shown much improvement, and is run-
ning up a nice scoring total. But the
season’s surprise is “ Big Jim” Morgan,
rangey grid star, who has shown such
splendid work at center that the
scribes are calling him the backbone of
Davidson's defense.

The varsity dropped a game to the
“White Phantoms” of the University
of North Carolina the past Saturday
evening in the Céntral High gym in
Charlotte by a 38-23 score. This is a
great improvement over last year,
when the Tar Heels bumped the lo-
cals 58-16. Courtney Ross, at center,
bagged eight points to lead the Wild-
cat scorers. Aitken was outstanding
for Carolina.

The freshman quintet looked good
in a couple of early season games,
both of which they won by decisive
margins. Peabody, Quick and Gracey
look especially good, and a host of
good material is being steadily devel-
oped under the capable training of
Coach Bruce Peabody, former David-
son star.

The varsity grapplers hit-the road
this week with a rather stupendous
task ahead of them, that being the
encountering of Washington and Lee
and V. M. I. on successive nights.
These two Virginia schools have long
been prominent in the wrestling world
and will put out excellent teams this
year. However, Davidson has a very
powerful organization, and it’s a toss-
up, so pick anybody you want to. A
split is the best bet from where we
see it.

Monday the Wildcat basketeers took
on Duke, and, as this column went to
press, the results of the game were
unknown. The Blue Devils have a
splendid five, and if young Connie
Mack, son of the A’s great pilot, comes
through, they will be well up in the
conference standings. As a prognosti-
cator, it becomes my unpleasant duty
to predict a close game, that should
go to the speedy Dukes.

Looking around among the neigh-
boring schools, both Carolina and Duke
appear to have outstanding teams, and
as far as this state is concerned, are
in something of a class by themselves,
Duke trampled Wake Forest’s Deacons
rather severely in the opening “ Big
Five” encounter. Clemson has been
licked by Duke, North Carolina, and
N. C: State. South Carolina opened
with a bang, sinking Presbyterian Col-
lege, 84-9. This comes pretty close to
being something of a record, and
serves as a warning that the Game-
cocks are out for that conference title
again. ;

N. C. State is to be congratulated
upon securing Heartley “Hunk” An-
derson as coach. The former Notre
Dame mentor, ja pupil of the late
Knute Rockne, knows plenty of foot-
ball, and knows how to teach it. His
Ramblers showed what they had in
that Jast great game, when they blast-
ed Army’s perfect season by submerg-
ing the Cadets, 13-12, in a thriller. An-
derson has good potentialities in his
material at State, and the Red Terrors
are a team to be watched next season.

COLUMBIA LIONS
UPSET STANFORD
WITH 7-0 SCORE

New Yorkers Triumph Over Un-
suspecting Indians in Rose
Bowl Classic

MUD SLOWS PLAY

Carries Ball Over in
Second Quarter

Barabas

Surging through a drizzling, dis-
heartening rain, the roaring Lions of
Columbia University were sea lions
January 1 when they splashed their
way to a clear-cut and surprising vic-
tory over the Stanford football team,
7-0, in the annual Tournament of Roses
classic at Pasadena, Calif.

The game brought to a close a sea-
son replete with reverses, with this
probably the greatest upset of them
all,

The Lions battled their way to a
one-touchdown lead in the second
quarter, and then four times thrust
back the furious onslaught of the pow-

erful Stanford backs in a_last-half
struggle.
The Californians gleaned 16 first

downs to six for the New Yorkers, and
gained 272 yards to 114 for the Lions.
Stanford had six scoring chances; Co-
lumbia had three,

Then the visitors held their lead in
the face of the same powerful attack

that only two months before had
tripped the mighty Trojans of South-
ern California.

Fumbles and penalties contributed to
stopping the Indian drives, but the
Lions were always on hand to take

advantage of every break. They
played smart football. e

J
The Columbia score came after

Montgomery had thrown a pass from
the 41-yard line to Tony Matal,-Lion
Gids The ball then rested on the 17-
yard stripe. On the next play, Barabas
fumbled, but recovered for a half-yard
loss. Montgomery then took the ball
from center, wheeled in a deceptive
reverse and handed it to Barabas, who
loped across the goal line.

Davidson Cagers Meet
Lenoir-Rhyne Tonight

Wildcat Quint Will Battle State
Friday Night

Tonight the: Davidson College bas-
ketball team will play the strong Le-
noir-Rhyne team. As this goes to-press
the place of the hardwood battle is
yet undecided. The strength of the
Lenoir-Rhyne team is unknown be-
cause they have not played any teams
that Davidson has battled. This game
was originally scheduled for the local
court.

Friday night the Wolfpack from N.
C. State will invade the lair of the
Davidson Wildcat. State tamed the
Tigers from Clemson in a nip and
tuck battle at Raleigh to come into a
tie with North Carolina and Duke for
leadership in the Southern Conference.

The Wildcats, up against practically
the same team which overwhelmed
them last year, will be out for a try
at revenge when they meet State on
the twelfth.

Although they have not shown much
against superior strength so far this
year, Davidson's cagers hope for bet-
ter days with the improved team which
they will put on the court in these
contests.

Intramural Boxing
Training Commences

Intramural boxing classes, under the
direction of Captain Norton Pritchett,
were begun last Monday afternoon
and will be conducted teach week day
at 5 o'clock, except Saturdays.

In order to avoid congestion on the
main floor of the gymnasium, the
classes will be held-upstairs... At-the
end of several weeks’ training—prob-
ably in the latter part of February—
a tournament will take place in which
boxers of the different weights wili
compete with others in their own class.

Wildcat Cagers Are No Match for
Skillful White Phantoms

North Carolina’s mighty “ White
Phantoms” breezed into Charlotte last
Saturday night, and turned back a
fighting Wildcat five from Davidson
College in the Central High gymnasium
by a 38-23 score, Aitken, Carolina for-
ward, led the scoring with 10 points.

At no time were the Tar Heels head-
ed, running up a 17-3 lead early in
the game, and leading 21-10 at the in-
termission. The ’Cats put up a dog-
ged scrap, but were no match for the
speedy Carolinians. Ross led the Da-
vidson scorers with 8 points, and Har-
ris was next with 6.

’Cat Wrestlers Begin

Season with W&L, VMI

Davidson Hindered in First Tilt
by Loss of Sprunt, Potter

The Davidson grapplers open their
1934 season by encountering two par-
ticularly formidable foes, when they

take on Washington and Lee and V.
M. I. on successive nights this week-
end. Both matches will be held in

Lexington, Va.

Davidson will _put-a-good mat organ-
ization on the floor both nights, as
the Wildcats boast a galaxy of letter-
men from the very successful 1933
team, which was undefeated in North
Carolina, though they dropped deci-

sions to Franklin and Marshall and
W. and L,

On Friday night Captain Charlie
Fort will Jead his wrestlers against

the Generals of Washington and Lee,
a school famous for its fine wrestling
teams. Last season the Minks trimmed
the Wildcats, 22-8, on the local mat,
and the Davidson lads’ are out to
avenge that defeat. The meet should
be close, although two of Davidson's
most potential wrestlers will be out
to injuries. Both Potter and
Sprunt will not be able to wrestle.
Sprunt will probably be out the rest
of the season, but Potter is expected
to be all right for the next meet.

due

On the following night the Cadets
of Virginia Military Institute will be
met. This is another hard match for
the 'Cats. Davidson and V. M. I. did
not meet in wrestling last season, but
the Cadets have quite a reputation in
the world of grapplers, and a. close
match is to be expecteth,

Coach Unger has been putting his
Davidson proteges through a series of
stiff workouts ever since November,
and he held trials for the team last
Monday. He has worked hard with
the boys and in spite of injuries, an-
other successful season can be looked
forward to.

teams,

The first of these games against the
Kannapolis “Y” was won by the local
quint, 43-30, and an account of it has
already appeared in this paper.

The ‘Cats lost the second game, a
hotly contested overtime encounter
against the Statesville Red Shields, on
the latter’s floor. The Red Shields
boasted four former Davidson stars in
their line-up, West, Wagner, Calhoun,
and Mills, and won 38-33. In a return
the Wildcats retaliated and
licked the independents 39-33 on. the
Davidson court.

Statesville, the Wildcats met and de-
feated in Gastonia a team, from the
Gastonia American Legion Post. The
score was 35-22, with Captain Charlie
Harris leading the Wildcat attack with
12 points. The Dallas All-Stars licked

Release Statistics
On Football Season

Johnny. Mackorell, Ace Back,
Leads Mates in Scoring
Attack

When the count had been completed
on the averages for the season for the
Wildcat football team and its oppo-
nents as a unit, it seemed that by ac-
tual statistics Davidson had to yield
precedence to its foes in almost every
department of the game during the
1933 football year.

This, in’ almost direct disagreement
with the fact that Davidson. won six
of her games, while losing only two,
shows a point in favor of the tradi-
tional fighting Wildcat spirit, which
refused to permit its perhaps heavier
and more powerful opponents to ad-
vance when they reached that place
inside the 20-yard line.

The statistics show, however, that
Davidson led her opponents in the de-
fensive field in all departments, which
again speaks of the effort put out by
Davidson players and their good spirit.
As for the competition among the
backfield of the Davidson team, if it
might be called competition, the sta-
tistics show that Wildcat Johnny
Mackorell led the scoring attack, fol-
lowed closely by his two running
mates, Wingfield and Hutchins. To-
gether these three accounted for over
900 of the 1,325 yards made by the
Davidson team during the season.
In fact, the honors of the season
were almost entirely taken by these
three backfield flashes!» Mackorell,
with an average for the season of four
yards a try, led the running attack,
followed closely by Hutchins with 3.3
yards a try. Paul Pittman, brilliant
sophomore back, who played only in
four contests, had the best average of
all, 4.6 yards, but could hardly be reck-
oned along with the others due to his
lack of playing time.

Besides his good average in the field
of running, Mackorell, Davidson's can-
didate for probable “AI” honors in
1934, also“led prominently in the sev-
eral other fields in which he partici-
pated. He had an average for the
season of 35 yards a try on his punts.
His passing and his field generalship
were a joy to beholders.

It is notable to see how clean a
game of football the Davidson team
played. In comparison to the total
number of yards received in penalties
by her opponents, 303, Davidson in-
curred a total more of than 100 yards
fewer penalties.

The statistics as a whole are as fol-
lows:

DEFEATED. 40-35
BY DUKE CAGERS

But Fail to Overcome Blue
Devils

TRAIL 22-18 AT HALF

Thompson of Duke Leads Scor-
ing with 13 Points

Catching an unexpected tartar, the
highly touted Duke University quint
was hard pressed to nose out a fight-
ing Davidson five, 40-35, in the Char-
lotte High gym last Monday night.

The Blue Devils were off to an early
lead, and at one time were on top,
10-3. However, the Wildcats came
back strongly, and at intermission the
Dukes held a bare 22-18 edge. Com-
ing back in the second half, the Da-
vidson boys shot from all angles, and
were leading 28-24, when their main
defensive cog, “ Big Jim” Morgan, was
removed from the game on personals.
With young Connie Mack getting the

tip, from here on the Dukes came
through to win.

Davidson To Engage
Nine Grid Opponents

Captain Norton G, Pritchett, direc-
tor of athletics at Davidson College,
made public the 1934 football
schedule for the Wildcat eleven,

The team is little different from last
year’s except that Army replaces Wof-
ford. The Wildcats will again play
but nine games, taking an open date
between the Army and Duke games.

The with Elon, who
always puts a scrappy little team on

has

season opens
the field, whose unorthodox style of
football sometimes upsets the big boys.
The game will be played at Davidson.

Last season the Wildcats won over
Elon, 6-0.
On September 29, N. C. State will

be met in a night game at the Me-
morial Stadium Greensboro. The
last time these teams met here was in
1931, when State won, 18-7. The teams
played a 6-6 tie in Raleigh last season.

After this comes the big Army game
at West Point. On the of
the last meeting of these two teams,
the Cadets licked the ’Cats 23-7, but
had a hard time doing it. An open
date follows this game.

The 'Cats then journey to Durham
to meet the powerful Duke eleven,
who licked them 19-7 during the 1933
season,

After the Duke game the Wildcats
return to Richardson Field for the re-

maining five games on the schedule,
which are with The Citadel,, William
and Mary, North Carolina, V. M. 1,
and Wake Forest. During the season
just passed Davidson licked The Cita-
del, 24-6; William and Mary, 12-7;
V. M. IL. 6-0, and Wake Forest, 20-13,
while losing to Carolina, 6-0.
Indications are that Davidson should
do well with this schedule next year.
