Experts and students discuss welfare

Charlotte Congresswoman Sue Myrick and others participate in heated debate

How are local agencies and
recipients handling federal and
state legislation on welfare? Six
speakers with noted experience and
a wide range of political beliefs
attempted to answer this question
to a full house of students, faculty,
and community members Wednes-
day night. Audience and panel
members became heated debating
one of the most controversial top-
ics in America.

In response to their debate, six
student panelists and -approxi-
mately 20 students gathered for a
debate of their own on the same
topic the next night.

The panel on Wednesday in-
cluded Charlotte area Republican
Congresswoman Sue Myrick, Dan
Carrington of the John Locke Foun-
dation, a conservative think tank,
Larry King from the Council for
Children, Caroline Myers from a
crisis assistance organization, Jake
Jacobson from Charlotte, and jobs
program welfare recipient Lisa
Kentsell. From their opening state-
ments, it was obvious to all that the
panel represented a great diversity
of views on the issue.

Myrick began by defending
the Republican Congress’ attempt

to turn authority back to state and
local governments.

Hempsell, a single mother
with a four-year-old daughter,

spoke of her experiences with the
system. She now participates in
the jobs program, which enables
her to attend college and still sup-
port her family. “I don’t want to
depend on the program,” she said,
“but I want to use it to my full
potential.”

Also defending the welfare
system, Myers spoke of the necesity
for a more compassionate system.
She said, “God wants all children
to have the opportunity to thrive —
we need a system of compassion.”
Carrington, in a radically opposite
view, said that all current welfare
programs should be scrapped and
given to the states.

King reported statistics of
abused children, and the money
that they would stop receiving
should the Republicans suceed in
welfare cuts. “We are hitting chil-
dren and holding them account-
able for their parents responsibili-
ties.”

Speaking about local prob-
lems, Jordan said, “If we feally
want welfare reform we would
blow the whole thing up and start
over ... We are saddled with a state
system that we can’t get out of.”

The speakers continued to
debate among themselves and an-
swered questions from the audi-
ence concerning, among other top-
ics, competition among states as a
result of less federal control and
school lunches.

As the panel came to a close,
Myrick said, “I don’t think the

government has a responsibility to
give any of us a living, or to take
care of me or you or anyone else.”

A woman in the audience,
extremely agitated, interrupted
Myrick and screamed, ‘‘You just
don’t get it! ... We as acommunity
don’t have a responsibility to each
other? Is that what you are say-
ing?”

After an exchange in which
Myrick claimed that she was from
a working class family herself, she
responded, “... What we are miss-
ing today is personal responsibil-
ity.”

The diversity of opinions and
intensity of feelings expressed

Wednesday night was matched and
in some ways surpassed at the stu-
dent panel discussion Thursday
night.

The members of the panel
were juniors Mike Bodé, Letitia
Campbell, Latasha Jenkins, and
Liz Pharr and seniors Chad Lloyd
and Danny Newman. _

Newman views the failures
of welfare as an “economic prob-
lem rather than a social problem,”
while Bodé approaches welfare re-
form as a social, “‘not economic,

per se, issue.” The problem is
“people will not be willing to get

off welfare if they do not have
incentive to get a job.” Pharr as-

serted that the government has no
obligation to be involved with
welfare at all. .

Campbell began by saying that
the “function of welfare is the
proper function of the state.”

On the other side, Lloyd cited
numerous statistics to show that
welfare has failed. He endorsed
the welfare reform proposed in the
Republicans’ Contract with
America.

The panel then entertained
questions, theories, and comments

from the audience; this discussion
became quite heated at points.

In all, the discussion lasted
over two hours.

vacation was for, as aremembrance
of what the school and country
were founded on.”

Harmon, Parham, and
Hearon felt the display was inap-
propriate. They wanted to express
their objection and to provoke
thought.

Parham says their work was
not directed against Christianity,
but “was a reaction to the idea that
Christianity is unquestionable
here.” .

Harmon says, “The whole
point of the cross is that we’re not
going to tell you what it means —
if it annoys you, it means some-
thing to you. We didn’t necessar-
ily want to annoy people; rather,
we wanted to make people think.

“My perception of Christian-
ity is that it is a more personal
religion than what they think it is
or what they say it is. When I go
down to Commons and eat dinner
and there’s a band roaring Chris-
tian music, it’s a very forced situ-
ation to me, and I don’t really ap-
preciate that.”

Sapp disagrees that the three
crosses were an attempt to pros-
elytize. He says the display is “no
different from the FLAG display”
(a kiosk put up during AIDS
Awareness week). “There was no
reason for people to feel offended.
Expressing religion is not forcing
religion down people’s throats. It
is unreasonable for people to feel

offended.”

Parham says, “At any other
college they [the three crosses]
would have been ripped down. ...
They were very Davidson specific.
What is the Christian voice here?
What does it do? What does it

represent? We put something up
that has as many levels of interpre-
tation as the other crosses did.”
Bartholomew says the Chris-
tian groups were concerned about
possible alienation of non-Chris-
tians. “The Ecumenical Council

was worried about that. [Anexpla-
nation] was supposed to be in the
paper,” he says.

The groups were counting on
an opinion piece being run in The
Davidsonian explaining the
crosses. The piece was submitted

past the opinions deadline and was
not printed.

Dean of Students Tom
Shandley asked the artists to iden-
tify themselves near the display in
order to assume responsibility for
their action.
