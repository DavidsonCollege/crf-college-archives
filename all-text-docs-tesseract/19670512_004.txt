sibilities are endless.”

Gripes about poor service and
excessive equipment costs in
the newly-renovated Love Audi-
torium have cropped up recent-

' ly.

“One of the largest com-
pliments,”” stated Bob McKel-
lar, who is in charge of light-
ing at concerts and other func-
tions, ‘“‘is that the equipment
should have been fully install-
ed six months ago.”

There have been two main
areas of criticism — lighting
and sound. Workmen are still
working to correct construction
faults in each of these areas.

In discussing problems con-
cerning equipment, McKellar
emphasized that much of the
trouble originated {both with
the contractors and with faulty
equipment such as the dim-
mers.

“Some things have been mis-
wired, some things misnumber-
ed, some lights placed in back-
wards— there was nothing ma-
jor wrong, and yet we have had
many‘small problems,’’ McKel-
lar said.

Most of the defects in the
sound system equipment are
being corrected at the present
at the college's expense.

The weakest part of the sound
system, however, is the speak-
ers. At the present there is one
large speaker overhead. and a
more desirable setup would be
one speaker on each side of the
stage, according to Hicks and
Pitts.

“The auditorium sound equip.
ment just is not adequate for
our concerts,” said Pitts. ‘We
have had to take the Social
Council's sound system from
the Union to Love Auditorium
for every cme this year."

Since the fjfst. of this year.
John OQuzts. assistant alumni
director, has been in charge of
coordinating the work on the
auditorium. McKellar noted that
there have been many improve-
ments since this time.

Before Ouzts was placed in
charge there was no one person
responsible for the work, and
the result was delay in compet-
tion the project.

McKellar also said that Gro-

sical plant. has spent much

Although McKellar, Hicks,
and Pitts had much to say
about problems that they have

encountered with the audi-
torium equipment, they all
agreed on the great potential of
the facilities in Love Audito-
rium.

“When the present defects

and speaker problems have

“our sound system should be as
good as any professional sys-
tem that I have seen, including

Council Requests Interim
In Readmission Payments

By JOHN WILLIAMS
Staff Writer

The Student Council recom-
mended at its Monday meeting
that students who are consid.
ering transferring to another
school for the coming year be
allowed an interim period from
March 15 to April 10 in which
to pay their $100 fee for read.
‘mission to Davidson the next
year.

The council also voted to.
make a recommendation to the
business office that a machine
be purchased to make new,
more durable student identifi-
cation cards.

The first motion, which was
prompted by a request from
Admissions Director H. Ed-
munds White. would save those
Students who are wailing to
hear from other colleges after
March 13 the $106 fee that they
would pay and forfeit under the
present system.

These students would, howev-
er. have to pay a $10 late fee.

It would also give those stu-
dents who simply forget to pay
their fees the chance to pay $110
and not have to remain on the
waiting list in order to be read-
mitted.

The motion recommending the
new machine was voted down
at first because students would
have to finance the machine by
paying a dollar to get their ID

card. Some members felt that
the college could afford to buy
the “machine and should con-
tinue to pay for the student ID
cards.

Council members later passed
the motion when President Tom
Earnhardt pointed out that the
new card could provide such ex.
tra advantages as speeding. up

the process of checking out li.

ry books.

By using machines which
would print students’ names on
a library card. such a process
could be put into effect.

The new cards would have a!

color picture of the student with
different possible color back
grounds. a tight plastic seal
making it more durable and

better looking and all the nec |

essary statistics about the stu
dent. The cards could be made
very quickly on campus.
Earnhardt pointed out that
there are now 500 books missing
from the library that have not
been checked out. Dr, Chalmers
Davidson, director of the libra
ry. has declared a period of
grace ending May 17 during
which students can return these
books without paying a fine.

About SSOC’s failure to re-
ceive a charter as a campus or
ganization, Student Body Presi-
dent Tom Earnhardt said in a
prepared statement. ‘Because
no recommendation to charter
the SSOC was given by the Stu-
dent Activities Committee at its
meeting May 10 does not mean
that a charter will not be given.
Committee members wanted a
list of local projects along with
the SSOC national constitution.
I don’t foresee any problems at
the next meeting.”

Any group seeking a charter
as a campus organization has to
submit a constitution to the Stu-
dent Activities Committee. The

greater pleasure working for you, the undergrads of
America? You’ve been a most satisfactory audience, and
I'm going to miss you this summer. In fact, I’d ask you
all to come visit me except there is no access to my room.
The makers of Personna, after I missed several deadlines,

gleaming and constant —as good and true and gleaming
and constant as the blades they make—and I wish to state
publicly that I will always hold them in the highest esteem,
no matter how my suit for back wages comes out.

And so, to close the year, I give you one Jast mnemonic:
