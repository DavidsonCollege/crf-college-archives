Winter Workshop Theater begins new season

By LUCIA KENDALL

girlfriend, Ann, played by senior

’ Catherine Norton.

The one act plays “Present
Tense” and “Mr. Flannery’s
Ocean” were presented “in-the-
round” in the back of Hodson Hall
Jan. 29 and 30.

“Present Tense,” directed by
junior Lee Eichelberger, is a teen-
age comedy. It deals with the ado-
lescent insecurities of Norm,
played by freshman Gates
Grainger, about his pretty, but
somewhat bubble-headed

His worries are compounded
by senior Randy Ingram in the role
of the-conceited jock, Doug, who
is Ann’s former boyfriend.
Sophomore Lowell Keller, as
Jerry, Norm’s best friend, plays
on his fears and further compli-
cates his situation by setting him
up on a double date with two
junior college girls, played by
sophomore Marisa Gaba and
freshman Molly Bass. Of course,

right before the prom, the story is
resolved with Norm’s realization
that Ann does love him after all.

“Mr Flannery’s Ocean” is a
charming drama directed by
senior Allison Rose. It centers
around Jim Flannery, an old
crotchety Irishman played by
senior Wayne Magruder, who in-
sists that he owns the ocean, and
gives permission to children
(freshman Leigh Hall and sopho-
more Reese Boyd) who want to
play in it.

Sophomore Donna Peters, in
the role of the exasperated maid
Maug, adds comic relief. Mrs.
Klapington, played by sophomore
Martha Johnston, runs the small
beach resort that has attracted
young newlyweds Mr. and Mrs.
Morrison, acted by sophomores
Jim Dillon and Julie Zimmerman,
for their honeymoon.

The appearance of senior Noel
Brewster as Mrs. Pringle, a dying
old woman, changes Mr. Flan-
nery’s attitude about life to the

point where he gives her his most

beloved possession and favorite -
companion, his ocean, The actors
and actresses carried off their for-
eign accents with surprising suc-
cess. Magruder and Brewster also
achieved a very convincing look
of age.

Two more one-act plays —
“The Dutchman” and “Wild
Roses” — will be given tomor-
row and Friday nights starting at 7
p.m.
