VPI takes first in Relays;
Davidson places 18th of 40

By ROB GILLISON
Assistant Sports Editor

Virginia Tech, in their first
appearance ever in the David-
son Relays, won. seven of 21
events to take first place with a
total of 110 points. Appalachian
took second with 93 points and
Duke, Cumberland and Frost-
burg all tied for third; each had
48 points.

Davidson finished eighteenth
out of the nearly 40 teams but
could manage only 6 points.
Willie Lanier and Lance Sisco
placed highest among David-
son’s male athletes. Lanier took
fourth in the shot put, and Sisco
placed sixth in the 110 meter
high hurdles...

Track team captain Karl
McPhail felt that Davidson
might have been able to perform
better in the sprints and relays

had the football players who

make up the majority of the

runners in these events been ©

excused from spring football
practice to practicé their events.

Football coach Ed Farrell
responded, ‘Davidson College
has placed its priority on foot-
ball over track. If the football
team is to have a chance at a
national championship then
spring practice is essential.’’
Farrell also added, ‘‘I feel I’m
already bending over back-
wards allowing Lance Sisco,
who takes his participation in
track more seriously, to miss

i Pridav practicas “grvhecan mest,

or practice his hurdles. I’ve also
been careful not to schedule any
Saturday practices so there will
be no conflict with the track
meets.”

Track coach Karl Kremser
was pleased with the perfor-
mance of his team. Most ath-
letes turned in their best times
or distances.

Among the fourteen girls’
teams that participated in’ the
Davidson Relays, Frostberg do-
minated the meet by winning
nine of 12 events, and racking
up a total of 142 points. West
Virginia was a distant second
with 75 points.

The Davidson women man-
aged 28 points for a fourth place
tie. Elizabeth Dean, and Sarah
Todd were able to do what no
other Davidson athletes could
achieve; they placed in the top
three of an event. Dean won the
3000 meter race, and Todd came
in second in the same event.
same event. .

ball Wildcats will end spring
