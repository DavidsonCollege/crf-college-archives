WOODROW WILSON ON THE
BIBLE.

This is What President Wilson
Wrote for the Testaments for
The Soldiers and Sailors
During the War.

“The Bible is the word of life.
I beg that you will read it and find
this out for yourselves—read, not
little snatches here and there, but
long passages that will really be
the road to the heart of it. You
will find it full of real men and
women not only, but also of the
things you have wondered about
and been troubled about all your
life, as men have been always; and
the more you read the more it will
become plain to you what things
are worth while and what are not,
what things make men happy—
loyalty, right dealing, speaking the
truth, readiness to give everything
for what they think their duty, and
most of all, the wish that they may

have the real approval of the
Christ, who gave everything for
them—and the things that are

guaranteed to make men unhappy
selfishness, cowardice, greed and
everything that is low and mean.
When you have read the Bible you
will know that it is the Word of
God, bécause you will have found
it the key to your heart, your own
happiness and your own duty.”

PROGRAM NEXT SUNDAY

A special Christmas program will be
put on at the “Y” service Sunday night.
Appropriate Christmas music by the or-
chestra and the quartette will be one of
the features. E. E. Houghton will give
the story of “The Other Wise Man.”

An effort will be made to hold this

meeting in the church so that the town;

people may attend. If this effort is suc-
cessful, Doctor Richards will probably
give a short _talk_on—the—

SPECIAL SERVICE HELD AT
CALDWELL SUNDAY SCHOOL

Special services were conducted at the
Caldwell Sunday School on last Sunday
afternoon, Doctor Arbuckle being the
speaker. The local “Y” quartette was
present, and sang a special selection in
addition to helping materially with the
music’as a whole. Mr. Robert E. Mell,
who spoke at the college vesper service
later in the evening, led the singing and
gave a solo just after Doctor Arbuckle’s
address.

In spite of the fact that services are
being held regularly at Huntersville now,
the attendance at Caldwell continues
good, and the teachers feel very much
encouraged over the work there. This
is the first Service of this kind that has
been held at Caldwell this fall, but plans
