THE DAVIDSONIAN, NOVEMBER 23, 1932

All-Americans Trample
__Wingate Junior College

Displaying good offensive power, Coach
Unger’s “All-American” football team, com-
posed of members of the Varsity B squad,
defeated Wingate Junior College, 33 to 0, in
a one-sided game played on Richardson
Field on Saturday, November 19.

From the kickoff to the last play there
was little doubt as to the outcome of the
game and the Davidson team showed—its
great strength by piling up the score of 33
points, whereas. Wingate Juniors were un-
able to score.

Although handicapped. by a wet field,
Bumgarner and Dickerson led the “All-
Americans” in a running attack which car-
“ried the pigskin from one end of the field
to the other. Doc Unger’s team also gave
a good exhibition of defensive strength, and
as the score indicates, the Wingate eleven
gained very little ground from scrimmage.

The “All-Americans” used several differ-
ent types of plays in the contest, among
which were those of Wake Forest, David-
son, and Carolina.

. Wingfield and Hand, who haven't seen

regular duty for the last two or three games
on account of injuries, are expected to be
in practically normal condition for the game.
Captain Gardner will be stronger, but re-
ceived a slight lip injury in the last game;
however, he will probably see much action
on Thanksgiving Day. The whole team will,
in fact, be more powerful and primed against
the Deacons, although they face some stiff
workouts.

Wake Forest has a powerful and heavy
team this year, with a good backfield, and
a strong line that has no weak spots. Both
teams are about equal in weight.

The holiday game is expected to draw one
of the biggest crowds of the year and prom-
ises to be one of the most thrilling. David-
son is determined more than ever to over-
come the jinx which has hung over the Wild-
cats for the past eleven years, and has the
advantage this year of playing on her own
field.

The following is a list of the resulting
scores of the past years:

tians cannot be missionaries in the strictest
sense; but we can all bear witness to Christ
at every possible opportunity.

For the third fact, the doctor said that
we must have a number of visions of help-
ing and inspiring others to Christ. Unless
we have these visions, and carry them out,
we are not true witnesses for Christ.

As the fourth and last point, we must have
the illuminating spirit of God. The speaker
closed his talk by bringing attention again
to the thought and the words of the text:
that we are all witnesses of Christ, and we
should at all times by our faith give testi-
mony for Him, :

After the singing of the last hymn, Dr.
W. L. Lingle dismissed the service with a
prayer.

cussed the physiology of breathing, and de-

WE buy the finest, the

does not explain why folks
everywhere regard Lucky
Strike as the mildest ciga-

overlook the truth that
“Nature in the Raw is

fine tobaccos, after proper

cigarettes.
