The Davidsonian

Phase Five Investors Diversify Risks

Some call it legalized gambling.
Some liken it to roulette. One can play
in either of two ways. Speculate or
buy the blue chips.

Four Davidson sophomores, Martin
Eakes, Andy Lamas, Larry Mimms.
and Ed Sibley formed a partnership
and began the life of gamblers by
buying stocks on the New York Stock
Exchange in January.

The partnership is aptly called
Phase 5 Investors because, according
to Mimms, they had 5 members
originally and they assumed a Nixon
Phase 5 was in the offing.

Eakes explained that investment is
like poker “The same risk that
makes bridge and poker so addictive
is what makes investment so in-
teresting. You alwavs take the game
more serious!, when you have money
behind your chips. I figure our part-
nership is a good chance to learn
while the stakes are still low.”

Phase 5 Investors have invested
$3200 out of their total contributed
capital of $5500.

“We are not losing any sleep over
our stocks and we don't have any
executive ulcers vet... Mimms quip-
ped.

**Noone has invested more than he
can afford to lose, but you better
believe that we'd hate to see any of
our money gobbled up by the Dow
Jones Machine,” he said.

“We are growing. but everything
we do is still in a rather miniaturistic
scale. Unfortunately, we have lost
everything in the last week that we
made in the first month,”’ Eakes said.

The biggest problem that faced
these four investors was the initial
organization and legalization. Sibley
stated that after studying various
alternative forms of organization,

they decided that a general part-
nership would be best suited to their
goals.

‘In forming the partnership we
didn't have to comply with legal red
tape and lawyer's fees. We opened an
account with the Bache Brokerage
firm, filed for an employer iden-
tification number, established a
checking account, and wrote part-
nership articles.

“Our next series of problems in-
volved setting up the books and
devising a research stock evaluation
method.”

According to Sibley, Phase 5 In-
vestors do their own research and
play their own hunches. They rank a
company within its industry,
weighing the factors such as stock
price and dividend. along with com-
pany performance in the past five
years

“We made our first investment
decision at about 2 a.m. one Tuesday
morning.’ Lamas stated. ‘‘We
decided then to buy Diversified Mt. at
14. The actual price of the stock was
15, and our stock broker told us that
there was no way that we would be
able to buy at 14.

Later in the day he called back
saying that the price was 1434. We
didn’t budge. Even later he called
saying the price was 14's, and that
price was as low as the stock could go.
Anyway, to make a long story short,
the following day the stock price drop-
ped sharply to 13'2 bypassing 14, and
we bought at 1312."

Since that time, Phase 5 has pur-
chased stock in two other companies,
but the stocks ave performed poorly
in the past week.

Sibley claimed confidently that they
will make money in the long term,

even though present economic con-
ditions are uncertain.

‘Since there are only four of us, we
can meet regularly, but at the same
time find convenient times for
everyone. At our partnership
meetings, we discuss our investments
and make buy/sell decisions.’’ Lamas
stated.

Lamas proudly displays a filing
cabinet which holds their annual
reports. research reports and
brokeage information. ‘‘We hope to
have eventually an annual report
from every company on the New York
Stock Exchange,” he stated. .

‘Presently we are investigating
such investment alternatives as
buying on margin, writing and buying
puts and calls, and buying into the
Chicago Board of Exchange.”

“The partnership is an experiment
in working with other people as
equals,’’ Eakes said. ‘‘Part of my in-
terest in the company is in seeing how

we work out (or fail to work out) our
problems and conflicts as a group.”
Sibley entered the venture because of
what he termed “‘a long and moneyed
interest in the stock market'’, while
Lamas wanted an opportunity to
establish some contacts in the
business world.

“I went into the group, like my part-
ners, primarily to learn about the
working of the Stock Market,’
Mimms said.

According to Lamas, they have
learned that the price of a stock on
any given day is not determined by
how well that company performs, but
by political decisions and events of
that day, and by the attractiveness or
‘name appeal "' of the company.

“Our philosophy has been like a
poster I've seen. ‘Behold the turtle
who moves forward only when he
sticks his neck out! Unfortunately
that’s when he’s most vulnerable’,”
Mimms said.
