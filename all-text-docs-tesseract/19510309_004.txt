It was plumb un-
Davidson like. Here it
was the second day of
baseball practice, and it
hadn’t rained yet.
What's more, the gent-
leman wore a_ black
baseball cap with the
red D afront—the un-

DO athletie staff, yet
claimed he didn’t even
have the word ‘‘lose’’ in
his vocabulary.

This is not to brand
the remainder of our

- coaching staff de-
By BILL WHITE featists. But most of
them will admit they list ‘‘lose” among the words they’ve had
to use now and then at some time in the past. As a matter of
fact, isn’t a good baseball coach supposed to quip as regularly as
the spring’s first robin, ‘Wal, we'll win some; lose some; and
we'll have some rained out."’

Frank Packard hasn’t as yet had any rained out, and he
is not planning to lose any. This is the man who has been given
the job of giving Davidson a baseball team this spring, a job
which he seems on sight every bit capable of handling. His
frank, friendly face looks like that of a major league skipper,
and he walks and talks like a baseball coach. That’s the surface
dope, and it all speaks well. But his zest for the game and for
winning is svhat shotld make the DC nine a little meaner on
the foe this year. ;

“‘T’m reaily glad to get back in the game,” the Charlotte
postal employee led off with. ‘“My last time out was ‘at High
Point back in '39. The club was a member of the old Carolina
league. I was player, manager, and owner. Had to hustle in
those days!

“It is, of course, too early for me to know anything about
this team. Haven't been with the fellows but vesterday and
today and can’t tell what’s what quite vet. I’m really waiting
for some real,warm weather to let these pitchers begin to bear
down so I can see what. they’ve got. Yes, I hear a veteran in-
field cleared out last vear at graduation. Might have a job of
rebuilding to do there. .

“The main thing I’d like to shake out of this team is any
defeatist attitude they may have before the season starts. Boy,
1 don’t like that word lose. That's an ugly word to me.. Don’t
even keep it in my vocabulary. I’ve always played with a win-
ner, and I’m not wanting to change over nowy. We're going to
hustle this spring. Anybody who doesn’t hustle just, well they
just won’t be playing ball. And these fellows do seem to want
to play ball.”

The corfident, determined, assertive way in which Packard
spoke is another reason for betting he can do the job. The man-
ner reminded us of the same, sure way Crowell little spoke last
spring about his fall club, and who would deny the improved
spirit and performance of the Cats on the gridiron this fall. Not
world beaters, no, but that listlessness was almost completely
gone. That is what must go in baseball. In light of the opposition
to be faced, Packard probably has better material to build with
than did Coach Crowell, though it’s close. But Packard doesn’t
have the time. He launched practice on the fifth and the first
game is here March 19, one week from /Monday with Springfield.

‘““We have two with Springfield and one >with Boston in
three days,” Packard explained. ‘‘They have been to Florida

‘on an extended tour, and they'll really be hot on their way
home. And here we'll be just opening the season.” Nevertheless,
with good weather Packard thinks he can whip the club into
decent opening shape within the week and a half period. After
the Boston game on the 21st, he has until April 2 to get the Cats
ready for their first Southern Conférence test with Duke here.

Packard plans to move his forces onto the new diamond per-
manently as soon as possible, and he is not as concerned with
the size of the outfield as have been thirdbase box seaters in
the student body. ‘‘No sir, nothing wrong with that outfield!
With a good board fence running around there, anybody who
puts one over it is going to earn himself his extra bases!’’

And Mr. Packard knows plenty about extra bases. In 1931,
playing in the Piedmont League, he led in seven hitting de-
partments—.366 batting average, 145 runs scored, 185 hits, 17
doubles, 21 home runs, 123 RBI, and 21 sacrifice knocks. He
also led his league in 1927 while at Greensburg, Pa., with a .385
stick mark, which in turn led Frank to the Pittsburg Pirates.
He also saw action with Buffalo, Baltimore, Portland, Albany,
Cumberland, Columbia, and later Gastonia, High Point, and
Mount Airy. During the last war Packard was a Chief Specialist
in the Navy athletic program? stationed at Duke for nearly
three years. °

Wildcat Clubbers
Red and Black Game

Be spring though it may, football
very much still holds a place of
prominence in Wildcat sports, and
next weekend a Wildcat Club meet-
ing will witness an intra-squad full
dress scrimmage with all the trint-
mings of. mid-fall,

The occassion is the annual Red
and Black Game, slated for Satur-
day next at 2:30 on Richardson
Field. As usual, the game will cli-
max the winter drills, but Coach
Crowell Little expects to continue
working some while after the scrim-
mage, even if Gn an anti-clamactical
scale.

The Wildcat clubbers will be on
hand to get a look at what they
may expect on the grid from the
Wildcats next season. They will
not, however, get a complete look,
in that freshmen ‘will be allowed to
compete in the Southern Confer-
ence this autumn, and J.ittle plans
to use them unsparingly. It is a
matter of necessity.

Had the expected returnees from
the 1950 club all remained in
school, the Cats would have field-
ed an improved club. But the
armed forces have already taken
four key men—one a veteran— and
threaten to deplete the ranks even
more this summer.

Guard Jim‘ Fasul and fullback
C. L. Runyan, both counted on: for
starting duty, left. during Christ-
mas, with Bill Acker and ex-Marine
Bill Stanley following suit several
weeks ago. Little had been bank.
ing on Stanley, non-draftable and
now eligible after two years of
wrangling with the books, to fill
very capably Runyan’s vacated full-
back slot. Ham Wade now remains
the top plunger with ex-end Bob
Turk converted to reserve full-
back: Wade and Turk are ROTC
protected.

The Red and Black game, tien,
should feature a few surprises in
the way of new or converted talent.
Turk may surprise a folk or two
at fullback also. He was elected the
outstanding back in the city of At-
lanta his senior year in high school.

Hengeveld Performs
For Stars Tomorrow
Against N. C. State

Fred (Dutch) Hengeveld, Wild-
cat basketball co-captain, joins a
team of Southern Conference ail-
stars which meets N.C. State’s
Southern Conference champions in
Raleigh tonight.

Hengeveld, who along with Tom-
my Haller, led the Cat band of
‘juniors and sophomores on the
court this year, was a set. shot sen-
sation throughout the season. As a
guard he frequently played with
little relief and turned in a sterling
performance in his every otting.
The senior from Davidson twisted
his knee against McCrary’s Fagles,
a knee that has troubled him in
basketball and baseball in the past.
He has, however, been able to
shake the injury successfully again,
has been working out for baseball
for a week, and is ready for hard-
wood action once more.

Aside from the honor of selec-
tion to such an all-star aggregation,
Dutch will receive a handsome gold
watch as a gift from N. C. State,
sponsors of the now annual post-
season classic.

This is the second year of the
affair. Whit Cobb, last year’s cap-
tain and outstanding guard, repre
sented Davidson at the inital con-
test which N. C. State won last
winter.

Another survey, this one at Idaho
State College, showed that almost
half of the coeds there sleep with
teddy bears, pandas, or other stuffed
toy animals.

Gene Craven will be showing before his old teadher here this
week-end when he wrestles for Davidson in the 128-pound division
of the Carolinas AAU wrestling meet, A native of Boone, Gene
learned most of his pre-college wrestling from Appalachian’s Coach
Red Watkins by hanging around the App workout room. Unde.
feated last year as a freshman, Gene this week won the consolation
title in the 121-pound division of the Southern Conference meet.

Craven Wins Consolation Crown
For Lone Cat Honors at Mat Meet

Gene Craven, Davidson’s mat wise little sophomore, claimed
the only honors Davidson garnered in the Southern Conference
wrestling tournament at Washington and Lee Tuesday and Wed-

nesday of this week.

Craven won the 123 pound consolation finals, defeating

Reggie Buie of N. C. State, 2.0, for
the honor, equivalent to a third
place finish in competition. Cra-
ven had previously eliminated the
Citadel's Ed Laney, 7-1 in the con-
solation preliminary round.

George (Bucky) Irvin, a soph who
has been grappling everywhere but
in his proper 137 pound weight’
this winter, came through the con.
solation preliminariés with a 5-2 de-
cision, over Tom Murphy of West
Virginia, but lost in the consolation
finals to Nobbs of N. C. State.

Other Davidson results were all
in the preliminary consolation
rounds: 147 pounds—Ed Brown,
(VMI) pinned Morley Vail, 3:13;
167 pounds—Pill Venable (VMI)
pinned Jerry Morrow, 4:52; Un-
limited, Jerry Jack (W&L) decis-
joned Lill McNeely, 7-4.

Venable, knocked
during the first round of his match

unconscious I

with Morrow, came back strong in
a remarkable recovery to pin the
Cat matter.. ;
_VMI__ outscored _ neighboring
Washington and Lee, 29-23 to take
the title away from the Generals.
Davidson finished in a tie for sev-
enth in the ten-team meet.

A Nebraska coed complained to
a bookstore owner that it was un-
fair. to make students buy books
at such a high price, and then get
hardly anything back for them on
the used book. market.

“But,” explained the bookstore
owner calmly, “you couldn't buy
a dress at a shop downtown and
then take it back and get the same
price for it, could you?”

“Well,” she retorted, “at least
‘d get some use out of the dress.”

Pi Kapps Win 1950 Handball Play
With KS, ATO Knotting for Second

By JACK EFIRD

The Pi Kapps won the 1951 hand
ball tournament by compiling a
record of nine victories in ten
games, The race was tight all the
way with the two second place
finishers, the ATO's and the Kappa
Sigs, close on the heels of the win.
ners with identical records of eight
victories and two defeats.

Except for the ATO defeat by
the Phi Gams and the Kappa Sig
defeat by the Betas, all the defeats
of the top three teams were admin-
istered by each other.

The PiKapps defeated the ATO’s
the ATO's defeated the Kappa Sigs,
and the Kappa Sigs defeated the
PiKapps.

Until the last two rounds of the

tournament the Kappa Sigs had an
undefeated record. However, the
Betas beat them in the next to last
rqund to knock them out of a first
place tie.

At the end of the season, the
PiKapps had compiled a record of
seven straight victories to pull the
championship away from the Kappa

Appalachian Still Rates Favorite
To Retain Carolinas Championship

By DICK LILES

Applichian State Teachers

College brings § wrestlers and

the A. A. U. crown to Davidson this weekend for the A. A. U.
Carolinas Wrestling Championships. Coach Red Watkins’ ter-
rible grapplers hatve won national honors and intend to add

his one to their long string.

Up until time for press a total
of 76 wrestlers had entered their
names entitling them to compete
in the matches. Eight teams have
entered including Coach Charlie
Parker’s Varsity and Freshman
squads, North Carolina, Camp Le-
jeune Marines, Cherry Point Mar-
ines, Appalachian, Albemarle Y,
Western Carolina, and High Point
Y. Also two men are coming down
from Chapel Hill, formerly wrest-
lers at Carolina. They are Oscar
Gupton and Phil Kemp.

Camp Lejeune has a little man
that should show up well in the
meet. He is Cpl. Bill Norris, 212
pound heavyweight A.A.U. champ-
ion from Pennsylvania. Norris has
a long string of honors to his rec-
ord and has been outstanding on
his Marine team for several years.
Camp Lejeune has another man to
watch in the 147 pound class. He
is Pfc. Hal Hampson, who has
been successful in several cam-
paigns in the last few years.
Coach Scott says that the weigh-
ing-in process will take up most of
Friday morning and that the real

action starts in the afternoon. The
matches will continue with the semi-
finals and quarter-finals Saturday
morning and the finals that after-
noon: Individual medals will be
given to the first four men in each
class and team trophies to the win-
ner and runner-up teams after the
last match Saturday afternoon.

General opinion is that Appala-
chian will again take the meet,
but the service teams cannot be
overlooked. They're plenty tou
and most of them have had plenty
of experience before their Marine
days. Many of the wrestlers have
previous records on the A. A. U.
books and many more have pro-
duced some real fine high school
records,

Since this is not a regularly sche.
iuled event as far as David
lege is concerned, a slight admis-
sion will be charged of Davidson
students for this meet. Fifty cents
will let you see all the matches,
while each would cost 25c. This
is-due, of course, to the expense in-
volved in the putting on of such a
meet.
