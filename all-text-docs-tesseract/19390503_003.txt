“What suggestions do you have con-

week's covers

cerning the naming of the new
dormitery?” The following are
what the BMOC's had/ to say in
answer to the above:
John Reisner, Senior:

Few people’ attach enough im-

portance to this question of naming
a building. I cite the examples of
East and West Dormitories. Those

with the of the
barns, hardly reflect any more orig-

made it great.

Cameron Clark, Senior:

So I would name it “Harding

ing, or I Would name it “Duke
Dormitory” in honor of James B.
Duke and as a salutation from Da-
vidson’s centennial celebration to
Duke University’s centennial cele-
bration.

Bill Rainey, Senior:
Ifthe name of a dormitory or

any other building, we have some-
thing to be constantly used and re-
membered for years to come. I be-
lieve that it would be only proper
for us to honor outstanding
alumnus of Davidson by naming our
new dormitory after him. Not only
would it show our respect and ad-
miration to a great man, but also
it would be advantageous to the
school itself. Graduates of Davidson
are outstanding in many fields of
today, but probably our most fam-
ous alumnus is the late President
Wilson. I would like to see our new
building dedicated Woodrow
Wilson to show our
of a truly great man.

some

to
appreciation

Graham McFadyen, Junior:

Lately there has been some talk
that the faculty and student body
aren't getting along together very
well, but in naming the new dorm
there shouldn’t be any kick coming
if the faculty were to suggest sev-
eral names and allow the student
body to vote for one of them. The
faculty sure to pick one that
will suit the students, and then
everyone ought to be satisfied. As
this will be the first building pro-
ject since the Centennial, I'm in
favor of naming it: ‘Centennial
Hall.”

Buck Powell, Junior:

Since this year marks
bration of the hundredth
sary of the founding of Davidson
College, ‘and as a tribute to our
Dean, I suggest that the new dormi-
tory be called “Sen-Tennial Hall.”
Stuart Oglesby, Junior:

The building of a new dormitory
fulfills a great need at Davidson.
In view of the fact, it seems fitting
to name such an addition to David-
son after some outstanding man
who has in the past or present con-
tributed the success of this
school. This would include men who
have served outstandingly as pro-
fessots, and also those who have
contributed generously to our en-
dowment. I am not familiar enough
with the men who have given fin-
ancial aid to the college to suggest
any name along that line, but as
for professors I would suggest Dr.
Martin, Dr. Arbuckle, Dr. Sentelle,
or Dr. Harding.

Don Bell, Freshman:

Our new dormitory is to be an
ultra-modern construction which is
to be equipped to the nth degree.
The students who will inhabit our
new building will be given the
