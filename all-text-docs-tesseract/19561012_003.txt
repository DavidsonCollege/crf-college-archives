By JOHN JOHNSON —

Davidson's victory last Saturday in downing Presbyterian
College 26-6 was a remarkable comeback for the Red and
Black squad. To suffer the trouncing of 34-7 delt by Citadel
and then retaliate seven days later to defeat an arch rival by
the greatest margin since 1919 is a feat worthy of considera-
ble attention.

The difference in the team spirit in the two contests
was the difference in black and white. In a period of
one week the boys were transformed from a quiet, well
trained football team to an aggressive and spirited fight-
ing unit.

Who should take credit for such a change? Undoubtedly
the coaches can take a bow; the student support and wild
send-off helped; but the greatest tribute must go to the
players themselves. Each man showed the determination,
hustle, and ardent will-to-win that is necessary for victorious
clubs.

ONLY A FEW

As Coach Ratterree said after reviewing the films of the
action, ‘To pick out a single player for tribute would be a
mistake for this was a team victory. Every man contributed.”

Yet to point out none because all are worthy of mention
would be a mistake, too. So, though only a few are cited it is
with the realization that many more could be named.

The engineer of a game must re-
ceive credit. Quarterback Dyke Little’s
mixing of runs and passes kept the
Hose in a constant state of indecision.
He varied the use of his backfield
personnel! constantly and ran enough
himself to bring his season average
to seven yards a carry, the team’s best

average.
IN THE LINE TOO

Dave Fagg not only booted two extra points but also set
up the second Cat touchdown by intercepting a PC pitch-out
in mid air. His jarring tackle of a Blue Hose runner behind
the line of scrimmage resulted in a Davidson recovered
fumble.

In the final quarter, tackle Lanny Voight broke through
the defenses.to block PC's attempted extra point. However,
the glory of the line’s game was not so much in how they
contributed directly to. the score but rather the vicious way
they blocked and tackled. Dale Gramley turned in one of his
best performances.

RUN, RUN, RUN

Paul Barbee caught the crowds eye dramatically when
he hauled in Little’s 30-yard pass and scampered 21 yards to
pay dirt. He was also a consistent ground gainer in the short
runs department.

Donny McRee maintained his position as Davidson’s
leading ground gainer and punter. The 165 pound left half-
back upped his total yards gained to 176.

Big, red-headed fullback Ken Conger proved to ‘have
the power when needed as he bulled through the line for
two touchdowns. His crushing kickoff tackle was one of the
best remembered defensive plays of the game.

A MISTAKE?

In preparation for games to be played in Davidson, the
college is undertaking needed construction on the press
booth and other stadium facilities. Consideration was given
to the idea of removing the unsightly loudspeakers presently
situated in front of the stands.

Apparently the latter plan has been discarded in favor
of merely replacing the wooden pole by a metal one. It seems
that the college would err in not placing the view-blocking
speakers in an inconspicious place at the top or side of the
stadium while they have the men and equipment to make
the change.

Davidson's cross country team opened their 1956 season
by placing second in their triangular meet with Washington |

last Saturday.

men’ runners were defeated — by

Angus McBryde, in his first
collegiate cross-country race,
finished fifth and best of the
Davidson men, being beaten by
four VMl-runners. On the fast
W&L-course McBryde, as well
as Pete Ashcraft who finished
sixth, recorded excellent
times, both under 22 minutes.

The winner was Dave Pitkethly,
Southern Conference champ here
at Davidson last year. Henry Brown
followed behind McBryde and Ash-
craft, getting 7th place. Frosh Jim
Alexander satisfied all expecta-
tions with a 10th place.

Of the eight Davidson harriers
who made the trip only two were
seniors; the team contains four
sophomores and two freshmen, and |
should develop into one of the}
finest squads in Davidson's cross-
country history.
