Money Bestows Life
In Placement Plans

By MARK WILENSKY
Asst. Managing Editor

(This is the second article in a

series of two focusing on the
placement problem at David-
son.)

A year ago Extended Studies
Career Director Randall R.
Kincaid Jr., and Psycology
Professor John Kelton sub-
mitted a grant proposal to the
government, hoping to get
enough money to consolidate a
program of placement, off cam-
pus study, co-op education,
summer placement and
vocational counseling. A grant
of $25,000 was received. The
question now is how to spend it.

Kincaid has been placed in
charge of suggesting to the
college how to expand its
facilities to better advise
students of the alternatives they
have after graduation.

Kincaid’s recommendations
(a rough plan has beenendorsed
by the Senate) would insure the
formation of a new office.
operating as part of the Student
Counseling Office under Direc-
tor of Counseling William B.
Hight.

This office would bring
together the testing and coun-
seling now done by Hight, the
Career Service Program, the
Placement services of the
college, a summer internship
placement service, a coop-
erative education service,
and would also be available to
perform various services for

the pre-professional com-
mittees.
If ‘fragmentation’ is the

major ill in the way that these
services are now provided, Kin-
caid’s plan should cure it nicely.

‘‘What we will be doing is
providing a central place for
students to go to when they
begin to plan for the future,’’ he
said.

According to Hight, this plan-
ning cannot begin too soon.
‘‘Revelation doesn’t often come
in a blinded flash.’’ he

id. ‘‘The time to begin to plan

for the future is now, not next
week or next year.”’

Kincaid envisions’ the
workings of the new office as
being similar to a clearing-
house.

The new program will be
based on practical experiences.
Internships will be sought, co-
Op programs started, anc
meaningful contacts with those
people now in the business anc
professional world will be
stressed.

‘‘Many people come to me
feeling sure they want to be doc-
tors or lawyers, but have never
experienced exactly what these
people do,”’ Hight said. ‘‘Kin
caid’s program of internships
and experiences’ should
alleviate this problem.”

While stressing the internship
type of experience, the program
will include much more.

“We're going to hire a staff
member whose sole duty will be
to coordinate this office,"’ Kin-
caid said.

‘To keep the record straight,
I do not wish to be considered
for the job,”’ he added.

Kincaid said that the college
has begun to move toward fin-
ding a director for the program
and that he hopes the program
will be operating by March.

“We hope to be able to aid
students in two ways,” he said.
‘*We want to provide the student
with information about himself
and about where people like
him can do their thing.”’

Kincaid’s program will try to
point out the alternatives to
graduate school that many
students are now unaware of.

“If students know that there
is one place that they can come
to when they are planning for
the future, more should make
use of the facility,’’ Kincaid
concluded.

Hight put it another way.
“The time when a Davidson

grad could choose what he wan-
ted to do and be assured of
doing it is over. Our students
need to plan for their futures.’

SGA Advisory Council Strives
For Student-Faculty Exchange

By CHARLIE SHEPHERD
Managing Editor

Should I sign up for this cour-
se? How does a center professor
teach his class? As a freshman,
would this course be too dif-
ficult for me right now?

These are questions that con-
tinually plague Davidson
students, and nothing so far
seems to have solved the
problem.

However, Student Govern-
ment President Bo Phillips has
initiated a program which may
help in this area. He is in the
process of establishing a
Student Advisory Council which
will serve as a bridge between
faculty and students.

Phillips gave two primary
reasons why the Advisory Com-
mittee is needed at Davidson.
First, he believes that although
the course evaluation booklet is
valuable, it does not adequately

assist students when used
alone.
Phillips likened the booklet to

a still photograph taken of a
process that is constantly

changing. He explained that
many professors change their
pedagogical methods from
term to term, and although the
booklet it updated every two
years or so, it cannot keep up
with these changes.

Secondly, Phillips believes
that students are not willing to
speak candidly about classes
with their professors. ‘‘It’s a
matter of people being afraid
to be honest with professors,”
commented Phillips. He ad-
mitted that some com-
munication goes on informally
now, but that this is small in
comparison to the rapport
which should be evident.

The Advisory Council will
consist of two students from
each departmental major who
can work easily with the
professors in that department,
especially the department
chairmen. The students will air
grievances from other students
to the faculty and suggest ways
to improve various problems
that arise.

They will comment on what is
being taught and will criticize
teaching methods which - from
the students’ viewpoints, need
improvement. Phillips stressed

the advisory role of the Coun-
cil; faculty members will in no
way be bound by the
suggestions.

Certain departments will not
be included in the program
because of the small numbers of
majors in them. Physics, the
foreign languages, and
philosophy are among the ones
which will not participate.

On the other hand, depart-
ments with a great number of
student majors will have more
than two advisors. For in-
stance, there will be three ad-
visors for the pre-medical
program.

Phillips stressed the need for
congenial cooperation. ‘‘It’s got
to work informally,” he said.
“The efficiency of the operation
is going to depend entirely on
the relationships between the
faculty and the people on the
committees. We need dip-
lomats,”’ he added.

There will be a list of mem-
bers of the Council out before
Winter term so that they can be
contacted if help is needed
students. Volunteers are st
being sought, and any student in
one of the various majors is en-

everyone to attend.”’

Pollution Symposium

On Tuesday, November 6 the Davidson Center for Honors
Study will sponsor a symposium on “Air Pollution and the
Production of Power’ in Hodson Hall. All speakers will be
from the National Environmental Research Center at
Research Triangle (NERC/RTP) of the U. S. Environmental
Protection Agency. Director of the Honors Center Earl Mac-
Cormac said, “‘This symposium will provide an excellent op-
portunity for students and others to become more aware of
the seriousness of the air pollution problem. I strongly urge

Phillips has been disap-
pointed in the response to the
program so far. ‘‘Most of the
people we've gotten for this
we've had to recruit. It says
something bad about the
student body,” he commented.

Phillips added that most of
the big glamour issues are gone
and that students now have a
valuable opportunity to con-
centrate on other issues which
can make life at Davidson more
pleasant.
