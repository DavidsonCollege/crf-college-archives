The Wildcat Wrestlers went back and
forth with The Citadel, but were unable to
come out on top Sunday, in the final home
match of the 2008-2009 season. The 22-16
decision pushed the Citadel to 9-4-1 overall
and 3-1 in Southern Conference competition,
while the loss dropped the Wildcats to 5-12
overall and 1-4 in SoCon matches.

David DeCamp ’12 got the Wildcats off
to a solid start with a 6-2 win over David
Ivanschenko in the 149 pound weight class
match. DeCamp’s win put the Wildcats up
3-0. In the 157 pound weight class, Carl
Sandercock *10 extended the Wildcat lead to
9-0 by pinning Keith Koziel in 2:57. The Cit-
adel took the 165 and 174 pound weight class
matches which tied up the score at 9-9. The
Citadel’s Derek Sickel pinned Tyler Mullen
712 in 1:39 and in the 174 pound match, J.C.
Oddo defeated Kevin Cook ’09 6-1, which
tied the match.

The Wildcats were able to take the lead
back briefly when Sam O’Hair ’09 defeated
Kelby Smith 13-4 in the 184 pound match.
O’Hair’s victory put the Wildcats up 13-9.
The Citadel came right back and tied the

match at 13-13, when Odie Delaney defeat-
ed Jorge Estrada ’12 11-1 in the 197 pound
match. The Citadel took the momentum in
the match when Aaron Brown defeated Char-
lie Wolff ’11 3-1, which put the Citadel up
16-13. If Wolff had been able to pull through,
the Wildcats would have taken the momen-
tum into the final three matches. In another
extremely close match, Taylor Sim defeated
Ben Altman ’10 3-2, which pushed the Cita-
del’s lead to 19-13. The Wildcats were able to
make one final push in the 133 pound match
when Alex Radsky *11 defeated Richard
Alarcon 8-4, which cut the lead to 19-16.

The 141 pound match decided the win-
ner of this meet. If Vitaly Radsky °1] had
beaten Derek Royster by more than seven,
the match would have gone to the Wildcats.
Unfortunately, Royster got the upper-hand
against Radsky and the Citadel won the
match by a final tally of 22-16.

On Friday, the Wildcat wrestlers traveled
to Anderson, S.C. for a Tri-Meet against An-
derson University and Belmont Abbey.

The Wildcats started their evening against
Belmont and impressed with a dominant
performance. Belmont actually started the
meet on top as Chris Neidermeier defeated
Ben Altman 710 in the 125 pound match 9-7,

by David DeCamp 712, Tyler Mullen 712,
and Kevin Cook ’09. The Wildcats took the

In the other match against Anderson, Da-

which put them ahead 16-8. In the 184 pound
match, Sam O’Hair ’09 kept the Wildcats in
the match with a 5-4 win over Luis Audelo.
O’Hair’s clutch win cut the Anderson lead to
16-11. Anderson won the 197 pound match
which virtually sealed a win, as they pushed
their overall lead to 20-11. In the 285 pound
and final match, Charlie Wolff ’11 defeated
Jonah Adams 5-2. Wolff’s win cut the Ander-
son lead to 20-14, but it was too late.

The Wildcats will head to Pittsburgh, PA

meet against Duquense, before finishing the
season in Charleston, S.C. with the Southern
Conference Tournament.

Butler

Belk Arena will host a nationally tele-
vised game on Saturday for the second time
in three weeks. This time, the opponent will
be the No. 21 Butler Bulldogs, coming to Da-
vidson as part of ESPN’s series of Bracket-
Busters games. Game time is noon.

The match-up, a chance for Davidson
to enhance its resume for the NCAA tour-
nament next month, has the dark specter of
injury hanging over it. Davidson’s star guard
Stephen Curry ’10 sprained his left ankle in
last Saturday’s 75-60 victory over Furman.
X-rays taken on Sunday were negative, and
at press time Curry was listed as day-to-day
by team sources. It was not known whether
Curry would be available for either this game
or Wednesday’s game against The Citadel.

If Curry cannot play, Davidson would
take on the Butler without the player who has
scored 36% of the team’s points and assisted
on 41% of the team’s field goals. He leads
the nation in scoring with 29 points per game
and is tied for seventh with 69 steals. He is
also shooting 39% from three-point range.

Butler is led by Matt Howard and Gordon
Hayward, who each average 13.8 points per
game and who pull down 7 and 6.4 rebounds
per game, respectively. The 6’8” Hayward
also leads the team with 41 steals and shoots
46% from beyond the arc. Howard, who also
stands 6’8”, leads the team with 41 blocked
shots. The Bulldogs’ leading facilitator is
Willie Veasley, who has recorded 90 assists
while averaging 12.2 points per game. -

The ’Cats will look to counter Howard
and Hayward with Andrew Lovedale ’09,
who is second on the team with 12.2 points
per game and leads the team with 8.8 re-
bounds per game.

Butler started the season by winning 19
of its first 20 games and climbing to the No.
11 spot in national polls. The only loss in this
sequence was a three-point defeat at Ohio
State. The Bulldogs have since lost twice in
Horizon League play, falling 75-66 at Green
Bay on February 2 and 71-67 to Loyola of
Chicago on Sunday.

Butler was seeded seventh in the East
Region of last year’s NCAA tournament and
fell in overtime to second-seeded Tennes-
see in the round of 32. Two seasons ago, the
Bulldogs reached the Sweet 16 before falling
to the eventual national champion Florida
Gators.
