SENIOR-FRESH.

Tn a hard-fought game last Thursday
night the Seniors defeated the Fresh by
the score of 17 to 7: Neither side play-
ed up to the standard in the first half,
with roughness the outstanding feature.
On account of the absence of two of the
Seniors’ best men, Price and Henderson.
the Fresh had all the better of it with
the score 3 to o when the whistle blew
for the first half. But the Seniors forg-
ed ahead in the second half and by their
fast work in the last few minutes won
the game. Price and Murray starred

SENIOR-JUNIOR.

Friday night the Juniors met defeat
at the hands of the fast Seniar team, the
final score being 19 to 14. Both teams
plaved fine ball. During the first half
of the game the Juniors seemed to have
most advantages, but after the rest be-
tween the halves the Seniors came back
with a rush. Bv gond team work they
overcame the Tuniors’ lead and merged
victors. ‘The floor work of Sprunt and
Mountcastle for the Tuniors was one of
the game's features, while the goal shoot-
ing of Hawkins for the same team was
great.

For the Seniors the work of Murrav
and Young showed up best, although
Price played his usually steady game.

Students to Raise Sum _ (Lecture to be Given

For War Prisoners

Tomorrow Afternoon

Davidson to Have Share In Relief|Y.M.C. A. Secures Well Known

Work Among Prison Camps.

Mr. W. H. Morgan, Traveling Sec-
retary of the International Committee
of the Y. M. C. A., was here Thursday
night and Friday in the interests of the
nation-wide campaign now being con-
ducted in the schools and colleges of
the country for the purpose of raising
a relief fund for the students and pro-
fessors in the prison camps of Europe.

At a meeting of the Y. M. C. A.
cabinet on Thursday night, Mr. Mor-
gan discussed the plans for raising the
sum necessary for the proposed werk,
and also outlined the conditions now
existing among. the prisoners of the na-
tions at war. At this meeting the mem-
bers of the cabinet pledged the sum of
$67.50 as the basis of the fund to be
raised among the Davidson students.

Instead of holding the regular chapel
exercises on Friday morning, Dr. Mc-
Connell turned over the time to Mr.
Morgan, in order that he might outline
the situation to the Student Body as a
whole. He summarized existing condi-
tions in the campus thus: There is a
shortage of rations, and those available
are in many cases unplatable; because
of the crowded conditions, cleanliness
has almost become unknown; the forced
inactivity, loneliness and despair of the
confined men is having a terrible effect
on the men and many of them are going
insane through melancholy and brood-
ing. An outline of the work being done
by the Y. M. C. A. workers in the
camps was given, the Y. M. C. A.
“huts,” the work of the secretaries, the
religious meetings, the medical work.
and the distribution of literature, being
described. Tn closing, Mr. Morgan told
of the sacrifices which hate, in numbers
of instances, heen made by college men
of this country in order to assist in send
ing aid to these workers and to provide
for the necessities which will be requir-
ed for the coming winter. An appeal
was then made for the men of Davidson
to respond to the call and in the spirit
of sacrifice to forego some of the pleas-
ures which they had planned for the
year and devote the funds to the cause
of relief. .

On Friday night a mass meeting of
the cabinet and their committees was
held, in which $78.50 was pledged and
the plans made for a canvass of the
Student Body, which was made that
night. Reports from this canvass have
not all come in yet, but a considerable
sum has been promised, altho the amount
has not vet reached the $1,000.00 which
was set by the committee as the contri-
bution which they felt Davidson ought
to make to this fund.

NEW BOOKS FOR LIBRARY.

The Library has been presented with
the following books on Labor Prob-
lems: ‘Land Questions,” “Social Prob-
lems,” “A Perplexed Philosopher,”
“Progress and Poverty,” all by Henrv
George; “The Tariff,” bv Lee Francis
Tvbarger: “Natural Taxation,” by

Speaker For Two Addresses.

Tomorrow afternoon at 4 o'clock, in
Shearer Hall. Dr. Seerly, of Spring-
field, Mass., will give a lecture before
the Student Body on the subject of
“Sex Hygiene and Education.” He
will also speak again at might at 7
o'clock, at the regular meeting of the
Y. M. C. A. and his lecture at this
time will be along the same line. Dr.
Seerly is a noted lecturer and a man
who has accomplished a great deal in
his field. He is sent out by the [oter
national Conunittee of the Y. ML C.
A., to lecture to the college men of the
South, and is now on a tour of these
institutions, coming here from the col-
leges of Georgia and South Carolina.

THE LAST TWO GAMES.

The game with Wofford tomorrow
should easily add another to Davidson's
victory column. Wofford has a serap-
py team, but lacks the experience and
weight necessary to cope with a big
team.

Interest is centered chiefly now on the
Clemson game on Thanksgiving, — at
Charlotte. ‘The last two games played
between these two teams resulted in’ tie
scores, ane this vear Davidson should be
able to get the better of their heavier
rivals and onake the victory clean-cut
and decisive. Clemson has by no means
a weak team, but as evidenced by the
games already plaved this vear, the Red
and Black squad has equaled the best
and vanquished all others. Clemson
held Citadel to a clase scare, 3-02 but
that is no reason why Davidson should
not score a more decisive victory, At
all odds it will be a hard-fought battle
and every student should he at Charlorte
Thanksgiving, no matter what happens.

A HOLIDAY ‘TRIP TO
CUBA BEING PLANNED

Dr. T. W. Lingle is making plans to
conduct a party on a holiday trip to
Cuha, December 20th to January grid.
Among the places to be visited are Tack
conville, St. Augustine, Orlando, Dav-
tona, and Miami. and nine days will be
spent in Cuba. °babission stations, coffec
and sugar plantations, and other places of
interest will be visited in excursions from
Havana. Altogether the trip should be
a very. instructive and enjovable one for
any student or alumnus to take, as Flor-
ida and the West Indies are most inter-
esting sections. Dr. Lingle has had
considerable experience in leading tour-
ist parties, having taken several over
different parts of Europe. Any one in-
terested in taking this trip to Cuba dur-
ing the holidays is asked to communi-
cate with him.

A NEW BOARDING HOUSE.

Mr. L. A. Elliot has practically made
arrangements for opening a $15 a month
boarding house on December st, in the
house just above the Henderson Hotel.
A Mrs. Harris and daughter have heen
secured to give their entire time to the
work, and FE. P. Childs has heen named
as manager.

MR. J. H. MILLING.

The sympathy of the Student Body
goes out to J. W. Milling, ’20, in the
tragic death of his father, Mr. J. H.
Milling, of Rock Hill. S.C. Mr. Mill-
ing was struck by a Southern Railway
train one mile south of Rock Hill on
the night of November 14th. He had
just been out to his farm and was hur-
rying back to the city in his automobile,
and did not see or hear the approach of
the oncoming train until the locomotive
was almost upon him. His machine was
crushed into kindling wood. and death
was instantaneous. Mr. Milling was
about fifty years old. and was a leading
wholesale grocer and farmer.
