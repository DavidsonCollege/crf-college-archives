The DAVIDSONIAN September 1, 1917

DAVIDSON’S OPENING
POSTPONED ONE WEEK

It has been decided to postpone the
opening of the college until Tuesday,
the 13th of September. Please note
the change and let it be known as gen-
erally as possible.

There are several reasons for the
change. So far as we can tell, with
every department of our family and
national life so disturbed, the prospects
for the college are good. The reasons
for postponement have almost entirely
to do with the convenience of the stu-
dents and their home people. The first
week of September. our regular open-
ing time, will see a tremendous move-
ment of troops. The 13th comes be-
tween the first and second movement.
Many students need the extra week this
fall to get their farm and other work
in as good shape as possible before leav-
ing. The other colleges of our section
open the week of the 13th.

The very unrest due to the draft and
the war generally has kept many from
definitely deciding as to their course, and
the extra week will give them time to

decide.

IMPORTANT CHANGES
MADE IN A.B. COURSE

The change made in the A.B. course
is as follows: Change the B.S, 1 course
1o A.B. 2, requiring students to take
either Greek or Latin, and either French
or German. One of the foreign lan-
guages must ‘be taken two years, and
four vears of foreign language all to-
gether must be taken in the Freshman
and Sophomore years.
