a
Vietnam: Peace Now

We now have 430,000 American Soldiers in \ietnam. They have been kept there
at a cost of 50,000 men and $8 million per hour.

Consider the Moratorium.

Undeniable Obligations.

Though Davidson “believes that
its purpose is promoted or hindered
by the quality of the total life of the
college community,” we will welcome ©
next week the members of the con-
tinuing corporate community and
again skirt major crisis areas of the
college.

The occasion is a meeting of the
Board of, Trustees which has not
scheduled consideration of the com-
mission reports on Social Patterns or
Extra-Campus Responsibilities in’ its
agenda.

None, of us can forget-that three
times in the past, major studies have
been made on the state of the cam
pus social life, and this spring. will
see another board meeting pass with-
out any substantive action more
than five years after the first recom-
mendations.

Furthermore, the area of concern
considered most relevant to students,
the question of 24-hour open dorms,
will be sidestepped for consideration
of board structure and elections.

Surely no one on campus could
have thought that these were the most
pressing, matters. Have we had so
little foresight to set priorities, or
worse just so little interest to pursue
the urgent. albeit more difficult ques-
tions? : :

Some problems are of particular
moment and should not»vait six
months for decisions. Outstandingly,

Too Long

The exciting problems in the Da-
vidson Court system are now likely
to continue to exist for another term.
It is unfortunate but true that the
trustees will do nothing to relieve
the situation at least until their gen-
eral review of the Code of Responsi-
bility next fall. :

Moving sluggishly, as most move-
ments in older bodies tend to be
sluggish, the trustees have apparent-
ly decided that the situation is not
serious enough to warrant special
action this spring.

We beg to differ. The situation is
indeed. serious and every student in
this school stands an all too frighten-
ing chance of being seriously hurt
by the system. ;

Something must be done. While it
is unlikely that the trustees could
take effective action without prolong
ed study of the issues, they should
act at the meeting next week to pro-
tect students from potential danger.

We recommend that the trustees
pass a resolution which would pre-
vent a student being suspended from
school by a college court until the
present courts system is reviewed.

Such a resolution would not prevent
the courts from acting on cases dur-
ing the next few months. They would

the question of open dorms looms
before us in the face of the faculty's
nay vote with such slight concern as
to offer no recommendations for fu
ture-action to the students who sought
to reconcile the code with the com-
munity,

Increasingly students are address-
ing their concern to the judicial sys-
tem. In light of the admitted .ques-
tioning of its oWn members it seems
that this would becdeemed a matter
due immediate attention. In line with
this, we must muster the courage to
stand behind a viable policy on drug
use, hopefully one with therapeutic
rather than penal orientation.

Indeed the continuing community
must show a_ definite commitment
not only on these matters but’ also
on the larger question of co-educa-
tion and college interest in student
living patterns.

The trustees, we think, should be
concerned over the faculty’s lack of
concern or slowness to action and
even more perhaps in their own
scanty agenda — which together with
February’s athletics represents their
entire year’s work.

“Students are expected to develop
social skills and relations which are
mutually beneficial and which lead
to personal maturity.’’ We look to the
faculty and trustees for direction.
The trustees should feel ‘both free
and obligated to wrestle’ with these
problems.

To Wait

merely be prevented from issuing a
sentence of suspension. as long as
there is significant doubt about their
powers and procedure.

A student would be allowed to con-
tinue to take courses and receive
credit until his case could be review-
ed by revised and competent courts.

It is all too evident that the courts
which exist at present are not com-
petent. They are hamstrung by a few
deficiencies which could be corrected

but which will apparently be ignored

by the trustees.

All the courts desperately need a
complete and comprehensive set of
Written procedures. There needs to
be a resolution of the problem of
court bias and a new system of pros-
ecution is needed. The problem of
college court authority with regard
to drug cases needs to be studied
and settled. And the publication of
court proceedings needs to follow
certain written procedures.

These problems (and there may be
others) need attention. If the atten-
tion is not forthcoming, the trustees
should act at once to preserve the
sense of community on the campus.
Not one student should be hurt be-
cause of an omission in the trustees’
agenda.

Student Protection

Faculty will usually’ say that stu-
dent-faculty relations are exgellent in
Davidson's small college atmosphere
You will probably get the same view
from a member of the administration
or from the college catalogue. But
ask a member of the Ad Hoc Com
mittee for the Protection of Students
about the same issues.

He will probably say that yes, stu-
dent-faculty relations are good. And
he will probably add, “But don’t get
complacent.”

The treatment of several seniors
by the Curriculum Requirements
Committee (CRC), the Faculty Execu-
tive Committee (FEC) and the Ad-
missions Committee fully justifies
that caution. Students and faculty are
not supposed to be in opposing camps

and the hostility with which several.

students were treated by the CRC and

the FEC is neither excusable nor un-

derstandable.
The main issues in the contrd*ér-
sy seem to be: first, apparent incon-
sistencies in administration of policy
by the CRC, and second, a mishandl-
ing of several students by both the
CRC and the Admissions Committee.
The documentation of cases by the
Ad Hoc Committee is apparently com-
plete and accurate. If that is correct
then it does seem that students should
get behind the Ad Hoc Committee

and give it unqualified support.

We see no reason for the treatment
given students. Given the transitional
nature of. the educational period
through which we are going, it is in-
evitable that unusual cases appear.
{t might have been expected that a
degree of leniency would have been
shown to those who were, to para-
phrase Browning, caught between two
worlds. This was not the case.

Further it does not seem 'reason-
able that students should have met
hostility partly because of their views
toward ROTC. They say that such
did happen in CRC meetings. We be
lieve that the college should let the
ROTC department handle its own
problems without confusing them in
our own curricular struggles.

To prevent the present mistinder-
standing from recurring. in the im-
mediate future, two steps might. be
taken: (1) the compilation and full
explanation of rules regarding cur-
riculum and readmission of students
and (2) the recognition of a student's
right to appeal cases in this area to
the full faculty.

A careful answering of these ques-
tions would reduce the chance of
further incidents similar to the one
now in question and would alleviate
the need for an Ad Hoe Committee
for the Protection of Students.

Review; Critic Explains Humor

To the Editor:

The reaction I had after
reading Tom Sinks’ review
of the Princeton Chamber
Orchestra concert must
have been similar to that
elicited from the readers of
the pre-Paul Hume Wash-
nigton Post who discovered
in a review of a National
Symphony concert that
“Mr. Mitchell is a very ver-
satile conductor.

with his right hand, but he

Assuming he did not en-

The first task of a critic is to
determine why his reaction
to a concert is either favor-

they get that “‘B’ and can

that is fine with them.

Maybe my cynicism is

| think you show a commendable interest in
world affairs and Davidson College affairs. albeit I
think you are misguided. But the rate which mail
has been pouring forth from your Murrells Inlet, S.
C., sanctuary has been driving our editor up the wall.

Freedom of the press is one thing, but vou, Mr.
Thornton, are quite another. However, our paper has
a policy of printing all authenticated letters, and yours

are authentic relics.

If you write any more, Shoaf will do more than
mumble about cancelling your subscription. Your
brand of effete honkyism graces our editorial page
with a certain fertilizer-like quality.

Speaking of gracing the editorial page, if the fan-
tastic oversight which allowed the printing of Sinks’
review last week is repeated, I will resign.

You may be interested in further events taking
place on campus since your old friend Julian Bond
left. Right after that we had Dean Rusk.

Rusk, whom we refer to as “The Honorable”
for his contribution ‘to the slaughter in Vietnam, left
a number of questions unanswered in various ques-
tion and answer sessions during his visit here. Not
the least of these was how much his Davidson exper-
ience contributed to his complete incapacity to see

the war as a moral issue.

Norman Johnson says that Rusk really believes
that the United States is a monarchy. He must have
imbibed it from the presidents he served under, par-

ticularly the latter.

For example, several times during his visit here,
Rusk referred to the Cabinet as ‘the President’s
court.” He thinks of the Secretary of State as the

President’s chief minister.

Evidently, the Nixon Administration also holds

.this view. Tricky Dick frequently refers to his daugh-
ter Tricky Tricia as “our Princess.” Having married

one daughter off to political royalty, he is now
scheming to get the other one married to Prince

Charles.

_. Mr. Rusk, at any rate, left us amazed by his ex-
citing ability to mouth the platitudes we have been
hearing for the last ten years. 2
__On other fronts, the Admissions Office —in—a—fit
of escalating tokenism, proudly announced that 16
black students, have been accepted for next year.
This truly magnanimous gesture shows once again
What a liberal campus we are.

And we owe our liberality to a similarly magna-

nimous group that has been

prominent in the news

recently, the “continuing college community.”

All the residents of Davidson, continuing-or-not;
know that the “continuing college community” —
recently brought. to our attention by Dr. Sam Spencer
—consists of Spencer and his continuing flunkies.

With the continuing college community watching
out for us mere transients here,*you don’t have to
Worry about us succumbing to evil influences, Mr.
Thornton. The c.c.c. will protect us.

: As we all know, the continuing college community
is responsible for all of the many advances that have
been made-in Davidson’s recent history.

Among other things, they put over that curricu-
lum reform they were all so pleased about a couple of

years ago. Recently

the Curriculum Requirements

Committee has been affirming the sacredness of our

wonderful new curriculum,

and some ungrateful stu-

dents have had the temerity to resenf this.
_ This past week at Davidson there were some
noticeable divisions along the student front. Two

groups appeared,
War People:

the Ecology People and the Anti-
the Ecology People, with Straight Pat
Mullen as their ‘short-haired leader, and

the Anti-

War People, with Peter Hobbie representing that rag-

ged group as their self-appoi
