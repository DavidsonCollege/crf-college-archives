Butner Emphasizes Housing,
Governance Among Priorities

By MIKE TANNER
Executive Editor

Last week, Blain Butner
defeated his three contenders
on the first ballot and became
the 1974 SGA President. In an
interview this week, he
discussed those aspects of his
campaign platform on which
he hopes to focus attention
during the coming year.

Butner spoke first of the
Student Advisory Councils
that he has supported this fall.
These recently-formed bodies
consist of students who will
act as liasons between the
student body and the respec-
tive academic departments.
The eee council for each

department will advise and in-
form both students and faculty
of the comments and
suggestions of each other.
“These groups will coach
the students, but more im-
portant, the faculty will get
some sort of feed-back if they
want it too, ‘he said.
Building priorities and
governance will also com-
mand much of Butner's at-
tention this year. He strongly
supports the Trustees
coeducation program which
will increase the student body
to 1500 by 1980. ‘‘Building
priorities and coeducation go
hand in hand. If Davidson
doesn’t soon decide to build

new housing facilities and do
it, we won't have any place to
put the women who will be
coming in. Somebody in the
Administration is dragging his
feet.”

In his campaign platform,
Butner especially favored a
thorough examination of the
present physical education
system. “‘There’s so much
chaos involving the PE
program that it really needs to
be codified. This means
organizing the schedule and
the requirements,”’ he said.

Butner indicated that he has
talked with Quips and Cranks
Editor-elect Carrol Ensley. He
hopes that the senate can work
with the yearbook staff to help
them turn out an edition more
to people’s liking than this
year’s.

He wants the senate to push
changes in the educational
requirements and feels that
the drop period should be
lengthened and that night
exams should be implemented
before the winter term ends,
if possible.

“The faculty knows how we
feel about these issues, but it’s
still to our advantage to con-
tinue to let them know.”

Finally. Butner expressed
himself on governance. As
president of the SGA, he is en-
titled to sit in on Faculty
meetings. No other students
are allowed to attend these
meetings and Butner hopes to
change this. He would also
like to see more students sit-
ting on the Educational Policy
Committee (EPC).

“It’s going to take more
than three students on these
committees to adequately
represent the student body.
More student involvement in
these committees will create a
broader channel for student
input. The more of us that sit
on the committees, the more
we can insure that all possible
student opinions will be ex-
pressed to the faculty in
making decisions,’ he con-
cluded.

The Class of 1975 selected
Senson Hardgrove, Bob
Lautensack and Rick Mullen
to serve on its Hearing Com-
mittee, while John Walters

nad Key Student Leaders Elected

and Mullen were elected to the
Review Board. Due to when
prohibiting service in

Review Board and Hearing
Committee simultaneously ;
Shaul Sadelick will take
Mullen’s place on the Review
Board.

The freshman class elected
Deborah Davis, Sue Johnston
and Tony Snow to the
Hearing Committee.

Many positions were filled
before the election. Junior
Mike Tanner became Editor
of THE DAVIDSONIAN,
Sophomore Frazier Marsh
President of the Union, junior
Tom Tornee President of the
Social Council, senior Rob
Strand and junior Barry
Blakely will Co-edit the 1974

Wildcat Handbook and
juniors Eric Walker and Steve
Can will co-edit the

1974 ‘Miscellany’. These can-
didates were una and

no elections were held for the
offices.

Many Davidson students awoke to a surprise Monday mor-
ning. Between 5 and 6 inchs of snow had fallen in the early hours

of the morning.
