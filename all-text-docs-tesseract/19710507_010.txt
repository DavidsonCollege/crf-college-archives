To Involve

By ALEC HOON
News Editor

On May 105, the David-
son community will engage
in “Clean-up Week", a time
designed to restore some of
the town's eyesores and pol-
lution problems and to im-
prove relations ‘between ail
elements of the local com-
munity.

Some of the projects in-
cluded will be ‘to remove and
scrap inoperable automobiles
and washing machines, to
clean up the entrances and
exits to the town, \and to re-
duce the pollution in Algae
Pond, a body of stagnant
water in the town.

According to Director of
Alumni Activities Howard B.
Arbuckle, ‘‘The week is de-
signed to get all elements of
the community to work to-
gether to @lean up Davidson.

“May 15, designated ‘Town
Day’ will be a celebration: of
the ‘accomplishments of the
week, involving townspeople,
white and black, and mem-
bers of Davidson College.

“It is designed to bring
everyone together, to im-
proye the relationships be-
tween different elements of

280 Students To Attend

By DOUG BROWN
Asst. Managing Editor
As of yesterday 280 stu-

‘dents have’ informed the Of-

fice of Admissions that they
decided to attend Da-
vidson next year as freshmen.

Of the rest accepted 204
have decided not to attend
Davidson, and chey have
withdrawn their applications.

The Office of Admissions
has projected a class of 300
for the Class of 1975, ‘and As-
sistant Director of Finaricial
Aid Peter V. Sterling be-
Leves that this goal will be
met. A total of 569 have been
accepted so far.

Five individuals have in-
formed (‘Davidson that they

then [ look around and see
other guys buying their way
out. Its politics, thats the
game.

Tad and Cleave suggested
that a parole board be es-
tablished in each prison unit
so that there would be some
personal contact between the
board and the inmates.

“Tf a man is serving a life
sentence, comes up for’ pa-
role, and is turned down, he
gets discouraged,"’ said
Cleave. And when no réason
is given, “he begins to look
for a way out.”

Cleave described how one
prisoner had his girl bring
him parts of a gun every
time she came to visit while
he put the gun together in
his cell.

“That guy escaped suc-
cessfully but he was one of
the smarter ones that had
been in the prison,"’ said
Cleave. ‘‘Most of ‘the guys
try to buy off a lawyer to
get them out.’

Both Tad and Cleave, how-
ever, were optimistic about
some of the new develop-
ments in the penal system.
At some correctional institu-
tions prisoners can go to
school six days ia week to
take courses. which eventu-
ally lead to ta high school

diploma. '
Some units also have a

group therapy sessions.

are no longer interested in
Davidson.

The Office of Admissions
has accepted some of those
on the waiting list, and ac
cording to Sterling, “‘This is
nét an abnormal! procedure.”

A profile of the Class ol
1975 telling college
board scores, class rankings,
the number of those who let
tered in a varsity sport, and
related subjects is not pres-
ently available, but it will
be prepared fairly soon, Ster
ling believes.

In an attempt to explain
the difficulties of the Office
of Admissions, Sterling said,
“All private institutions are
experiencing a decreasing
number of applications.”
Sterling pointed to tight mon-
ey, inflation, and _ rising
costs as reasons for this de-
cline.

“State institutions are also
facing financial . problems
because state legislatures are

ed Tad. “Some guys will

Both Cleave and Tad agreed
that outside volunteers are
needed to help the prisoners
to adjust, but people jin so-

because they see only the

“There are those students
who see the merits of a Da .

that they would involve them-
selves in the admissions pro-
cedure,’ said Sterling. Ster-
ling noted that visiting ath-
letes received the red carpet
treatment, and he feels, that
the student body should show
as much concern for other
visiting students.

Davidson was unable to
meet the full financial need
for some applicants — this
year, and the Office of Ad-
missions has not noticed a
large difference in return be-
tween these applicants and
those who had no need.

‘We are somewhat  sur-
prised by this, and it appears
that very few will. be unable
tovattend Davidson because
of financial reasons,’* com-

‘mented Sterling.
