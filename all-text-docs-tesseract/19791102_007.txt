Wrestlers prepare for winter season

~ By ROB MOORE
Staff Writer
Davidson's wrestling team
has begun its preseason drills in
preparation for a year that
includes many formidable
Southern Conference foes.

Senior Co-Captains Mike
Garfinkel and Rob King will
head a team whose season
begins Nov. 30 in the Catawba
wrestling tournament.

“It's kind of tough to predict
anything right now" comented
coach Estock. ‘*We still have to
see who we get after football
season.”

However, the wrestling team
does have some returnees al-

ready working out with the
team. Sophomore Scott Smith,
a returning letterman from last
year, is a promising prospect
who will probably be wrestling
in the 142 lb. weight class. Dave
Nichols and Pat McKenzie will
also add experience to the team.
Incoming freshmen who
could also help the team are Boe
Young, Van Wagnor, Scott
Campbell and Jim Brotherton.
Junior Dave Hopkins and se-
nior Greg Peters are also out
this year for the first time.
The team has mainly con-
cerned itself with conditioning,
weightlifting, and basic wres-
tling fundamentals thus far this
season. This will lead them into

demanding workouts before the
season begins,

Estock stated that one of his
central goals this season is
increased participation in the
wrestling program. ‘‘We're try-
ing to get as many people
involved as possible. We’re
looking for young men who
want to learn some skills and
ure willing to work hard. We
want to get all the young people
possible and build around ex-
perience."

When asked what the team’s
number one goal was, Estock
replied, “1 think it would be
great to have some first place
winners in the Southern Con-
ference Tournament.”

and Craig Pyles with 70 yards.

Al Khyne headed ‘the ‘passing.
with 199 yards on 12 comple- -

tions. Atkinson scored three
touchdowns, | two on rune and

one on @ pass,

Kevin Hanna tuimed in sev-
eral defensive gems as he‘ ‘inter-
cepted two passes and returned
one of them for a touchdown.

If it is possible to smile at
three losses, the Davidson soc-
cer team may have that satis-

faction. A team that has been

plagued with poor play as of
late, the Wildcats can. at least
take heart in playing much
better soccer last week despite
coming up short in the score.
Last Wednesday the soccer
team traveled to Boone for a
night game with mighty Appa-
lachian State. As usual, the
Mountaineers were awesome,
and have a national ranking to
prove their power, yet the
Wildcats held App. State to two
goals in the first half, before
falling to the inevitable 7-0
score. The game was extremely
rough. Bill Wahl and Mike
Iorodanov went down with in-
juries, and Jimmy Hawk was
ejected from the game. In
consolation, App. State’s coach
exclaimed that it was by far
their best performance of the
year, including those against
other nationally ranked clubs.
He praised Davidson’s tenacity.
Saturday Davidson ran into
an excellent Emory squad in a
home match. The Wildcats

_ ven though several fights

erupted, Coach Farrell was
happy the Cats ° ‘finally played
an emotional game." He added. -
“It was nice to avoid all those.
‘costly turnovers for. a , hee

Kremser said, “We pry can't

get the ball in the goal.” ~
Emory scored on three break- :

aways, due in part to the entire

Davidson team ‘pushing up to

help create offense. Todd Lam- .
bert did score a beautiful run-
ning goal off a perfect lead chip
from Scott Wall. The final 3-1
score was no indication of |
Davidson's spirited play.

Tuesday night Davidson tra-
veled to Charleston for a South-
ern Conference match with the
Citadel. Kremser called it one of
the squad’s “best efforts” des-
pite losing 2-1. The Citadel,
undefeated in Conference play,
came back from a 1-0 deficit
after Bill Wahl’s long 30 yard
shot by scoring on two set plays
after penalties. The encoura-
ging fact was the Wildcats
never gave up and battled until
the final whistle.

The Wildcats finish. their
season this week with two
weekend road matches— Friday
at Wofford and Sunday at
UT-Chattanooga—and climax
with the University of North
Carolina at home Wednesday.

Bonehead and Brick Brothers attempt to explain IMAC scheduling

By BONEHEAD and
THE BRICK BROTHERS
Greetings Davidsonians, wel-

come to another issue of Bone-
head and the Brick Brothers.
We have lots of good things for
you this week and we will start
everything off with a short ep-
istle from a couple of fresh-
mints. Close your eyes and en-
joy the experience.

Dear Bonehead and the Brick
Brothers,

Me and Marvin were sitting
under an apple tree and we were
thinking how amazing it was
that Born to Run had gone
through the season with an un-

blemished record. We were sur- ,

prised how a team with no at}-

letes or any semblance of organ- ”

ization could possibly do so

well.

Also, our freshman hall that
had a winless regular season
record only lost to them 14-13,
while losing to other jugger-
nauts like. SAE, KA, and
Hurtin 4 certin by scores like
56-3, 1000-7, 83-3. Our hall
counselors told us that we
would play B league in basket-
ball, but we thought the flicker-
ball divisions were supposed to

be equal. How can there be a
division with no competitive
teams?

We heard a rumor that the
person who’set up the divisions
is a card-carrying Born to Run
member. Is it not also true that
this same person who last year
merely held for kickoffs for
Ruskellar, is now a dynamic
part of the Born to Run offense?
What has happened to integrity
and the honor code? Just be-
cause one is a non-paid hard-
working commissioner, does it
give one the license to manipu-
late the IMAC scheduling?
What Godless atheism!

We would like to commend
B&BB for leaving this peripate-
tic team out of the Top 5. We
also think it would be a moral

injustice of the highest magni-

tude to include Born to Run in -

she same breath as such flicker-

ball powers as v SAE, KA, and
Hurtin 4 Certin, Also, we knos.
you are busy, but we'd like you
guys to come speak at one of
our hall meetings. Thank you.

Signed, Stuart Wicker

Dear Stuart,

We agree with your senti-.

ment arid would like to edify

everyone concerning the history
of IMAC frdént office corrup-
tion.

The stink began way back in .

1882 when IMAC tsar Woody
Wilson's team (coincidentally
named Born to Run) made it to
the flickerball finals after three

‘early round byes. Al Capone at
. the University of Chicago was

known to force games to go into
overtime until his team man-
aged to get. ahead. Tailback
Benedict Arnold once transfer-
red the night before a cham-
pionship game at William and
Mary to lead one of Oxford's
fraternities (the SPE’s) to a
world title.

Also, in one of the most
infamous games in North Caro-
lina flickerball history Dick
Nixon's Duke law team edged
Cora Nelson's UNC delta delta

from an illegal crackback block
by Nixon.
