Election Edition

In recent weeks a number of students
have expressed the desire for a pre-election
issue’ of THE DAVIDSONIAN, All have
voiced the complaint that it is impossible for
a single student to know everyone in a stu-
dent body of more than nine hundred and
fifty men. They have called upon the staff
to furnish them with information about all
candidates so that they may vote intelli-
gently. Altho the staff opposes organized
campaigning for a number of reasons, we
feel that this request can be granted with-
out exposing the members of the staff to
charges of having violated the provision in
the student constitution forbidding the
soliciting of votes. More important, we be-
live that for the good of the school the re-
quest should be granted.

No one is dissatisfied with the results of
last year’s elections. They do feel, however,
that we may not be so fortunate again. No:
voter anywhere should vote blindly, and that
is what we desire to prevent.

At the present time we have not com-
pleted our plans for carrying this project out.
This cannot be done until the Elections
Board puts its stamp of approval upon the
entire scheme. However, it is expected that
after this issue (which will contain the in-
formation about all men eligible for the posi-
tions of editor of the newspaper, the maga-
zine, and the annual), there will be a num-
ber of one-page special editions with facts
about all candidates for each’ office, These
specials’’ will be placed in the hands of
the students before the voting begins to en-
able them to become better acquainted with
the. qualifications of all men whose names
will appear on the ballot.

The danger lies in the way in which
these facts are presented. For this reason we
have decided to use the same form for each
candidate. The, information will consist of
(1) the candidate’s name, (2) his hometown,
(3) his campus activities (listed factually
only) and (4) his military record, if any.
We feel that this will make it impossible for
any one individual to gain an advantage over
another as the result of statements not based
purely upon facts.

We sincerely wish that it was possible to
print pictures of every candidate, but we

are unable to do so for two reasons. First,
the cuts niust be prepared in Charlotte. The
Alumni Office does not have mats or euts
of individual students. They do have pic-
tures, but it is impossible to have cuts made
from these pictures in less than 48 hours,
Therefore, in the case of the ‘‘special’’ is-
sues there is not sufficient time between the
nominations and the elections in whieh to
have this done. In the seeond place the costs
of such an operation are prohibitive, THE
DAVIDSONTAN does notemake a profit and
the limited funds available*from ads would
not be nearly enough to“inance such a great
undertaking. This is easily understandable
if one considers that more than sixty cuts
would be needed.

We not undertaking this: project
Without misgivings. It has never. been tried,
before, and none of us have had experience
with activities of this nature elsewhere. We
are undertaking it, nevertheless, Por we feel
that the students desire that-we-do so. It is
our policy to do everything possible to make

dent body, and we feel that this action is @

Step in that direction,

Iron Curtain

In last DAVIDSONTAN the
article “Tron Curtain Around the Campus”
was partially reprinted from the Presby-
terian Outlook, While “a large part of this
article was directed towards defects in cur:

week's

riculum and toward some faculties who do

not seek to relate the courses of their insti-~

tutions to life, another paragraph seemed
to come nearer to a solution for the David-
son Campus. This section brought forward
the that of the students on
American campuses do not care. That is, they
are interested only in what is happening on
their own campuses or in the cities in which

point many

they spend their week-ends:

We have, o
ing, such an attitude on our own eampus.
Either we do not care or we are so atraid
of the persecution that some individualistic
idea might receive that we pretend we do not
care, This indifferenee-totheaverld-outside
our “ivory towers’? is evident in the
letters received by the editor of THE
DAVIDSONTAN, These letters are primarily,
conceried with something which has hap-
pened on the Davidson campus. Last week’s
excellent comment of FEPC was one of the
few unsolicited statements weehave receivd
on state, national, or religious affairs, Such
a trend in the spontaneous writings of a stu-
dent body would certainly seem to indicate
that there is present an almost total lack of
concern for things which do not seem to
affect us directly.

“Why don't ‘ is that’ we have
never really stopped to consider everything
involved in the political issues of our nation
or in’ the religious problems facing the
church. When we go blissfully on unaware
of church and nation, do we realize that in
a few short will. either be the
leaders of the church and state or we will be
forced along by the tide of the opinions of
those who have prepared themselves for life
by the consideration of matters outside their
own egocentrie spheres.—J.W.M,

joined in to help bring about
this adjustment in our method
of conducting elections. This
plan is at best a poor substitute .
for knowing the candidates

believe it is much better than
knowing absolutely nothing
about the men running.
Another point to be remem-
