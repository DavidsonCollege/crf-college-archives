Faculty approves
EPC proposal for
double majors

By Beth Lindsey
Although Davidson has not

majors in the past, the Davidson
college faculty approved a recom-
mendation of the Educational
Policy Committee on December 6,
1994 allowing students to major
simultaneously in two different
departments. Any student who
fulfills all requirements may double

major, regardless of year.

Shandley was most concerned with
students’ safety on Friday night
rather than eliminating traditional
activities. But, Shandley said, “If
the traditional activity sends stu-

dents to the hospital, I want to

eliminate, not curtail it.”
Patterson Court Advisor Kurt
Holmes was also concerned with

students’ safety on Friday night.
He assigned nine police officers,
one to each house, to “prevent big
problems.” Those numbers con-
trast with an event like Homecom-
ing, where seven officers are as-
signed and rotate among the houses.

Shandley said the best way to
make Self-Selection night safer

was to create an “attitude change”’

among students. To affect this
attitude change, Shandley spoke
with each of the chapter presi-
dents and eating house presidents.
In his discussions with the presi-
dents, he stressed, “It’s not an

Student bone marrow donor to meet recipient

By Russ Tarver

Senior Megan Snyder never
expected to save a life when she
had her bone marrow typed during
her freshman year. A year later she
became a donor. This week she
will meet the recipient, a 46-year-
old father from New Jersey.

“T didn’t know much about it
when I had my marrow typed. I
didn’t really know what it meant,”
says Snyder.

Snyder and Richard Foucey, a
financial consultant with two sons,
have corresponded regularly since
the operdtion but
have never actually
met. “We wrote let-
ters to each other for
a year.”

In November of
1992, Snyder re-

eration, she consented to the trans-
plant which took place in April of
the next year.

“The Red Cross puts no pres-
sure on you, even after a match. If
anything, they try to talk you out of
it. The recipient doesn’teven know
you exist,” says Snyder. “I feel
like this was the best thing I’ve
ever done in my life.” She explains
that the procedure was relatively
easy. “They withdrew the marrow

from my pelvic bone while I was
under anesthesia. It wasn’t that
painful.” Ten days later she was
playing in a lacrosse tournament.

The Project Life committee
has invited Foucey to speak at 7:00
p.m. on Thursday. -

when a faculty member on the EPC
brought the idea to the attention of
the entire committee. The com-
mittee discussed it and researched
the policies of other colleges com-

colleges” surveyed, schools such
as Colgate, Furman, Oberlin,
Swarthmore, and Washington &
Lee, ‘all permit double majors.

Dean Rusk,
1909-1994:
Memories of a
distinguished
graduate

By David Shrinto bean

Davidson College: lost a most dis-. a
tinguished graduate. scholar,
statesman, and professor, when
Dean Rusk died at the age of 85 in
his home in Athens, Georgia. De-
spite the fullness of his life, many
will remember Dean Rusk only as
the vilified'‘Secretary of State who
engineered the United States’ Viet-
nam policy under Presidents
Kennedy and Johnson in the 1960s.
A more complete examination of
his life reveals personal qualities
that allowed Dean Rusk to make
important contributions to. the
world — and to Davidson.

The early years

Born in poverty in Cherokee
County, Georgia, Dean Rusk en-
tered Davidson in 1927. Four years
later, he had graduated Phi Beta
Kappa and had earned a Rhodes
scholarship to study at Oxford. At
Davidson, Rusk valued the
college’s emphasis on moral and
spiritual virtues and believed that
“Davidson clearly sought to pre-
pare its young men for lives of
service.”

Rusk began his life of service
as a political science instructor at
Mills College in California. Then,
in the 1940s and ‘50s, he rose to
prominent levels in the State De-
partment. In 1952 he accepted the
presidency of the Rockefeller
Foundation. After his election in
1960, President John F. Kennedy
