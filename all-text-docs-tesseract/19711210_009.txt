Wildcat Gridders Lose Sole Victory

WIN BOTCHED BY BUCKNELL BUS

Coach Dave Fagg’s protests over the forfeit of the Buck-

nell game were not allowed.

Tragedy has struck the tragic
— N.C.A.A. officials announced
Wednesday night that Davidson
has forfeited its only football
victory of 1971.

The Wildcats suffered through
a disasterous season which pro-
duced only one triumph, and
just recently learned that no
one on the squad made the
all-Southern Conference team.

Wednesday night, officials
from the rules committee of
the N.C.A.A. informed Davidson
that due to irregularities be-
fore their game at Bucknell on
Oct. 9, their 208 win was for-
feited to the host team.

The report explained that the
“irregularities” referred to prob-
lems the Wildcat team had in
getting to Bucknell. A mix-up
occurred with the driver of the
bus which was to carry the
team to the football stadium.

The bus met the squad at the
airport at Harrisburg, Pennsyl-
vania, but the driver confused
the ‘Cats with the Army team
and began to transport them to
College Park where the Cadets
were scheduled to meet Penn
State.

Before the mistake could be
detected, the bus had traveled
a considerable distance away
from Bucknell, and Davidson
did not arrive at the stadium

Coliseum Ousts Wildcats;
New Home Court Sought

Officials of the Charlotte Coli-
scum are considering terminat-
ing their agreement with David-
son College which allows the
college to play several basket-
ball games there each year.

These officials intimated this
possibility following the spase
“crowd” which viewed the re-
cent Davidson-Clemson contest.

In offering reasons for their
decision, a Coliseum spokesman
cited the fact that declining at-
tendance in recent years at
Davidson games has caused the
facility to lose money.

“There are so many more
events which we could attract
to the Coliseum, but we are
stymied as long as we let David-
son play here,” the spokesman
noted.

Among the more popular
drawing cards listed by the ‘of-
ficials are such top-flight per-
formers as The Osmonds, The
Cowsills, Championship Wrestl-
ing and Roller Derby.

Coupled with countless Check-
cr games, these attractions
leave little room on the sched-
ule for Wildcat games.

In addition to entertainment,
the University of North Caro-
lina at Charlotte 49ers will play
their entire home schedule in
the Coliseum. This, too, should
Provide interesting entertain-
ment.

Davidson officials were flab
bergasted by the decision, and
expressed concern about find-
Ng a suitable alternative.

“This took us completely by
Surprise, and we've been able
to work feverishly to find some-
Where else to play,” comment-
ed Athletic Director Tom Scott.

Scott mentioned that he had

suggested playing all the home
games in cozy Johnston Gym,
but this was turned down by
conference schools who feared
that they would not get a fa-
vorable share of the gate re-
ceipts.

The Greensboro Coliseum and
Greenville Memorial Auditorium
are other possfbilities being
considered to give the ‘Cats a
home. Both of these arenas are
withing easy driving distance,
a big plus in their favor.

until almost 1 p.m., an hour
before the scheduled kickoff.
N.C.A.A. officials pointed out
that major college rules require
that the ‘“‘team must arrive at
the host school’s football field
at least 90 minutes prior to the
scheduled kickoff time” in or-
der that game officials may
have time to talk over field
rules with the coaches and so
that possible uniform mix-ups
might be corrected in time.
Protests by Davidson spokes-
men saying that the fault was
the bus driver's and not their
own were rejected by N.C.A.A.
officials. The rules committee
also rejected a Davidson re-

‘ quest for an appeal.

Reactions by the football team
members were unanimous dis
may. All those interviewed
chose to remain anonymous,
but comments varied from ‘‘a
real heartbreak” to ‘‘an under-
handed way to take away our
only win.”

Most of those players consult-
ed felt that they really won the
game and that the rules com-
mittee’s action did not change
that anywhere but in the record
books.

On the other hand, a spokcs-
man for Bucknell’s  gridders,
who also asked to remain name-
less, expressed great joy in the
decision. ‘‘We really played our
hearts out that day,” he said,
“and we deserve the recogni-
tion this ruling brings to us.”

The Bucknell spokesman said
that Bucknell athletic officials
were unaware that any rule had
been broken, ‘‘although,” he
said, ‘‘we did realize that they

got here awfully late.” He also
Said that he was unaware that
the N.C.A.A. was considering
the issue. ‘‘They must have in-
itiated the action on their own,”
he remarked.

Due tv the ruling, Davidson's
record for the season is now
officially 0-10. The ‘Cats have
now lost 14 consecutive games
over the last two seasons. The
last team they beat was V.M.I.
midway through the 1970 sea-
son.

Scott To Propose
Voluntary P.E.

Director of Athletics Toin
Scott announced that he will
submit a proposal to the Ed-
ucational Policy Committee
asking that Davidson's physical
education program be made
fully voluntary.

Scott said that he felt that
the change made last year to
a proficiency test system had
made the present program “‘lit-
tle more than a joke.”

“We've had very few people
sign up for tests, he comment-
ed, ‘‘and almost no one takes
gym courses.”

Scott said that he was very
disappointed in the poor stu-
dent response to the present
system, and that his proposal
was intended to be “more real-
istic.”

Scott stated that he hopes the
EPC will act on his proposal
and possibly implement a fully
voluntary program before the
end of the year.
