No. 22

Council Advocates Plan
Changing Procedure For
Election of New Editor

Proposed Changes to be Pre-
sented to Student Body
After Investigation

APPROVAL SOUGHT
To Be Tabled For Ten Days

The Student Council passed
a proposed amendment con-
cerning the election of the
editor’ for the Davidsonian
last Monday night to be sub-
mitted to a vote of the student
body after rumors of combines
had reached it and investiga-
tions had been made.

After a deep and lengthy inves-
tigation of the rumors the council
resolved to place the Davidsonian
election under the direct supervi-
sion of the council this year. On
the basis of its evidence the coun-
cil. drew up an amendment which
was submitted to the student body
Tuesday morning, March 21.

“Proposed Amendment to the
Constitution of the Davidson Col-
lege Student Body, passed by the
Student Council, March 20, 1939.

“The editor-in-chief of the Da-
vidsonian shall hereafter be elected
from the six managing editors of
the present Junior Class by a com-
mittee composed of the editor-in-
chief, the associate editors, the
managing editors of the present
Junior Class, and the managing ed-
itors of the rising Junior Class. For
this election full attendance of this
committee shall constitute a quo-
rum.

“Each member of the commit-
tee shall be entitled to one vote.
A simple majority shall be neces-
sary for election. Voting shall be
by .secret ballot, elimination, by
dropping the lowest candidate in
each balloting.”

In discussing the proposed
amendment Fred Stair, President
of the Student Council, stated:
“The purpose of the proposed

amendment is not to favor nor dis-
favor any of the candidates elig-
ible for the office, but rather for
the good of the student body, and
for the good of the Davidsonian in
particular.”

The proposed amendment will do
away with political combinations
that may arise between any groups.
Men who have worked on the Da-
vidsonian editorial staff for three
years and at the least two years

will elect the editor-in-chief.
These men know the qualifica-
tions and the abilities of all the

six men eligible for the office. The
student body as a whole does not
know which of the candidates
better fitted for the editorship.

If the amendment is passed after
it has been tabled for ten days, it
will necessitate a revision in the
time of the selection of the manag-
ing editors from the rising Juniors
on the editorial staff. At the pres-
ent time they are selected after
the editor-in-chief has been elect-
ed. This amendment, if passed by
the student body, will cause the
new managing editors to be select-
ed before the editor is elected in
order to include them on the com-
mittee which will elect the David-
sonian editor. This matter of se-
lecting managing editors can be
changed easily, since there is no
law stating the specific time at
which they must be chosen.

Six Editors

Fifteen Students Vie for Jun-
ior Editor Positions on
Davidsonian

Fifteen men are eligible for
the six posts available on the
managerial staffs of the Da-
vidsonian next year.

These include; Phil Peyton, Bill
Hamilton, Ed Watson, Andy Dale,
Bob Williams, Miller Sproull, Tom
Cauble, Jamie McDuffie, Frank
Barker, Winston Taylor, Lawson
Withers, Paul Bumbarger, Joe
Liles, Ross McElwee, and Roy
Cunningham.

For the past two issues these
men have been instructed by the
present editors as to how the
make-up of the paper should be
constructed. Formerly, the Soph-
omores and the Freshmen have
just written the stories and heads
for the paper, and the Junior edi-
tors have had full charge of the
make-up until the period of tute-
ledge began with the last issue.

In this issue Winston Taylor
and. Frank Barker made up page
Cunningham, Sproull, Liles,
and Withers’ page three; Cauble,
Dale, and Williams, the sports
page; Jimmie McDuffie and Phil
Peyton, page five, and the last
page, Ross McElwee. Ed Watson
and Paul Bumbarger were assign-
ment editors.

The election of the six men to
manage the paper for next year will
be made by this year's staff.

Final Blueprints for the New
Dormitory Have Not
Been Selected

In a recent meeting the
Building and Grounds Com-
mittee decided that Davidson’s
new dormitory should be con-
structed on the vacant lot just
east of East Dormitory. Sev-
eral sites were discussed at
the meeting, but the Commit-
tee finally agreed to keep the

tact, and to have the new
building in line with Fast,

West, and Georgia.

As yet final blueprints for the
dormitory have not been selected,

At Meeting

Major Ballard Speaks
“General Allenby’s Cam-
paign in Palestine”

on

Major James L. Ballard,
professor of Military Science
at Davidson College, present-
ed a lecture to the student
body last Friday night on
“General Allenby’s Campaign
in Palestine.”

Invited to speak by the Bible
department, he compared Allenby’s
success in overcoming the Turks
with many military triumphs told
of in» the Bible, such as Joshua’s
conquest of Jericho. He then pro-
ceeded to outline the victories of
Allenby after he had succeeded
General Murray as commander of
the British around Jeru-
salem.

troops

First Campaign

He told of how General Murray
attempted to drive the Turks out
of Gaza, their stronghold, and his
failure. After Murray had attempt*
ed several attacks, failing each
time, he was succeeded by Gen-
eral Allenby.

Allenby made all his troop move-
ments under cover of night, and
attempted several cavalry raids
upon Beersheba, a town near Gaza
from which the Turks obtained
most of their water supply. After
Beersheba was captured the artil-
lery was used to fire upon Gaza,
which fell in late November, 1917.

Jerusalem was the next objective
of the English, whom by sheer de-
termination and will power Allen-
by drove toward the capital city
in the rain and mud. When Jeru-
fell December 11, the en-
tire region of Palestine was under
British control.

General Allenby, commented
Major Ballard, was a combination
of the best qualities found in Lee,
Grant, and Jackson. Though little
is heard of him today, he was one
of the most outstanding World
War generals, dying in London in
1936.

Spring Holidays

At 12:30 on Thursday after- | |
noon, March 23, the annual |
spring holidays for Davidson ||
College will begin. There will |
be a period of rest from studies
for about five days, and all stu- ||
dents will be expected back for
classes on the morning of Wed-
nesday, March 29 at 8:30.

The holidays this year do not,
as in several former years, come
during the Easter week-end.
Easter comes so late in the year
that it was impossible to wait |
until then for the spring vaca-
tion.

A number of students, who
will be unable to go to their
homes because they live too far
away, will remain here on the
campus during the five days;
and in contrast to this, several
students have already left for
their holidays.

Students who plan to take ex-
‘aminations or re-examinations
during this period of the year
should make the necessary ar-
rangements with Mr. Henge-

veld.

Seventy-Fifth Birthday
Observed By Magazine

Scripts ’N’ Pranks Publishes
Forty-Page Edition
to Celebrate

“Scripts and Pranks,” the col-
lege magazine, makes its appear-
ance for the 75th year on the cam-
pus this week. In the spring of
1864 the first issue of a David-
son College magazine was run off
the press to amuse and to display
the talents of the students.

Celebrating the anniversary of
this first publication the staff of
the “Scripts and Pranks” for this
year have turned out the largest
magazine ever edited by the stu-
dents.

The anniversary number contains
40 pages of conc®ntrated humor,
which is eight pages longer than
any previously published,.(and 40
more pages of humor than ever
before published). The cover was

done by Fred Harbin, chief car-
toonist on the staff.

One of the main features of the
issue is the comprehensive ques-
tionnaire on the likes and dislikes
of the students in regard to the
habits and character of the fem-
jinine multitude. Although not
much was learned by the question-
naire it gave the editors a chance
to make a few nasty remarks. |

Besides the cartoons, which are
more numerous than ever before,
there are several stories by Earle
Austin, Bob Ramsey, and Scotty
Raynal. The snap-shot page con-
tains pictures of the “boys” in
their off moments and the poet's
corner displays the high-minds of
several modern Byrons.

An un-paid advertisement was
broadcast over the loud-speaking
system at the student body as-

Seniors Plan
‘Faculty Day’

Class of ’39 Expects to Hold
Outdoor Function With
Faculty This Spring

several

Plans are rapidly being com-
pleted for an outdoor function be-
tween the Senior Class and Faculty
to be held sometime this spring,
according to Ovid Bell, chairman
of the committee for arrangements.

A definite date for the occasion
has not yet been fixed, but the af-
fair will probably be held late in
April. A whole afternoon will be
devoted to outdoor sports featur-
ing contests between Seniors and
Faculty members, such as golf, ten-
nis, horseshoes, and bowling.

After the sporting events mem-
bers of both groups will gather
around a bonfire for a barbecue
supper or some similar’ feed, after
which entertainment will be pro-

vided.
