Carrier current station almost ready

By ANN MITCHELL
Staff Correspondent -

‘WDSR(Davidson Student
Radio), a new student-run radio
station, will begin broadcasting
on the Davidson campus in
several weeks.

WDSR will’play all types of
music except classical. ‘‘We feel
like DAV has the classical
cornered on the Davidson cam-
pus,’ sophomore John Odell
said. Odell is spokesman for an
ad hoc committee that is get-
ting the station off the ground.

Tentative hours of broad-
casting are 10 a.m. to midnight
six days a week and 10 a.m. to
10 p.m. Saturdays, according to
Odell. Hours will depend on the
availability of help.

WDSR, broadcasting at 580

_AM, willbe a carrier current
station, one that transmits into
the College’s electrical system.
Students in alldorms will be

able to tune in simply) by |

plugging their radios into wall
outlets.

Students will also be able to
listen to WDSR over portable
radios from as far away as
Chambers.

Station headquarters are in
an old ROTC radio room in the
basement of Belk Dormitory.

WDAV is offering technical
asssistance to WDSR by pro-
viding several disc jockeys and
lending it some records. Also,
Odell said he plans to add to
WDSR’s current collection by
joining the mailing lists of

visibility at the expense of the
welfare of the athletes them-
selves.

A Southern Conference bas-

ketball championship was ‘‘pos-

sible and probable,” according

to the report. The basketball

_team should therefore continue

aying in Division TA as a

ber of the Southern Coa-
fernce.

ever, is not a realistic goal, the

The report contained no

major criticisms of the basket-

ball or football budgets..

The women’s athletic pro-
gram, however, was ‘described
as “underfinanced and under-
staffed” and ‘‘in serious viola-
tion of Title IX,"’ a federal
nate spending on men *s and
women’s athletics.

proportionate number of scho-

Other major recommenda-

—The Wildcat Club should
raise funds to replace the

athletic budget cut. This cut
put the present athletic pro-

Bingham new A.D.

By JOHN SIMAN
News Editor

Eugene Bingham, the Col-
lege’s new athletic director, is a
self-made man.

He has mined coal in West
Virginia and served as a top-
level insurance executive. He
has lived the American Dream

~ and brings that sort of philoso-

phy to Davidson athletics:
‘While we want to win, our true
goal is to strive to win. Winning
isn’t everything. Striving to
win is everything.”

Bingham officially replaced
outgoing Athletic Director
Thom Cartmill September 1,
though he actually started work
a week earlier. Cartmill is now
golf coach and professor of
physical education.

Bingham described his au-
thority and expertise as lim-
ited to personnel and financial
matters and emphasized that he
did not want to interfere with
coaches by being a ‘Monday
morning quarterback.’’ He ex-

plained, ‘‘My business is busi-

ness; it’s not coaching.”’ .
Money, Bingham said, is the
basic component of a successful
athletics program. He therefore
considers ‘‘organized fund rais-
ing efforts” to be the key means

New Post Office may spur town plans

By GLENN KELLUM
Assistant News.Editor
Davidson will have a new

post office within the next two .

and a half years, according to
College Business Manager Bob

building is necessary
Davidson's growing pop-
ulation, according to postal
officials.

Davidson Mayor Nancy Mac-
Cormac’ said the new facility

‘may be built behind ‘the Main

Street stores, a move she thinks
would spur the town’s plans to
upgrade the downtown area.
The United States Postal
Service leases the ‘post office

building from the College. The
original lease was signed in 1957
for a ten year period with two
additional five year options.

-The lease and the two options

expired in 1978.

Planning to build a larger
post office, the Postal Service
then asked for a lease ‘‘on. a
short term basis,” Currie said.
This lease ran for two years
with three one year options. The
first of the options is now in
effect. —

’ The College is considering
moving the Student Store to the
present post office when the
government finishes its own
building, Currie said. However,

Student Store Manager Peter
Nichols said he is ‘‘not in favor
of the idea.” Any new business
in the building will have to: be
compatible with both College
and town needs, MacCormac
said.

The town’s revitalization plan
for the downtown area is in its
early stages, with the new post
office playing a big part, Mac-
Cormac said. However, the
Davidson Town Council is ‘‘on

hold” until the Postal Service——

decides where to build the new
post office.
If the new post office is built
behind the Main Street stores,

for the Athletic Department to
accomplish its goals. However,
explaining that his fundraising
plans were ‘‘still in the forma-
tive stages’’ with ‘‘basic work
still to be done,”’ he declined to
describe them in any detail.
Bingham did say his fund-
raising efforts would depend on
‘interested alumni” who might,
for example, donate money
specifically to sports they felt
were worthy of support.
Bingham has read up on
recent controversies concerning
College athletic policy and sees

| a need to: improve opportunities

for women athletes and athletes
in non-revenue sports.

However, he sees his funda-
mental role as implementing the
policies determined by the
Trustees. ‘'. . . The. Board of
Trustees sets policy,’”’ he said,
“IT don’t. The students don’t.
The administration doesn’t.
The faculty doesn’t [The U.S.
Senate] has advise and consent
powers. . .We have advise
powers only.”

Seeing the Trustees as the
ultimate authority, Bingham
discounts criticism of the Athle-
tic Department by students and
faculty as out of place. He drew
this analogy: “I have no opinion
whatsoever about the Chemi-

_ stry Department or the Philo-

sophy Department. . . and will
not voice any either.’’ He
emphasized, ‘‘I don't want to
create any more divisiveness."’

What Bingham does want to
do is ‘‘serve the students.
That's the bottom line.’’ He
spoke of two other general goals
he had in mind for his depart-
ment.

‘*Be concerned,"’ he said.
“The concept of Christian love
is concern. I want coaches to
have a loving attitude."'

**Be educated.’ Bingham

‘ said students needed a dose of

the real world to complete their
educations. He paraphrased
Trustee Larry Dagenhart and
said, ‘There's lots and lots of
