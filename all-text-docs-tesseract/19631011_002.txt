Apathy? (No)

We cannot help thinking we've
gotten a new slant lately on the vaunt-
ed “student body apathy” which is

appointed ourselves at times in the
lack of student participation in various
extra-curricular events and activities,
we feel that this week in particular
gave evidence that students here will
support worthwhile programs.

Face it. many of the speakers
that come here range from mediocre
to solid bad. There are occasionally,
however, men who make a special ef-
fort to gear their speeches to a male
student body.

Such a man was Sergio Rojas. the
former Cuban ambassador to Great
Britain who spoke in chapel Thursday.
Most of the members of one fraternity
had broken precedence and stayed
around after supper Wednesday night
for about two hours asking Mr. Rojas
questions and listening to him recount
some of his fascinating experiences.
Thursday morning he received a
soundly appreciative applause after

good film presenting the views of
three outstanding American Negro
leaders of the current civil rights
movement. Not only that, but the com-
mittee invited a very articulate speak-
er out from Charlotte for a question-
ing period after the film.

We weren't too surprised that an
overflow crowd jammed the Union
ballroom to see a free flick, but when
the film was over, the mass exodus
we were halfway looking for just did
not materialize.

_ Students stayed, students asked
‘all kinds of questions, and when Dr.
Polley officially ended the question-
ing period, so many people crowded
around DA. Hawkins that everyone
was finally asked to sit down again so
the questioning could continue. And
continue it did, until 1:30 a.m. That’s
“apathy?”

Reviewing The ‘Review’

Three articles on this page and a
news story on the front page concern
themselves with the results of a poll
recently printed in the National Re-
view.

While we aren't about to discount
the entire. poll. that seven per cent
of the student body at Davidson is a
representative proportion strikes us
as a rather dubious assumption.

For example, the preface to the
poll states that “ ... if a college ex-
ceeded its quota (seven per cent re-
turn) at any time, the excess responses
were scientifically eliminated. At
some colleges, the interest in the poll
was so great that as: many as two-
thirds of the responses had to be
thrown out...”

How one goes about “scientifical-
ly” discarding something is not read-
ily apparent.

owever, some statements, such
as, “despite its Presbyterian affilia-
tion, then, Davidson scarcely appears
to be conducive to retention of relig-
ious faith” strikes an alarmingly

What About Us?

For two or three years now we
have had to sit through the Student
Council assembly on NSA and listen
to the latest delegate to the NSA con-
vention run through an elaborate de-
fense of Davidson's membership in
that organization.

The main line of argument used
by the Council runs like this: David-
son is a basically eonservative school
that needs more contact with other
(liberal) points of view; the NSA is a
basically liberal organization; there-
fore, our membership in NSA is war-
ranted because of the many benefits
to be gained from this contact with
ideas not too prevalent in this area.

familiar note.

Many students and occasionally
faculty members have been saying
just that for many years, often in this
newspaper.

Numerous other exceptions could
be taken to the percentages recorded
in the National Review, and particular-
ly to the Review interpretation of the
results.

But the poll itself could be ex-
tremely informative if it were to be
administered to:some 60 per cent of
the Davidson student body, and if the
results were to be interpreted as ob-
jectively as possible by a team of pro-
fessors.

And if not that poll, then why not
one drawn up by the professors them-
selves? We ‘understand one professor
has already done some work in this
direction, and we definitely feel that
such a poll would be beneficial as no
one really has much of an idea what
anybody else areund here thinks any-
way.

Fine, we applaud this argument.

But isn’t something missing?
Like, for stance, the new ideas? Did
the chapel speaker last Tuesday read
any of the recommendations made b
the NSA? Has the Student Council
ever tried to qutline some NSA stands
on issues to the student body either in
chapel or in forums? What we're try-
ing to say is that Tuesday chapel could
have been pit to much better use.

We are glad that this year’s NSA
delegate from Davidson had a_ nice
time at the NSA convention, and that
he was confronted with lots of nice
new ideas. But what about us?

The Unheralded Trumpet

One last observation we want to
mention, and it could only come under
the heading of Things It’s a Crying
Shame Nobody Knows About.

Last Monday afternoon we stum-
bled onto one of the finest individual
performances we've heard in our four
years here. Dr. Grier Williams played
a trumpet concert in the College
Church that kept us literally spell.

bound for over an hour.

The performance was flawlessly
professional, and our only regret was
that more people could not have en-
joyed it. We understand the concert
was one of a monthly series to occur
on Monday afternoons, and that it will
feature outstanding student and facul-
ty musicians. An extremely worth-
while program.

of their disbelief. This is how the Charlotte Observer interpreted the statistics.

But before we eliminate the Bible Department, sever our church affiliation, and
become a secular institution in order to protect our religious faith, let us examine the
accuracy of these conclusions.

I do not propose to challenge
the statistics reported by the
survey, althought I am. still
looking for those Davidson stud-
ents concentrating on nursing.
Let us. however, throw caution
to the wind and assume the sta-
tistics are accurate. What do
they tell us about the students’
religious beliefs?

Of the sample, 82% have
reacted partially or wholly
against their religious tradi-
tion. Of this 82%, 56% react-
ed while in college. Of this
$6%, 78% (or 18 students who
were polled) reported that the
change occurred because of
courses dealing with religion.

When asked, however, if they
wholly reject the religious tra-
dition in which they were raised.
only 14% (or seven students in
the sample) answered in the af-
firmative, while 54% said they
partially agree with the religious
tradition in which they were
raised but have important reser-
vations.

Is it fair to refer to “import-
ant reservations: as an ‘‘anti-
religious reaction”? If the stud-
ent body is “anti-religious,” it is
strange that 52% taking the poll

objected to marrying an atheist
or agnostic.

Is it not more likely that the
student has been called to (hink
critically about his faith and is
searching for more mature an-
swers to religious questions?

The only way to remain
“religious” in the terms of the
survey is to cease growing
intellectually and spiritually.
Any reaction against tradition-
al beliefs, regardless of what
they are, is regarded as “anti-
religious.”

One might also object to the
wording of some of the theologi-
cal questions included in the
poll.

The students were asked if
they believed in immortality of
the soul, 62% aecepted this be-
lief, while 22‘. rejected it. Cer-
tain. students undoubtedly re-
jected the belief because they
have no concept of life beyond
the grave. But other students,
some of whom discussed the
question with me last year, told
me they answerea in the nega-
tive’ because they believed in
resurrectiv: of the body rather
than immortality of the soul.
Does the 22% represent a liber-

Biased NR Threatens
Academic Freedom

BY E. F. PATTERSON
Associate Prof. of Economics
On the basis of past exper-
ience in analyzing data secured
in the manner used by the Edvu-
cational Reviewer it is possible

‘to predict that one could make a

rather thorough-going refuta-
tion of most of the genera! con-
clusions which were drawn from
the data, but the intellectual
benefit end the scientific worth
likely to be derived would hard-
ly merit the time and effort re-
quired.

Hf one is interested in making
this analysis for counter-propa-
ganda purposes (propaganda be-
ing the major purpose of the
article), and this is the only
ground on which expending the
time and effort could be justi-
fied—this purpose is worthy of
consideration, though —, he
would he advised first to read
Darrel Huff's Hew To Lie With
Statistics, and second, to keep
constantly in mind Disracii’'s
apothegm: ‘There are three
kinds of lies; lies, dam lies, and
statistics.”

Since this study obviously is
not motivated by oan interest in
pure science and is not a very
significant contribution to the
body of scientific thotight, one
wonders just what lies behind
it.

Perhaps a clue can be secured
fram the following definition of
statistics: ‘The art of drawing
a crooked line from an unproved
assumption to a foregone con-
clusion.”

It would seem that the con-
clusion that college faculties
exert a “liberalizing” influence,
and therefore students become
relatively more liberal while in
college, was guaranteed before-
hand by the schools selected for
the study.

Faculties, especially those in
the social sciences and humani-

lous professors and conserva-
tism is presently rampant on
the campuses.

(When Kirk was on the David-
son campus last year, he used
the large attendance at his
chapel talk as proof of the wide-
spread acceptance of conserva-
tism, which is about par for the
non sequitur course usually
played by Kirk, Buckley, ef. al.)

Why would they want to dig
up data which apparently re-
futes their earlier conclusion,
which, one presumes, was based
on a thorough and objective
study of the situation?

One answer is that Kirk, et. al.
are perfectly aware that alumni
and Boards of Trustees are con-
siderably more conservative
than their sons and daughters in
college. (This gives rise to the
old-grad cliche-——“if my son isn’t
a socialist at 18, he is a dam
fool; if he isn’t a Repithlican at
24, he is a dam fool—” which
is supposed to reflect what hap-
pened to the old-grad. And it
does, except the old-grad wasn't
a socialist at 18.

Kirk also knows that alumni
and state legislators and Boards
of Trustees are able to bring
and have brought pressure on
college adniinistrators to per-
suade them to discourage the
“liberal” tendencies on college
campuses. A perusal of the
American Association of Uni-
versity Professors Bulletin will
reveal accounts of a substantial
number of actual cases, and it is
well known that only the most
flagrant examples get into the
Bulletin.

It is certain that such pres-
sures, which undoubtedly exist
in the colleges included in the
study, will be increased as a
result of the National Review
article.

One hopes that the respective
college administrations wil! con-
tinue to resist, even more

strongly and successfully, these

al or a conservative portion of
the student body?

The other question which dis-
turbed me dealt with the resur-
rection of Jesus.

This question implies that to
bélieve Christ was raised from
the dead one must believe “a
camera placed outside the tomb”
could have taken a picture of
the Risen Lord.

The question’ ignores com-
pletely the place of faith in re-
ligious belief. Does one, have to
be naive in order to be relig:
ious? Reed College students are
to be commended for not an-
swering this question.

The survey concludes _ that
only 20% of the Davidson stud-
ents believe in the resurrection.
The Charlotte Observer passed
fhe information along without
interpretation. I should hope the
students’ response reveal a de-
gree of theological devclopment
ignored by those who made out
the poll.

Frankly, I have serious doubts
about the statistics found in the
poll. But even if they are cor-
rect, I do not believe the results
on the religious questions have
been interpreted correctly, I
doubt seriously that they give
us an accurate picture of relig-
ious faith on the Davidson cam-
pus.

through an article in the Nation-
al Review. The National Review
included Davidson in a poll con-
ducted among colleges such as
Sarah Lawrence, Stanford, How-
ard, and Reed, to determine the
political and religious attitudes
of American college students.

The overall conclusion was
that most students (excepting
those in Catholic schools) be-
come more liberal in their poli-
tical and religious views while
in college.

Davidson was ranked as poli-
tically, conservative compared to
most of the other schools. The
other and most interesting part
of the poll for Davidsonians con-
cerned the change in traditional.
religious beliefs.

Eighty-two per cent of the
students polled at Davidson have
reacted against their traditional
beliefs.

This change occurred during
their first two years of college
and was due to “courses dealing
with religion” and “increased
thinking about religion and re-
ligious problems.”

The reaction of Russell Kirk
and his associates who conduct-
ed the poll, was that “Despite its
Presbyterian affiliation, then,
Davidson scarcely appears to be
conducive to retention of relig-
ious faith.”

They further lamented that at
“a Christian-affiliated school
located squarely in Christian-
oriented North Carolina less
than twenty-one per cent of the

Dear Editor:

Your invitation to “keep in
close contact with life at David-
son—by reading THE DAVID-
SONIAN" is declined with
thanks.

If you brilliant young men
who call yourselves “editors”
could see yourselves as others
see you, you would not have the
nerve to ask parents or alumni
to pay to read such garbage.

As a parent of a very fine
young man attending Davidson,
T refuse to believe that the news
(?) articles or editorials correct-
ly portray the true story of life
at Davidson.or any college.

In your immature bleating to
get attention from the school

only that which is crude, vulgar,
biased, childish, rude and point-
leas.

So, if you must, stick to your
lust, your campaign for liquor,
your “Goodykoontz,” your de-
fiance for authority, your dis-
respect for character and know-
ledge, your prattle of an idiot—

other cries that religion is dying
at Davidson; that our professors
are leading us from the flock.
Our answer to these cries {s that
they are partly right.

The spoon-fed, unquestioning
attitudes of fundamentalism are
dying and will continue to die
here as long as the freedom to
question remains on our campus.
No intelligent being can accept
a god who is strapped into man-
made concepts such as the trini-
ty, bodily resurrection, and pre:
destination. This is a god who
has been made into an idol by
labels man has pasted on him.

We at Davidson are certainly
not the first to question the
basic of our traditional beliefs.
When Nietzsche declared one
hundred years ago that “God is
dead,” he meant this idolatrous
god which our society has creat-
ed—the god of the creeds which
we mumble each Sunday.

That. this idolatrous god and
his religion are being destroyed
at Davidson is a sign of health
within our community.

Thus, in contrast to the de.
pressing comments of Mr. Kirk
about our school, I feel his poll
reflects the strength of our re-
ligious education, not its weak-
ness.

Christianity entered the world
as a rebellion against traditional
beliefs and can only continue to
be relevant as long as it refuses
to accept the stifling dogma
man imposes on religion.
