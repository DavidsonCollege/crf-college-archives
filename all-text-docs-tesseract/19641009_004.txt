Test P. C. Tomorrow

The Wildcats of Davidson put their 1-1 record on the line this weekend as
they journey to Clinton, South Carolina to face the Blue Hose of Presbyterian

College.

PC has won two of their first

’ three outings, thrashing Fred-
erick 47-17 in their opener and
coming back to snatch one from
Lenoir Rhyne 21-10 the next

week. Last Saturday, however,
Presbyterian fared no better
than the Davidson  gridders,
emerging a 22-9 loser in a battle
with Wofford.

Hot Night, Cold Play
Cause Gridders’ Fall

A hot sticky night and an offense that could not get
started led to Davidson’s downfall, as the Wildcats were
defeated 28-0 by the Citadel last Saturday. __

Playing in Charleston in conditions which caused
tackle Bruce Dalton and end Phil Hightower to suffer
heat exhaustion, the ’Cats fumbled on their own 22 dur-
ing the second minutes of play, and the Citadel scored
two plays later. as Cadet halfback Jim Parker carried or
the first of his two touchdowns. ;

Another touchdown in the second quarter on a nincts
yard drive gave the Citadel a 14-0 lead at halftime.

After a scoreless third quarter, the Cadets scored
twice in the last period on an eight yard run by Parker
and a ten yard pass to halfback Francis Grant.

Coach Bill Dole was not disappointed with the Wild
cats, but commented, “The Citadel was just too tough
for us. They played three units to our two, and the in-
ability to generate a consistent offense forced our defen.
sive team to have to play most of the game. By the fourth
quarter, the unfamiliar humidity wore them down, ano
so the Citadael pushed over those last two touchdowns.

Asked about individual standouts, Coach Dole re.
plied, “Coaches Shoe and Thrift and I talked about this
and we don’t believe anyone played a really good game

PC is a well-balanced squad,
with 21 lettermen from last
year. If the Blue Hose runs
true to form, it will present the
‘Cats a well combined multiple
offense. Running from a Wing-

tack,

The arm of Leighton Grant-
ham, Presbyterian’s fine field
Beneral, has been a deadly
weapon in PC's previous out-
ings. However, he is a doubt-
ful starter Saturday, because of
a broken finger. Jim Bankhead,
Grantham's favorite. target for
the long bomb, is described as
“a good end, big and. fast, with
good downfield moves.’

Having scouted the Blue Hose
once this year, Coach Tom
Stevens ‘reports that PC. al,
though not especially big, seems

to be strong overall; displaying

exceptional speed and hustle.
“They're sharp.’ Stevens re-
marked. ‘Presbyterian always
gives us a good game."

“PC considers us number
one,’ added Coach Bill Dole.
*", hey would rather beat us than
anybody. It’s gonna be a real
tough game.”

The Davidson - Presbyterian
series was initiated in 1919. In
1926 the rivalry was so intense
that a riot occurred following
the game. As a result, the ser-
jes was discontinued, and the
two teams did not meet again
until 1946.

the Wildkattens in their. .season
Opener and ended up with a
fourth quarter win last Satur-
day night at Banner Elk.

Lees-McRae began the scor-
ing with a six-yard pass to end
Gary Vic. After the extra point
attempt failed, the Kittens took
the ball and marched down the
field. Billy Taylor, 180 lb. half-
back - quarterback, tallied with
a two-yard plunge and Pete
Glidewell booted the PAT. The
Junior College Boys added an-
other touchdown pass and an
extra-point to make the half-
time score 13-7,

Davidson came back strong

in the third quarter and Taylor
scored again on a 3-yard run
after another ground-gaining
series. Glidewell again added
the PAT and the Kittens went
into a disastrous fourth quar-
ter with a one-point margin.

minutes of the game, Lees-Me-

and added the PAT to end the
game 26-14,

- Coach Tom Stevens, in com-
menting on the game, said that
the boys played good ball un-
til the last few minute. “Then
the boys began to tire out and
we didn’t have enough subs to
rest anybody. Also unnecessary
penalties hurt our field posi-
tion,’’ Coach Stevens singled out
Billy Taylor as doing ‘‘a fine job
of running” and also comment-
ed on the fine work of guard
George Solley, the defensive
play of Johnny Giles, and the
effective job done by quarter-
back Chip Scharfswerdt.

The Wildkittens meet Har-
grave Military Academy here
Saturday in what should be a
tough game. “Although Har-
grave is a prep school, they
have a big team with several
outstanding boys from this area
and will bring about 40 players
with them,"’ Coach Stevens said.
In commenting on the strategy
for this next encounter Coach
Stevens said he will try to play
more boys this week in order
to give the regulars a little more
rest.

The freshmen did not fare so
well, however, losing to the

turned the course in the best
time for the first year squad

Coach Whittle rated the Wake

this loss the Kittens will im-

the militia.
