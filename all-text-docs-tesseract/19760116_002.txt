Voting invalidated,
new polls called

By BRAD SWALWELL

During this week’s Senate
meeting, SGA President Bo
Baskin invalidated two of last
Tuesday's three senatorial
elections on the grounds that
SGA election regulations had
not been followed.

Baskin ruled that juniors
Bob Palmer and Tony Snow
and sophomore Steve Sparger
had been illegally barred from
their respective Class Senator
elections. There will be new
elections next Tuesday.
January 20, for the classes of
1977 and 1978.

Baskin said that he acted
under the authority of a clause
in the SGA by-laws which
directs the SGA President to
“oversee the execution of all
policies of the SGA.”’

“These policies were not
carried out since three people
were selectively barred from
the ballot. Five people
technically missed the manda-
but only these three were not
allowed to run.

“Consequently , there will be
new elections for the Class of
‘77 and Class of ‘78. All the
people who originally filed for
these two races. including
Palmer, Snow, and Sparger,

will be on the ballot.”” said
Baskin.

Baskin responded to a
question as to why the race for
Class of 1979 Senator was not
included in his ruling.

“The Class of "79 is not
affected by my ruling since no
one was barred from that
particular election. My ruling
is that all candidates who filed
for office will be allowed to
run.

“All the people who filed for
the Class of '79 race were on
last Tuesday's ballot. The

Senatecalls new elections,
unprecendented move

By LYMAN COLLINS
Assistant News Editor

Tuesday night, in an un-
precedented action, SGA
President Bo Baskin invali-
dated the results of the sopho-
more and junior class elections
and called for new elections on
Tuesday, January 20.

“The elections were invali-
dated because all the candi-
dates did not get equal protec-
tion under the SGA By-laws.”
explained Baskin.

The problem goes back to a
rule in the By-laws that states
all candidates must attend an
six hours of the filing deadline.

and candidates Dean Eklund,
Bob Palmer, Howard Payne.
Tony Snow, and Steve Spar-
ger were missing. Minutes
after conclusion of the
meeting, Eklund and Payne
arrived at the meeting.

“We've always tried to keep

them in on the meeting and
placed their names on the

A few hours later, Junior
Tony Snow also asked Baskin
to place his name on the
ballot, however, Baskin felt
that he couldn’t.

Baskin urged Snow to take
the matter up with Elections
Chairman George Reedy, who
ruled that if Snow, as well as
the other two candidates who
failed to attend the meeting,
could get a petition with all
the other candidates’ signa-
tures, he would place their
names on the ballot.

Meanwhile, some people be-
gan to question the officiality
of the All Candidates meeting
since Chairman Reedy was
absent. SGA By-laws state
that the candidates shall meet
with the SGA President and
the Chairman of the Election
Board.

“I think the meeting was
official even though I wasn’t
there,’’ commented Reedy.
“After all the meeting is for
the candidates, not the chair-
man.

Elections were held Tuesday
with Eklund and Payne on the
ballot, but Palmer, Snow and

Sparger were missing.

‘Lhe issue came to a head
Tuesday when SGA Parlimen-
tarian Peyton Marshall re-
gistered a complaint con-
cerning the elections to Bas-
kin. In addition several sena-
tors boycotted the meeting
until Baskin invalidated the
results. -

soring these events at many
colleges and universities. We
hope a lot of Davidson stu-
dents participate and make
our tournament a success.
Then the entire program will
get off to a good start and
other schools will sponsor
competition,”’ said Russ.
Duplicate bridge will be
played on nine selected Friday
nights through May. To be
eligible for the $200 top prize,

“I'm afraid we got caught
between a rock and a hard
place,’’ said Baskin. ‘We real-
ly didn’t mean to get so tied
up in By-law legality.”

After his action, Baskin
referred the issue back to
Reedy who decided to allow all
five of the candidates who filed
but missed the meeting to be
placed on the ballot.

“It just wasn’t fair to allow
some candidates to miss the
meeting and still be on the
ballot while others were ex-
cluded for the same reason.
We felt that the new elections
were the only way to be
completely fair and treat all
the candidates equally,”’
added Baskin.

He further said that she
regretted having to put the
sophomore and junior candi-
dates through the election
treadmill once more.

Freshman election resul
were not affected by the
ruling. “lel

‘I apologize for the mis-
takes I made and wish I
hadn’t made them. But now -
we have to look to the future. I
don’t think there’ will be any~
long range effects from this, .
but I do think we will have to
review the By-laws and there
may be some changes made,”’ -
concluded Baskin.

Stetin.

“Thus, 15 months have now
elapsed since the NIOSH
findings and 11 months have
gone by since-the Union's
petition was filed, and still no
action has been taken,”” said
Stetin.

“Our research has indicated
that textile companies have
used the five years of delay by

the U.S. Department of Labor
as an excuse for taking no
significant action on their own
to cut down the dangers of
cotton dust exposure,”’ con-
tinued Stetin,

problem is firm, immediate
