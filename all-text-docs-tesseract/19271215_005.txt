Mountaineers Aided By
Sale of Old Clothing

Help Educational Activities at
Crossnore

Money obtained from the sale of the
old clothes collected yesterday will be
turned into school buildings and educa-
tion for the mountain people of the state.
The Y. M. G. A. sponsors every year:a
collection of cast-off clothing to send to
Crossnore, a town -near Blowing Rock,

N.C.

Early in 1913 Mrs. Mary Martin Sloop,
sister to Dr. W. J. Martin, began a system
of collecting old garments in various
cities and selling these at cheap prices to
the mountain people. Her work has re-
sulted in the establishment of a school, |

|

two churches, a post office, electric lights, |
a community club, securing of a trained
nurse, good roads, and a co-operative
factory at Crossiore. Through |
her efforts, the population in the com-|
munity has increased from 23 in 10913, to|
well over a thousand,

The old clothes plan originated, when |
Mrs. Sloop received some clothes from |

Seniors Appointed
_ to Decide on Gift

The student body awaits the announce-
ment of the Senior class gift with a great
deal of interest as the presentation of a
gift from the out-going class as a whole
‘to its Alma Mater has become a custom
of general acceptance among all schools
and colleges. Davidson classes of yore
have upheld their standards very well
indeed, as is evidenced by campus seats,
ticket booth, and other useful things, and
it is expected that the present group of
seniors will present a gift thoroughly
measuring up to those of previous times.

A committee composed of Bob Platt,
Boyce Martin, J. S McAllister, and Bob
Link has been appointed to consider a
suitable gift and this.committee will meet
in the near future, probably this week,
under the leadership of Bob Platt, its
chairman, to formulate a report for the

hard for its initial game with the Salisbury

strong one, and it will take good and fast

For Frats at Duke

the Pan-Hellenic council, all fraternities
at Duke will have Monday night as the
time for regular meetings, and all other

flicts which many of the fraternity meet-
ings caused with other meetings. Under
the plan as adopted there will be no con-
flicts in either social or honorary fra-
ternity meetings. The fraternities which
come under this regulation are: Phi Del-
