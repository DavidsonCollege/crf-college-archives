Security

Vandals defend threat '
they give to security

By CHUCK KENNON
Managing Editor :

He was particularly proud of one
Spring Frolics night, several years
ago, when he relocated a lot of the
identification signs in front of campus
buildings.

A random sampling of upperclass
males showed that a moderate num-
ber of students occasionally indulge in
defacing school property. Despite the
efforts of the administration to stifle
our young minds by painting over the
bathroom stall doors, self-expression
continues.

Said one student in the library, “It
doesn’t take a lot of intelligence to
notice that pencils will write on the
black paint.”

Other spontaneous arts of madness
noted by students included the demo-
lition of a desk chair in a hall in Belk,
the burning of posters on hall walls,
and the breaking of hall light bulbs in
indoor Frisbee tournaments.

The guilty parties uniformly de-
clared that there was no malicious-
ness involved. ‘‘New ways of letting
off steam are hard to find, so we
revert to stupid things like water
balloons. :

“But watch out, because some of us
are planning on really cutting loose
this spring,”’ a senior warned. ‘‘We’ve

been experimenting to see just what’

the solubility of sugar in gasoline is,
and almost no one that works in
Chambers has a lock cap.”
Vandalism by students currently
seems to be at a low ebb, with most
obvious damage stemming from acts

Several freshmen, bemoaning the
loss of bicycles left in front-of the
Union, brilliantly came upon a solu-
tion: let the Davidson Police Force
plant a bike outside and try to capture
the scurvy culpret. Yet, this was once
attempted, as the story opens but the
police force was foiled and the bike
was stolen, to their chagrin, from
right under Davidson Security noses.

Such tales unfortunately seem to
illustrate the general opinions held by
Davidson students who have had any
contact with the local police force.
The most common description. is
“incompetent’’ but there is also an
apathy that exists where on-campus
students now hesitate in even report-

designed to alleviate the tedium.
Several students, who have been
known to inflict damage on property
about campus, discussed their views
on vandalism at Davidson.

One, a junior, said that he broke or
otherwise rearranged things when he
felt particularly frustrated. ‘‘I try not
to destroy anything that another
person would really like or want
around.

“‘Like, when I’m really mad at
something and I want to vent my
hostilities or something I might look
around for something to do. We want
to be sort of secret about what we do,
and we don’t want to really upset
something.”

But he didn’t seem too concerned
about only slightly inconveniencing
people. “Little humorous things like
pulling up a ‘Reserved”’ parking sign
or mixing up signs showing directions
about campus are fun to do. If I
suffer, I want the satisfaction of at
least making some other joker to go
out of his way some, too,’’ he
explained with a spreading leer.

A senior admitted that while he was
out of the vandalism business now,
‘‘more or less,”’ in his younger days he
had one favorite method of displaying
his attitude toward things in general.

“I'd always go through the first
floor of Chambers late at night, and
pull down the posters off the wall. I
was in an especially creative mood at
times and turned some of them
around or pin them up in patterns.”’
He then proudly recounted several
specific examples of his former guer-
rilla raids.

Sentelle dorm senator Hans
Watford is coordinating the
:Senate’s efforts to investigate ;
‘and alleviate the security pro-
blem at Davidson. In an inter- -
view immediately following last
Monday’s senate meeting, Hans
spoke candidly abcut his plans
and goals.

“We're trying to evaluate
campus security on several dif-
ferent levels. For example, we
want to see how easy it is to get
into buildings as well as check
out the existing security forces.

Right not we’re looking for
people from different sections of
the campus— people with a defi-
nite burning interest—to serve
on our security council. I don’t
like the word committee because
it sounds like we’ll be vigilantes
snooping around. We’re not
trying to take the place of the
police.”

Watford stressed the necessi-
ty and value of close cooperation

security force

Precinct #2 was founded in
1973, the year following the
enrollment of the first girls’
class at Davidson. The college
felt a need at that time to
establish a police headquarters
on campus, for they believed
the original station was too far
away to amply protect the
girls.

The campus precinct is an
extension of the Davidson
Police Department, with fifty
percent of the department’s
operations having been moved
to that location. At the time of
the opening of Precinct #2, the
department also increased its
force from four men to 13. The
number has since dropped to
12:

Before the expansion of the
police force, the Davidson

campus was protected by a
security police force, which the
college decided was inade-
quate for its needs with fe-
males on campus.

In 1972, the college set up a
contract with the town calling
for two regular policemen to
patrol the campus each night.
This proved confusing, so
Precinct #2 was set up in 1973,
with an expanded police force.
The collegéhas been helping
to support the department
since 1972.

Captain Hughes, head of
Precinct #2, responded the
questions about the current
crime rate on campus, ‘“‘We’ve
had, at the most, ten reported
larcenies in the last six mon-
ths. Comparatively speaking
we're way down on the crime
rate this year.”’

Hughes was also asked why

his men were rarely seen
patrolling on foot, as pre-
scribed in the ‘‘Standards
Operations Procedure’, which
outlines the purpose and du-
ties of Precinct #2. The stan-
dards call for the force to walk
80 percent of the time.

He replied, ‘‘Well, they're
there. Like I told a girl the
other night, they’re not out
there to be seen; they’re out
there to see. They try tp stay,

4 lot of times, in the shadows.
There are some dark areas: by
Watts, especially right now
between Carnegie Hall and
Little Dorm.

‘The officers are out on
foot. Right now we’re having
communications problems, be-
cause we only have one walkie-
talkie. When two officers sep-
arate for some reason of
another, they have no way of
talking to one another.”

ing theft with the excuse that ‘they
probably couldn’t do anything about
it anyway.”

Off-campus housing is more frequ-
ently ‘‘hit’’ where campus security is
non-existent. ‘‘The Davidson student
is fostered in trust,”’ says Sally Stow.
“It is beyond reality to think that it
could work off-campus.’’ Though
after installing dead bolts and leaving
lights on, they have had no more
trouble.

“It’s kind of discouraging. I feel as
though I’m going through a lock box
every time I come home.”

Next door, Nicky Guy had similar
experiences as he watched black
children, eleven to thirteen years old,
walk right in while sitting there.
“We have never locked our house and

always felt confident. [t’s disappoin-
ting when we go to the police and
have heard nothing since. We wish
they had followed up.”

The standard procedure for thefts is
to file a report with the police
immediately after discovery. Bob
Grizzard echoed the consensus of
most when he said that the police
were ‘‘officially optimistic, but unoffi-
cially expressed little hope of recov-

ery.’

The police will come by and check
off-campus houses during break upon
request, yet student response to this
ranges from satisfaction in the “‘coop-
eration’’ by security to the cries of
‘‘incompentency”’ and disappoint-
ment in having called the police
several times when ‘‘they haven’t
even known we had called. soon

before.”

On campus, in response to the
recent Carnegie break-in, the result
on the part of the police and of Will
Terry and Mary Lou Dietler has been
impressive. ‘‘I had to go out and
identify two people coming to see me
who had forgotten their ID’s,‘‘ says
Kathleen Golding. ‘Sometimes the
police aren’t always on the ball, but
Will and Mary Lou are doing all they
can,”

Yet, all in all, many feel a basic lack
of confidence in the campus security.
“Last year Mr. Sherrill (the late
campus watchman) was ‘always ar-
ound,” says Joe Craig. ‘‘Now they're

not even visible. If you’re robbed, you men

call them, they write up a report, and ETCETERA Suffers fear theft.

you never hear again. Now, people
don’t even bother to call it in.”
