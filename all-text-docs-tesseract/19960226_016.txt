QUINN-tessential }

- Davidson dominates Southern

By Micuakt Kruse
Assistant Sports Editor

Chris Alpert secured a
starting job and a position
on the All-Southern Confer-
ence freshman squad three
years ago. Classmate Bran-
don Williams garnered all-
conference honors as a
sophomore.

Fellow senior Quinn
Harwood’s statistical impact

as a Davidson Wildcat was

not so instantaneous, aver-
aging 1.1 points in just 14
games as a rookie, and 7.9
points and 4.8 rebounds in
his second collegiate cam-
paign.

But the 6-9, 240-pound
point forward vaulted to the
forefront last winter, ac-
counting for 13.3 points and
7.1 boards an outing.

And he has continued
to play a vital role in this
year’s magical season, aver-
aging 14.7 points (second

on the team behind scoring
machine Williams) and 5.8
rebounds. He also leads the
team in field goal percent-

age (56% overall, 63% in
league play).

“We certainly wouldn’t
be where we are right now if
it wasn’t for Quinn,” said
Alpert, “He’s having a sen-
sational senior year. You
can’t say much about his
hardwork and his dedication
because you just look at his
statistics and they’re all
there.”

Against Michigan on
Dec. 30, Harwood matched
up against some of the
nation’s premiere post play-
ers and recorded perhaps the
game of his life, notching a
then career high 22 points
and 11 rebounds.

“Tt (the Michigan game)
was fun, but dissapointing
because I thought we
could’ve won,” said

Harwood, “I thought, deep —

down, we were the better
team. Something tells me
that I wouldn’t mind facing

them again.”
Two weeks later,
Harwood shattered that per-

sonal best, amassing 31
points against Furman. He

has done this by being the
most versatile player on the
Southern Conference’s most
versatile team. ‘

“You look at anybody
in college basketball. and
there are not going to be too
many guys whoare 6-9, 240,
who can dribble, shoot, pass,
rebound, and play defense,”
Williams said, “When you
can get a player who can
play three positions, four
positions, that’s extraordi-
nary.”

Added freshman
bigman Chadd Holmes, “Of
all the guys on the team, the
things he does impress me
the most. Every game, he
does something that im-
presses me more and more.”

But Harwood’s versa-
tility is not limited to the
hardcourt. In an era when
the academic status and
graduation rate among col-
lege athletes has dipped
appallingly low and the title
“student-athlete” has be-
come somewhat of an oxy-
moron, Harwood defines the
term.

Offered scholarships |

from Virginia Tech and
Richmond, both schools
with significant hoops rec-
ognition, Harwood instead
chose Davidson because of
the balance between aca-
demics and bigtime basket-
ball.

A Reston, Va. native,
Harwood earned honor roll
status three years at South

‘Lake High.

Now a Biology major,
the GTE/CoSida Academic
All-American candidate cur-
rently boasts a 3.6 grade
point average.

Harwood willtry to play
professionally somewhere
after graduation, but if his
future basketball plans fal-
ter, he will enroll in medical
school and work to become
a doctor — quite an assuring
safeguard for Mr. Versatile.

Ferrucci fights injuries, leads Wildcats

By Danie, Motz
Staff Writer

Freshman year, center Kristen Ferrucci
suffered a broken leg. Junior year a broken
nose cut her season short. And this year, a
serious, partially dislocated kneecap suf-
fered in December was supposed to end her
season and career at Davidson, It didn’t.

Ferrucci, a 6-1 senior from Grove City,
Pa. has contributed a lot to the Davidson
Women’s basketball program, despite her
injuries. She has improved her statistics
each season, as she now leads the Wildcats
with close to 13 points per game. Her 64.4
field goal percentage was third in NCAA
last season, and she has topped that this year,

shooting 70 percent from the floor.

“You won’t find a better center in the
conference thatcanrun the court like Kristen.
She gets down for the break faster than a lot
of guards in the league do,” Coach John
Filar said.

Her skills have won the respect of her
teammates.

“She really knows how to play her
position. Her agile moves to the basket are
excellent,” Jessica Montrella said.

Aside from her skills on the court, she
has earned just as muchrespect by the work
she does off the court.

“She has been a leader on this team for
four years. She showeda lot of people what
kind of person she is with the way she

worked herself: back to playing condition
after the knee injury,” Filar said.

“She is the glue of this team. She al-
ways knows what to say and when to say it,”
Carolyn Kirsch said.

After a cambined 18-57 record her first
three seasons. Ferrucci is excited about the
team’s success this year.

“This year has been a great accomplish-
ment. For the first time since I have come to
Davidson the team we really thinks it can
win. It is a great feeling.”

Ferrucci says the Wildcats have the
potential to be in the Southern Conference
tournament championship game, and once
that is achieved, she says anything can hap-
pen.

Ferrucci gets fou led.

_ But for now, Quinn and
the 22-3 Wildcats are fo-
cused on the Southern Con-
ference tournament title and
an NCAA bid.

“My favorite memory’s
gonna be this year when we
put up a banner and go to the
NCAA tournament,” said
Harwood.

Harwood, Williams,
and Alpert, along with vet-
erancompanions Jeff Ander-
sonand Mark McGuire, rep-
resent the most successful
basketball class at Davidson
in twenty-two years.

They have been the keys
to Davidson’s resurgence as
a basketball power.

“They’ve set the tone

for the future of Davidson
basketball,” said Wildcat
mentor Bob McKillop, “And
I think they’re going to be
catalysts for what happens
beyond this year because I
think there’s going to be a
carry over from this year to
the next and the next to the
next. They have built that
foundation.”
_ “They’re inseparable.
Those five guys are some-
thing special to me. Those
are the first five guys that, as
‘a group, came in here and
wanted to make Davidson
something special. They
had a twinkle in their eye
that told that they could.”
