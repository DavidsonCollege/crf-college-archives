Union board rejects cigarette machine, but smokers still have hope

By Jay Jennings

Although the Union board re-
jected the idea of cigarette ma-
chines in the Outpost, the possibil-
ity of cigarette machines on cam-
pus in the near future is encourag-
ing.

The head of the Auxiliary Ser-
vices Committee of the SGA asked
Merrill Earnest, the student head
of the Union Policy Committee, to
take the plan for cigarette machines
to the Union Policy Committee
last week.

The Committee approved the
motion to have cigarette machines
in the Outpost, but the Union board
defeated the motion.

The members of the board feel
that although there is a definite
need for a cigarette machine on
campus, the Outpost is not the best
place for it. There are concerns
that if the machines were in the
Outpost, the Outpost would be-
come smoke infested. Some think

that the ventilation in the Outpost
can not handle a great increase in
the number of smokers.

According to Union board
members, the cigarette machines
would have an adverse effect on
non-smokers because the smoke
could become a problem. The
board realizes the need for the
machines to prevent people from
driving places late at night on a
quest for cigarettes. However,
Steve: Krause, an anti-smoker,
thinks that "itis good to force smok-
ers to go off campus for cigarettes,
so the college is not helping smok-
ers get their cigarettes."

In the upcoming week, Ear-
nest will be thinking about an al-
ternate spot for the machines and
then go about the appropriate steps
to get the machines. Some suggest
having the machines either in
Chambers or the Union. The prob-
lem of having the machines in the
Unionis thatit closes at one o’clock

Christian Music Controversy at
NMU

MARQUETTE, Mich.
(CPS)—Student funding will con-
tinue to back a Christian rock pro-
gram on North Michigan’s
University’s student station,
WUPX-FM in Marquette, Mich.

The radio show, which is
funded with student activity
money was in conflict with a uni-
versity policy prohibiting student
activity money from being used to
fund religious activities, detrac-
tors said.

The radio station receives
about $9,700 a semester from stu-
dent activity fees and a portion of
this money is used to fund the
Christian rock programming.

Station manager Kale
Seagraves defended the Christian
programming. He said the show
is not a religious activity and does
not promote a specific religion.
He said the station simply plays
music that has won music awards
and is listened to be the students
with varied religious beliefs and
backgrounds.

Seagraves said that the show
is aired on Sunday from 5 p.m. to
8 p.m. because the disc jockey
was available during that time,
and not for religious reasons.

Dean of Students Sandra
Michaels, also defending the pro-
gramming, said the show is not a
religious activity. -

“It’s just allowing them (the
radio station) to play all the rock
music students find popular,”
Michaels said.

Jesuit Colleges Form Alliance

(CPS)—Students who attend
Jesuit campuses have formed an
organization to increase commu-
nication among their colleges and
universities, student leaders in the
organization said.

Jesuit University Students
Concerned with Empowerment
(JUSTICE) was started in 1992 as
a link between the 28 Jesuit cam-
puses nationwide. Its purpose is
to help the students bond spiritu-

ally and allow them to develop
friendships with students in other
Jesuit universities.

Each Jesuit University has
JUSTICE meetings where the
university’s issues can be ad-
dressed. Students talk about their
concerns within the university and
discuss national concerns, such as
multiculturalism. ‘The organiza-
tion also serves as a liaison for
other campus groups that could
benefit from the topics discussed.

The main event of JUSTICE
that brings its members together
is its national convention, which
was held this fall at String Hill
College in Mobile, Ala. About 40
students attended the convention.
In addition to hearing speakers,
the Jesuit students chose a na-
tional issue to support for the up-
coming year. Last year’s issue
was AIDS awareness.

Medical School

Applications Rise

CHICAGO (CPS)--The number
of applications to medical school
continues to rise despite the fact
that many physicians express dis-
satisfaction with practicing medi-
cine, according to an article pub-
lished in the Journal of the Ameri-
can Medical Association.

Between 1989 and 1992 the
number of medical school appli-
cants climbed 39 percent.

The growing number of ap-
plicants is not congruent with the
current survey information that
practicing physicians are dissatis-
fied with medicine and unsure
about the outcome of the health
system reform, officials say.

In addition to an overall ap-
plicant increase, there was alsoan
increase in the number of minori-
ties and women being accepted
into medica school.

There was a 12 percent in-
crease in the number of minorities
accepted to medical school in
1991, and the percentage of
women in the 1992 entering class
increased from 31.6 percent in

1982 to 41.8 percent.

and many smokers want cigarettes
after this time.

Chambers might be the best
suggestion, because people would
always have access to the machine.
Brian Vandersea agrees, because
he feels that "cigarette smoke is

most annoying while he is trying to
eat." The problem with Chambers
in that it is not a central place on
campus, according to Earnest. .
Suggestions are welcome, be-
cause the more ideas will enable
the students to be properly repre-

sented. Kamil Shah thinks that
"everyone is dipping on campus
now, so whatis the big deal." Kevin
Miller "does not care about ciga-
rette machines as long as smokers
stay out of designated non-smok-
ing areas"

Minorities, internationals, and disabled get
help at career services >

By Scott Windham

The addition of three new em-
ployees this semester has allowed
the Office of Career Services to
expand its services aimed directly
at Davidson’s “smaller popula-
tions,” namely minority students,
internationals, and students with
disabilities. These groups are also
encouraged to use the resources
available to all students.

Career Services continues to
offer such resources as the Black
Alumni Network and the Interna-
tional Student Employment Guide.
In addition, students now have ac-
cess to a host of new services.

International students may
profit from the International Stu-
dent Career Network. This net-
work contains files on Davidson
alumni who are involved in inter-
national careers or who were clas-
sified as internationals during their
time at Davidson, and will allow
current international students, as
well as other students interested in
international job opportunities, to
contact alumni for informational
interviews.

Staff members note thatspeak-
ing with someone who “has been
there” will greatly help interna-
tional students with their career or
graduate school plans.

Minority students benefit from
a Career Services newsletter, de-
livered weekly to dorm rooms.
Minorities who do not receive the
newsletter should call Scott
Windham at -2132. The newslet-
ter includes the calendar of events
for the week andhighlights job and
internship opportunities, job-find-
ing books and magazines, and other
items ofinterest aimed specifically
at minorities, including graduate
school and fellowship information.

Graduate schools who visit
campus generally send informa-
tion on minority admission, stu-

dent groups, and special minority
scholarships. Career Services also
publishes a guide to corporations
and institutions interested in at-
tracting minority candidates.
Names and addresses of contact
people are listed in the guide.

Minority studénts who are in-
terested in internships should con-
tact John Eaves for information on
financial support.

Students with disabilities
might be interested to know that
Career Services receives copies of
the Job Training and Placement
Report, a manual containing ca-
reer-related information for dis-
abled people. In addition, the of-
fice receives notices from institu-
tions interested in assisting the dis-
abled in the job-finding process.
Copies of the leaflet Test-Taking
for Students with Disabilities,

which addresses the regulations
regarding graduate school testing
for physically-and learning-dis-
abled students, are available in the
Careers ‘Library: Students: who
think of services not currently of-
fered for the disabled are highly
encouraged tocall Career Services,

Careers Library director Ann
Melton notes that the library con-
tains many resources to assist
Davidson’s smaller populations in
the search for jobs, internships,
and summer employment.

aimed at job-placement for mi-
norities, the library keeps current

McNeil Smith to discuss
reinventing a free Estonia

By Jeff Fuller

The Dean Rusk Program will
present McNeill Smith, a 75 year
old partner in the Greensboro law
firm of Smith Helms Mulliss &
Moore who will speak about his
experiences in Estonia. Smith’s
speech ‘Can Estonia reinvent it-
self?’ will be deliveredon Wednes-
day, November 17 at 7:30 p.m. in
the 900 room.

Smith was educated at the
University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill and the Columbia
University Law School. Soon af-
ter passing the bar examination,
Smith joined the U.S. Navy during
World War II. He later served in
the North Carolina state house for
one term in 1970 and was a state
senator from 1972 to 1978.

He also ran for a seat in the
U.S. Senate in 1978 against Jesse

Helms. Recently Smith travelled
to Estonia to assist the country in
its transition from communism to
democracy in the realm of law.
“There are legal problems never
before faced, much less solved, in
any country,” said Smith.

Working with the American
Bar Association, Smith sought to
assist Estonian lawyers in forming
new laws and helping Estonia en-
ter a free-market economy. Some
problems Smith faced in Estonia
include Estonia’s inexperience
with marketing or finance, no anti-
trust laws, no bankruptcy laws, no
consumer protection laws, and no
border control. However Estonia
does have a stable currency and the
second highest literacy rate in the
world according to Smith.
