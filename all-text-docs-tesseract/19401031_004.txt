BEAT

CENTRE

THE

paeer: Four

With The ’Cats

To anyone reading in the paper that Furman had beaten
Davidson. 40-7, apparently little could be -said in defense of
the Wildcats. To those of us who Were there, there was
much that could be said.

Davidson left the field at the half on the long end of *,|
a 7-6 score. But the players were “shot,” as the saying
goes, wilted by the summer heat. Davidson used scarcely
any subs, Furman used two complete teams. While the
second team played, the first team retired to the locker
room and rested in the cool. Small wonder Furman piled
up 34 points in the second half.

However, let’s let by-gones be by-gones, as the saying'|
goes. Looking to the future, to this corner it seems that
Davidson should win three of their remaining four games.

The spirit of the squad is excellent at the moment and should |
get better after the win over Centre, which we fully expect.
Providing no serious injuries‘are sustained in the Duke
encounter, the Wildcats should come through with wins
over Hampden-Sidney and The Citadel.

Sorry to learn that Granville Sharpe’s gridiron career at |
Davidson has come to a close. Reinjuring the knee that was |
hurt in the State game, Sharpe is detinitely out for the rest of |
the year. w

Midwest Superior?

Recently we had an opportunity of discussing with a fellow
who should knaw a question: which has always interested us,
which section of the country plays the superior brand of foot-
ball. Our friend maintained stoutly the superiority of the bruis-
ing squads of the Midwest.

As a reason for his belief he showed us a naster of the
Minnesota squad of this year. After taking a gander at
some of the statistics, we are more or less inclined to agree
with-him:

The Gopher squad: consists of 57 men, and of
only four are from out of the state. Twenty-four weigh over
200 pounds. The firs averages 222 pounds, the back-
field close to 200. The lightest man on the squad tips the beams
at a mere 174 and is considered a “scat” back

Mere beef does not make a team, we contended. Our
