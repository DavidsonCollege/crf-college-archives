Spencer discusses the revised comprehensive fee plan.

Comprehensive Fee Revised
By Bevan-Cornell Decision

By BILL GIDUZ
Asst. Managing Editor

In a statement issued Tuesday
morning, College President Sam-
uel R. Spencer Jr. announced
that vice presidents John M.
Bevan and C. David Cornell
reviewed the comprehensive fee
and recommended that the
board portion of the fee be re-
vised.

Spencer stated that he ap-
proves of the recommendations
and they will be implemented
Starting with the next school
year.

The revised plan states that
the principle of the fee will re-
main, but its implementation
will be changed so that, ‘‘Up-
perclass students will be given
the option of boarding at. the
center on Patterson Court, at

the fraternity houses on cam-
pus, or they may make individ-
ual arrangements to eat else-
where.”

Mechanics for making the
choice will be as follows: on the
first billing for the year, mailed
on or about Aug. 1, students
and/or parents will have an op-
portunity to check a space in-
dicating ‘‘Do not wish college
board for the year.’’ The charge
for board will be deducted for
all who check and return the
statement by Sept. 1.

All students eating in frater-
nities will handle their arrange-
ments with each fraternity both
for board and for any addition-
al fees.

Freshmen will still be re-
quired to eat at the three ARA
houses: the old Phi Gam house,

Faculty Favors Review Of Calendar

By THOM NICOLL
Asst. Managing Editor

Results of a recent survey cf
the faculty reveal that a signif-
icant number favor a review of
Davidson's present 3-3-3 calen-
dar, according to John M. Be-
van, vice president for academ-
ic affairs.

Of the approximately 100
forms sent out, 53 were return-
ed. Thirty of the forms retutn-
ed were favorable to a review
of the 3-3-3 system. Of the re-
maining group, 20 claimed to
be relatively satisfied with the
present calendar, while three
indicated that they would be
equally happy under any sys-
tem.

Sixteen of those who favored

a review claimed that a_ sys-
tem based on the semester
would be preferable, while 17
exrpessed interest in either a
4-1-4 calendar or, perhaps a
4-0-4 system, under which a stu-
dent would work during the
missing middle month only if he
made special arrangements with
a_ professor.

One common complaint about
the 3-3-3 calendar was that it
limited the extended studies
program. This argument is that
while a professor is teaching
regular courses, he tends to re-
gard extended studies as some-
thing ‘“‘extra” and of low prior-
ity. ;

About 14 per cent of the re-
plies indicated that the 10 week
term does not provide adequate
time for students to grasp the

ideas of a course. Others argued
that 10 weeks were not ade-
quate for students to conduct
certain scientific research ex-
periments.

Several who approved the pro-
posed review claimed that Da-
vidson’s calendar should be
more compatible with those of
the schools who share co-opera-
tive programs with Davidson.

Of those who opposed a re-
view of the calendar, 10 simply
felt that the 3-3-3 was adequate
and eight Stated that the calen-
dar has not been tried long
enough to make a judgment.

Others claimed that the 10
week term was ideal for cer-
tain programs, such as the
Spring Term in Classics Abroad.

Even of those who favored no

review of the basic structure of
the calendar, several wished to
review the timing of the winter
break. Of the 53 replies, 12 in-
dicated dissatisfaction with the
present timing of the Christmas
vacation.

Bevan said he will take the
results of this survey to the Ed-
ucational Policy Committee
which will investigate the pres-
ent calendar as well as alterna-
tives. They will then report to
the faculty.

Student Body President Ralph
Peeples said he welcomes dis-
cussion on the calendar issue.
“I think it is important that we
evaluate present practices from
time to time in order to deter-
mine whether they are most
beneficial to the college,” he
said.

the old SPE house, and another
house to be decided on soon.

The revised fee allows for re-
funds in cases where a student
leaves the campus for one term
or more to pursue academic
work.

Off campus housing and spec-
ial requests to be excluded
from any specific portion of
the fee will be individually con-
sidered by Dean of Students
Will Terry, the statement -said.

The compulsive board section
of the fee had been under at-
tack by students since its con-
ception, but reactions to the
alteration of board payment
were favorable.

Former Student Body Presi-
dent Danny Clodfelter, who ini-
tiated the battle against the
fee, commented, ‘‘It shows what
can be done if you keep up the
pressure and are really inter-
ested in getting something done.
It's a victory for the students
in that they (the administration)
were forced to go back and re-
consider and change a decision
that they had already made.
That's the important point."

Ralph Peeples, present Stu-
dent Body President praised the
administration for the move. ‘‘It
shows a willingness on the part
of the administration to listen
to the students on matters about
which they are truly concerned,”
he said. “It is a compromise
and a good one. It's the best
indication that I've had since
I've been at Davidson that pro-
gress can be made without con-
frontation."’

Students must decide whether
to join the ARA plan by Sept. 1,
as no meal tickets will be is-
sued after that date. However,
ARA houses will serve food to
any student on a cash basis at
any time.

YMCA Attempts To Meet Challenges

AN ANALYSIS

By DOUG BROWN
Managing Editor

The Young Men's Christian Associa-
tion (YMCA), an organization which
has always seemed an integral part of
Davidson, is in a period of transition.

With the departure of College Chap-
lain R. Scott Woodmansee in Decem-
ber, the YMCA is presently without an
advisor, and it has had to rely on the
initiative of its student leadership.

Another factor which will have a
considerable influence on the future of
the- YMCA is its planned relocation off
campus this coming fall.

The only contact most students have
with the YMCA is through its annual
fund drive when they are asked to do-
nate money. Seemingly, most are una-
ware of what the YMCA is or what it
does.

YMCA programs now invoive such
varied fieids as the tutoring of under-
privileged children, scouting, hall dis-
cussions, symposiums on great issues,
draft counseling and other activities.

However most of these programs go
unnoticed, and as one member of the
YMCA Cabinet put it at a recent meet-
ing, ‘I didn’t even know what the YM-
CA was or did until I became a mem-
ber of the Cabinet.”

Of immediate concern to the members
of the YMCA Cabinet, the governing
body of the YMCA, is the problem of
getting a new college chaplain. Wood-
mansee, before leaving Davidson, left
three recommmendations about the fu-
ture of the chaplaincy at Davidson.

One of the recommendations Wood-
mansee made was that the chaplain
could serve as college chaplain and as
associate minister at the Davidson Col-
lege Presbyterian Church. Another pro-
posal was that the chaplain could he-
come a member of the faculty, in addi-
tion to his other duties. The fina! recom-
mendation was that the position of chan-
lain remain essentially as it is now.

Student Body President Ralph Peebles,
a member of the YMCA Cabinet, sees no
need for a college chaplain. In his view
the chaplain’'s function as a_ student
counselor has been co-opted by the two

clinical psychologists available for this
function.

Peeples remarked, ‘This college had
better start setting priorities. Would
the chaplain's salary be better used to
help hire a clinical psychologist? is it
more important that we have better
lighting on this campus or is it more
important that we have a chaplain?"

Looking at the three proposals for a
college chaplain YMCA President Adrian
Long said, “I can't see any particular
advantage of any of them. There would
be reservations by students if the new
chaplain was a member of the faculty.

“If the college chaplain were also the
asscciate minister at the Davidson Cui-
lege Presbyterian Church he would be
too identified with organized religion.
The right type of personality could over-
come these difficulties, and these are
really the only two reasonable propos-
als.”

In Long's view the college will not
consider the possibility of an independent
chaplain. He pointed out that Woodman-
see was not satisfied with his independ-
ent role in which he was isolated from

the faculty and the church.

It is commonly known by those connect-
ed with the YMCA that Woodmansee felt
he did not have enough to do, since
about four months out of each year stu-
dents were not at Davidson.

In response to those who question the
need for a chaplain, Long said, ‘‘It is im-
portant to have someone around on an
informal basis to talk to students. The
problem with the clinical psychologists
is that you have to make an appoint-
ment to see them.’ Long could not cite
how many students sought the advice
of Woodmansee, but he believed it was
‘quite a few.”

YMCA President-elect Larry Duncan
said, ‘‘The new chaplain should be his
own man. Students would be uptight in
their dealings with the chaplain if he
were a member of the faculty. Also,
I do not believe that the Church would |
accept an associate minister connected
with Davidson College.”

Whether or not the proposed new chap-
lain will be a member of the faculty
may prove to be a touchy issue. Before
