Students form
Orthodox
Fellowship

By ADAM MarTIN
News Editor Emeritus

In a series of three articles,
the Davidsonian will explore
the status of religious life at
Davidson.

The Orthodox Christian
Fellowship (OCF) joined the
Religious Life Council last
month as Davidson’s ninth
Christian student organization.

Josh Pappas ’08 and Jordan
Iordanou ’08 co-founded the
OCF at primarily for the seven
Orthodox students currently
attending Davidson

“It’s a great way to keep
Orthodox Christians connected
to their faith during busy col-
lege life, and also introduce this
faith to other Christians and
non-Christians” Pappas said.

The OCF hopes _non-
Orthodox students will join
future meetings and events.

“OCF is not intended to
spread the Orthodox faith or
convert anybody,” said Pappas,
“but it’s just there if anyone is
interested in being part of a
group and possibly learning
some things about faith in gen-
eral.”

Houck is from Pappas’s
church parish in Minneapolis,
MN.

The OCF joins the five main-
line denominational Christian
fellowships and three non-

denominational Christian

. groups that are already on cam-
pus.

Almost 70 percent of

‘Davidson students have report-
ed themselves to be Christian,
according to incoming first-
year admissions forms for the
current classes.

As a pan-Orthodox organiza-
tion, the OCF represents nine
Canonical Orthodox
Jurisdictions -in the Americas,
including Armenian and
Romanian, Davidson’s chapter,
however, receives direct sup-
port from. one of those
Jurisdictions, the Greek
Orthodox Church.

A 68-foot swathe of trees was cleared from around power lines by
the ecological preserve and cross-country trails.

Duke Power clears trees

in ecological preserve

By Lex! HAMILTON
Senior Staff Writer

Duke Power Company began
clearing a 68-foot wide path
around one of their main transmis-
sion lines that runs’ through
Davidson College’s ecological pre-
serve over a month ago.

They are removing ‘danger
trees,’ which have the potential to
fall on a power line.

According to David Holthouser,
director of Davidson College’s
physical plant, the line is important
to both the college and the sur-
rounding town.

“It carries 44,000 volts and
serves our campus, the town of
Davidson, part of Cornelius and

part of Iredell County,” Holthouser
said. “Duke has a right of way for
this transmission line that is 68 feet
wide...and they have the right to
keep that clear of trees. They also
have the additional right to clear
‘danger trees’ beyond their 68 foot
right of way.”

The company started clearing
trees surrounding the power line in
Cornelius and worked toward
Davidson.

As they approached the campus,
however, they were clearing 100
feet of trees.

At the college’s request, Duke
Power ceased its clearance activi-
ties, and negotiations regarding

College fosters relationship
with The Pines residents

By COLLEEN MCKOWN
Senior Staff Writer

The Pines at Davidson, a retire-
ment community in the town of
Davidson, has a history of very
close ties with Davidson College.

“The college is very supportive
of The Pines,” said former
Davidson economics professor and
Pines resident Louise Nelson.
“Many college officials are on the
Board of Directors. The connection
between the two is a valuable and
very close connection.”

The Pines opened in 1988, with
the help of the college, the local

townspeople, _ and Davidson
College Presbyterian Church
(DCPC).

The Pines provided an opportu-

nity for retired faculty to stay in the
Davidson area, and the first group
of residents was largely comprised
of people affiliated with the col-
lege.

A strong connection still remains
between Davidson College and
The Pines. Currently, 12 retired
Davidson professors and about the
same number of professors’ wid-
ows live at The Pines.

In addition, several programs
that promote and implement a
direct connection between The
Pines and the college are in place.

Learning in Retirement (LIR) is
one such program. Through the
LIR program, Davidson professors
are invited to The Pines to give lec-

Teaching with tenure:

Are student concerns ever addressed?

By DarRcIE DRAUDT
Staff Writer

Davidson College emphasizes
the quality of students’ classroom
experiences by stressing its stu-
dent-faculty ratio of 10.8:1 and its
96.8 percent of professors with ter-
minal degrees.

Some students, however, feel
powerless when it comes to chal-
lenging tenured professors with
high levels of job security and aca-
demic freedom who do not commit
to teaching a challenging or organ-
ized course.

“The one situation in which I did
not feel my professor was doing his
job with integrity made me ques-
tion the extent to which students
have a say in ensuring the quality
of academics here,” Julie Ruble
06 said. “I wrote a specific and
thorough evaluation, but I don’t
know if anyone even read it. That
worries me.”

Course Evaluations

After a professor receives tenure,
the only institutional opportunity
for students to review professors’
performances is through the course
evaluations at the end of the semes-
ter. Before 1984, caqurse evalua-
tions included a short form that
asked students to rate the course on
a numerical scale.

After realizing the form did not
show professors where change
might be needed, the faculty
switched to a longer form in
February 1984. This new form,
still used by faculty, includes one
page of specific questions and

preview on page 6.

The Theatre Department’s fall musical begins today. Read the

another of general questions.

“We hope faculty would be sen-
sitive to a legitimate concern
raised,” Dean of Faculty Dr. Clark
Ross said.

In addition to being available to
the professor every semester, the
course evaluations are reviewed by
the Dean of Faculty and the depart-
ment chair at most two out of every
seven years.

Professors receive the course
evaluations and can use them to
plan for future courses. Professor
of Political Science Dr. Pat Sellers
uses the forms to review what
worked and what did not work as
well each semester.

“T couldn’t put students through
the same problems again and
again,” he said.

Students also have the option of
speaking directly with professors if
they are unsatisfied with their
courses. Ross, however,’ recom-
mends not waiting until the end of
the semester before addressing
concerns.

If a student feels that his prob-
lems are still unresolved after
speaking with the professor, he
should talk with the department
chair, followed by the dean of fac-
ulty.

“A student should come to talk to
me only when it’s ‘serious,’” Ross
said.

Student Concerns

Although students recognize the
value of these evaluations, they
also wonder whether they will be
