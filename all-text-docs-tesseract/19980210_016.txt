Cats win in OT

A trip to Belk brings a loss to UTC

By MicuaeL J. Kruse
The Wildcat Report

After spending the first half of the
season finding ways to lose, the men’s
basketball team is now finding ways to
win.

” The most recent example:

Davidson posted a season low in
points, got outrebounded 45-31, and
watched
scoring
leader
Mark
Donnelly
tally a
mere four points, yet managed to claim
its fifth victory in six tries Feb. 4 at Belk
Arena, topping defending league cham-
pion Chattanooga 53-52 in overtime.

“Trials either develop you or de-
stroy you,” coach Bob McKillop said
after the game, referring to the Wild-
cats’ early-season struggles. “Maybe
the experience of losing taught our guys
something.”

Both teams struggled offensively
throughout, as Chattanooga shot 32.3
percent from the floor overall. ~

The Mocs misfired at a sickly 20.6
clip in the first 20 minutes — but took a
24-22 lead into the locker room.
Davidson was not much better, con-
verting only 34.8 percent of its field
goals.

But the intense competition be-
tween the two most decorated programs
in Southern Conference basketball his-
tory more than made up for the lack of
offensive artistry.

The largest lead by either team
was five — a 22-17 Chattanooga ad-
vantage four minutes before intermis-
sion and the Wildcats and Mocs
battled to four ties in the 45 minutes of
play.

Two of those deadlocks occurred
in the final two seconds of regulation.

Sitting at 46-46 in the game’s final
minute, the Wildcat defense forced a

turnover by Mocs guard Isaac Conner
with seven seconds showing on the
clock.

Wildcat guard Davor Halbauer
took the inbounds pass from Landry
Kosmalski and drove the length of the
court before converting a nifty scoop
shot to give Davidson an apparent 48-
46 win.

“As soon as the shot went in, I
thought the game was over,” said
Halbauer, who scored a season-high 15
points. “I was almost in the shower.”

After further review, though, the
referees ruled that two seconds re-
mained, giving the Mocs new life.

And first-year head coach Henry
Dickerson’s squad took advantage.
Chattanooga forward Francisco Colon
caught a length-of-the-court inbounds
pass near the free throw line. He turned
and shot long, but teammate David
Phillips was there for the put-back,
barely beating the buzzer to send the
game into an extra frame. -

The Wildcats gained the immedi-
ate upper hand in overtime, building
leads of 51-48 and 53-50.

“We didn’t have a pity party,”
McKillop said. “We made a statement
early in overtime. That’sa great sign of
maturity and growth.”

But it was the Mocs with the last
chance to win. After a timeout, Chatta-
nooga tried to set up an isolation play
for hot-shooting guard Chuck Barker,
who led the Mocs with 13 points,-all of
them coming in the second half.

Ina frenzied attempt to get him the
ball in the waning seconds, though, Ali
Ton swiped Idris Harper’s pass to seal
the hard-fought victory for the Wild-
cats.

“We just finished strong, and that’s
been the story in the last couple of
games,” said sixth man Ben Ebong,
who paced Davidson with 16 points and
contributed seven rebounds. “Now
there’s no anxiety going into late-game
situations.”

Correction: Last week, the Davidsonian Sports Section staff prematurely
stated that the Southern States Tournament was to be held last Thursday .
through Saturday. It is, in fact, to held this week, Thursday through Saturday.
Now that you have had an extra week of notice, you have no excuse not to go.
Additional corrections will be forthcoming in future issues. — The DSS staff

Ton’s last-second layup brings UNCG down

By Micuak- J. Kruse
Senior Staff Writer

GREENSBORO — The men’s
basketball team stole another one Sat-

urday
[wil dcats 69 night here
: at Fleming
|UNCG 68 Gym on
the cam-
pus of UNCG.
Literally.

Ali Ton made a game-saving steal
for the second consecutive contest, as
the Wildcats escaped with a 69-68 vic-

tory over the Spartans.

Down by one, UNCG had 25 sec-
onds to get off a potentially game-win-
ning shot, but ended up calling two
timeouts before Ton’s heroics with four
seconds left.

“We showed a lot of different looks
and created some confusion,” said coach

-Bob McKillop, whose squad has now

won six straight games within the South-
ern Conference. ‘That was our hope.”
“IT wanted to deny my man the
ball,” said Ton, who collected 10 points,
six assists, and three steals in his 33
minutes. “I just anticipated it.

“IT hope we don’t come to that
point again. But I think we’ve been
blessed as a team to come up with those
plays.”

Ton’s heroics. enabled Davidson
to overcome a pair of stellar individual
efforts by Spartans Matt Javit and
Demetrius Cherry.

Javit, a senior guard, had a career
night in the first half alone, scoring 26
points on 9-for-12 shooting, including
6-of-8 marksmanship from beyond the
threepoint arc.

Thanks to a stifling zone defense
the Wildcats used effectively in the

second half, Javit tallied just two points
after halftime, misfiring on all three of
his longdistance attempts in the frame.

“Their zone was tough to get open

on,” said Javit, whose previous scoring .

best was 21. “‘All my points in the first
half came on man-to-man. They did a
really good job on me in the second
half.” Cherry, though,
picked up the slack, notching 14 of his
20 points in the final 20 minutes.

But it wasn’t enough, as the Wild-
cats limited UNCG to 29.6 percent
shooting in the second half and — again
— made just enough plays necessary to

win.

The final score was only
Davidson’s sixth lead of the game, as
Davidson erased UNCG’s 32-26 half-
time advantage.

“No way we would have done this
a month ago,” McKillop said. “To-
night, Wednesday night (an overtime
win over Chattanooga), it was our play-
ers stepping up to the plate.”

Mark Donnelly led the Wildcats
with 17 points, while Ben Ebong re-
corded his second double-double of the
season, contributing 12 points and 11
rebounds.
