For coach Bob McKillop and the
rest of the men’s basketball staff, the
first day of practice always seems strik-
ingly similar to Christmas — the family
is all gathered together, a host of new
gifts lie in wait of opening, excitement
abounds, and glad tidings fill the air.

When the Wildcats held their first
practice session of the 1998-99 basket-
ball season Oct. 17, 10 veterans and
four rookies made a pledge to continue
the superlative effort that in 1997-98
earned Davidson a Southern Confer-
ence championship and its first NCAA
appearance in 12 years.

Among the 10 veterans is junior
forward Landry Kosmalski, the confer-
ence freshman of the year in 1996-97,
for whom the first day of practice
couldn’t possibly have come soon
enough.

“The preseason is just so long, and

with all the great feelings we have about
this year’s team,” Kosmalski said, ‘“‘we
justreally couldn’t wait to get out there.”

Senior forward Ben Ebong, ateam
captain and last year’s league tourna-
ment MVP, feels precisely the same
way.

“Tt feels good to finally get out of
the preseason,” Ebong - said.
“Everything’s gone really well so far.”

Assistant coach Jason Zimmerman
says that when players arrived in Belk
Arena for the first day of practice, they

‘may very well have been under the

impression that they’d never really left
Davidson’s Chambers classroom
buiding.

“The first week of practice always
involves alot of teaching,” Zimmerman
said.

“To keep the pace going, we make
an extra special effort to incorporate
activities as well.”

Coach Bob McKillop is quick to
note a distinction between rookies and

veterans’ experience of the first week
of practice.

“Veterans have the advantage of
already understanding terminology and
techniques,” McKillop said.

Ebong added: “Freshmen are learn-
ing a lot and trying to get up to speed,
but veterans have been through this all

. before.

“We're just trying to make sure no
one misses a beat. We want to pick up
right where we left off last year.”

Key to arenewal of success for the
Wildcats in 1998-99 is smooth transfer
of knowledge and insight from veterans
to rookies.

So far, according to McKillop, the
process has come off without a hitch.

Said McKillop: “The rookies have
been extremely fortunate that the veter-
ans are lending so much moral and
technical support, walking them through
things, and helping out in a number of
different capacities.”

views veterans’ support of rookies as
something unquestioned.

“Freshman have no idea what to
expect,” Holmes said. “We understand
that. We’re there to help.”

“Even veterans have anxiety com-
ing in to the first practice, because ev-
ery year it’s a new team,” Ebong said.
“The dimensions have changed,”

Assistant coach Matt Matheny put
it more succinctly: “You can’t help but
be anxious coming in as a freshman on
the first day.”

So how would rookies character-
ize their first week of practice?

“Tt was probably the hardest thing
basketball-wise I did in my life,” said
Brian Turner, a rookie guard.

“T got hit from all different angles
with things to learn. I got hit by people
too. It was all very intense.”

Turner cited Senior leadership as a
huge asset to the 1998-99 Wildcats.

“The veterans have been helping
me out a lot with things I don’t know,”

TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 1998

First week of men’s practice: Excitement, adjustment

he said. “I know I'll be adjusted. I'll be
alright.”

Fellow freshman Martin Ides, a 7-
foot-2, 280-pound native of the Czech
Republic, said his main goal thus far at
practice has been to cut down on per-
sonal mistakes.

“T didn’t get yelled at as much
today in practice,” he said, “‘so I guess
I’m doing alright.”

McKillop has no unrealistic ex-
pectations for how long it will take the
1998-99 Wildcats to gel together and
come into their own.

“It’s a step-by-step process,”
McKillop said. “Our guys are listening
and learning, and I’m very impressed
with the progress they’ve shown so
far.”

Added Matheny: “Our goal is to
get better and better each day. The
freshmen have made tremendous strides
already and I’d say we’re right about
where we want to be going into our first
scrimmage.”

THE COACH

What they are saying about McKillop

Emil Parker, Davidson sports information director:
“He's the most intense coach we've had since Lefty
Driesell. He’s bringing the program back to the
heights Lefty hadit at. In terms of organization, he’s
unsurpassed. His in-game coaching is the best I’ve
ever seen.

“He hadit clear in his mind what type of system
he needed when he came here, and has done an
excellent job of recruiting players for that system.
That's why the program is in as good a state as it is
right now.”

Judi Murphy, Research Technician, Office of Plan-
ning and Institutional Research: “Ever since he and
his family first moved to Davidson, they’ve been
extremely wellreceived by the community and the
campus. ‘

“He’s done a lot to promote professionalism
and good spirit within the basketball program. He
has a true interest in each one of his players. He
spends social time with them as well as court time.
He’s a very good coach and a big plus to Davidson.
We're all pleased that he’s here.”

John Kuykendall, President Emeritus and Profes-
sor of Religion: “He took a program which had fallen
into disrepair and had both the patience and confi-
dence to build it up again from a very low founda-
tion.

“The people he’s brought here as colleagues
in coaching and as student-athletes have not only
contributed in one way or another to the basketball

program; they've contributed to the fabric of this |

community.

“You never have to doubt Bob McKillop about
the character of someone he wants to bring here to
play basketball. It’s very gratifying to see- him
having the kind of success he’s had the last two or
three years. | would have to say, though, that in
times when he’s been deeply disappointed, his
strength of character has still shone through.”

‘Bobby Vagt, President: “We are fortunate to have in
Bob McKillop a coach wellschooled in the art of
basketball. Bob passes on to his players a sense of
responsibility, caring and honesty. He embodies in
his program that work ethic and discipline which is

central to Davidson College. | find his basketball
program absolutely consistent with what goes on
within the school. He has a rare gift.”

Dean Jones, Director of Development: “Bob McKillop
exerts a positive influence on all his players and on
the campus as a whole. It’s clear that his players
respect him very much.

“That's particularly admirable in a day when
there are so many negative reports circulating
about coaches’ relationships with players. We’ve
been very fortunate and pleased to have Bob here.”

Tom Shandley, Dean of Students: “Bob McKillop’s
program has pulled us together as a community
and generated great pride in Davidson.

“One looks back at the last game of last year
when we played Michigan in the first round of the
NCAA tournament and remembers what a time of
unity and fun it was for the entire community. The
success of Coach Mckillop and his team enabled
that.”
