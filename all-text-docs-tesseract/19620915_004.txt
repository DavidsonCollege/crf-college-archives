“We have tried this summer
to make changes in existing
facilities: in order to meet the
changes now being mede in
teaching methods, Currie
said. The Dome Room of
Chambers has been converted
into a 175-seat lecture room.
When finished, as it soon will
be, the dome will be air con-
ditioned, acoustically improv-
ed, and will have facilities for
the use of audio-visual equip-
ment.

“While the new Humanities

course will use the dome as a
lecture room, the work was not
done solely for that reason,”
dormant barfberry trees to the Currie stressed. “Any time it is
trans-Patterson court mud cald- desirable to bring other classes
together for lectures, the dome
can be used. That is the reason

number of seats.”

There is new furniture in the
basements of the Eumenean and
Philanthropic Halls to make it
possible for two seminar rooms
to be-in each basement. Humani-
ties will use these four rooms

seminars: will also be held in
them. -

The language lab is now at
the north end of Chambers on
the third floor and features
forty booths instead of last
year’s twenty-four. The control
room is in the center of the
lab. Twenty-four of the booths
to the left of the contro! rcom
will be used by students with
language lab assignments, the
same as last year.

the improved facilities.

The above three changes
were made possible through
the Duke Endowment. The En-
lowment also made it possible
for the college to build two
all-weather fennis courts.
Work on them is now being
finished.

The south basement of Cham-
bers has been completely re-
finished in order to provide of-
fice space for the new Depart-
ment of Public Relations and
Development. That basement
also contains an area for faculty
services such as mimeographing,
a space for automatic filing sys-
tems should the college decide
to mechanize its record and ad-
ministrative system, and space
for a computor.

Currie said that the college is
now studying seriously the ques-
tion of acquiring a computor to
be used for instructional pur-
poses. Such a machine would
give science, math, and business
majors a chance to familiarize
themselves with something that
will be an important part of

their lives upon graduation.
