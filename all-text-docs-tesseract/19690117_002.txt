THE SYSTEM'S TWO FACES: ACCEPTANCE...

In Pursuit

“Sure. there’s 4 lot wrong with the
fraternity system. but. . _

That feeble excuse for a defective
social system was cranked .out hun-
dreds of times last week by fraternitv
members. An admission of weakness—
but at the same time a verbal device
to perpetuate that weakness

To many fraternity men. that tacit
hint of reform to anxious. question-
ning freshmen is already forgotten.
It served its purpose. and now it can
be abandoned. But to many others,
who took what they said seriously.
it is a promise to keep.

Of course. sonie fraternity men re-
acted to thé opposition of Joe Murphy
and the Independent group in a man-
ner resembling a spoiled child: they
pouted.

In others. however. the questions
raised last week will be added to pre-
vious convictions and the realization
that. what we are doing here. in our
social set-up, is wrong. .

One fraternity president has al-
ready. announced his intentions of
trying to do something about it. and
his offer to resign was refused bv his

The spirit for change is here, and

Heads Up,

To a group that calls itself the
Student Violent Non-Action Commit-
tee (SVNA), give credit for the most
novel idea yet in the protest of Rich-
ard Nixon’s inauguration.

They're calling their protest a cross
country flush.

This is the plan: When Mr. Nixon
takes the oath of office next Monday
in Washington, he will conclude it
with the traditional final pledge to
“uphold and defend the Constitution
of the United States to the best of my
ability. so help me God.” And on
“me,” SVNA supporters all across the
country will flush the nearest toilet.

“We realize, of course, that we
may not be able to reach every toi-
let,” the group said in a letter to

_. AND REJECTION

Mr. Nixon

campus newspapers last week, “but
we hope that, with the cooperation
of organizations like yours, we shall
be able to reach a majority of them.”
_ Targets of the group will be toilets
in not only dorms, apartments and
classroom buildings, but also hotels,
restaurants, railroad stations and pri-
vate homes. The scheme has been
dubbed a “Flush For Freedom.”

Just what to make of all this we are
a little uncertain. There can be no
challenging the novelty of the plan,
of course, but we tend to go along
with the reaction of a Chicago colum-
nist.

Said he: ‘“‘My bet is they won’t come
close to matching what happens dur-
ing a commercial in a Bears’ telecast.”

Over Their Limit

When one of those eager - beaver
politicians comes by your room in the
next few days, asking for your vote
for the Student Senate, don’t ask him
about his platform.

Just ask him if he’s going to attend
Senate meetings.

Obviously, a platform proposal
isn't going to get effected if the one
proposing it doesn’t bother to attend
the meetings. And if the record of
this year’s Senate is any indication,
a lot of ideas must be lying idle.

Judging by the attendance report
on page three, most of the Senators
have a pretty good record. What the

record doesn’t show, however, are
the three times the Senate couldn't
muster a quorum and the incredibly
sloppy job done by the Senate’s sec-
retaries. . ,

In other words, our statistics are
hardly accurate.

Standing rules of the Senate per-
mit each Senator four absences. When
a Senator goes over his limit, the rules
say, he should be fined $2.50 per ab-
sence. A good policy—but apparently
ignored.

Don't look now—but at least two
Senators owe us $2.50 each.

Sikes: Independents
Left With Dilemma

To The Editor:

Congratuiations to all of us
who got bids and joined a
fraternity. Some of us are
the fraternity type; it should
prove to be a good life Some
of us aren't: life won't seem
that great but it will be a
lot better than being an In
dependent. For the Indepen
dent. well

Who should get the blame
for the plight of the Inde.
pendents? For the life of the
Independent.is the life of a
person without any social
outlet.

They have no place to have
a party or take a date un
less one’ wants to call the
College Union such a place.
Of course many Indepen
dents are invited to fraterni-
ty parties. but the feeling
of being an outsider can
hardly be avoided when we
consider the “close-knit uni

of a fraternity.

Also Independents must
wait in line for every meal.
svhile people at the fraterni-
ties sit.down and eat. Whose
fault is it that the Indepen
dents do not have the same
opportunity as the fraternity
brothers?

The first possibility is that
the fraternities are at fault

because they did not choose.

everyone to he a member.
This argument is ridiculous.
for fraternities exist on the
premise that the kind of peo-
ple who should live in a fra-
ternity house are the kind of
people that all the existing
members desire.

This year the fraternities
picked many people who
weren't the  ‘‘fraterniiy
type.” In fact, it is quite ob-

‘vious that fraternities have

picked the non-fraternity
type for several years. This
occurrence seems to be self-
preservation but also to pro-
vide people with an organiz.

ed social ouvet.

Still, however. Indepen:
dents exist. Why? I say i
is because they aren't the
kind of people the fratern-

ities feel would best fi: the

fraternity.

Obviously this is true: not
all people are meant for fra.
ternities. (Whoever heard 0°

87 percent of a class being -

the ‘fraternity type’ as was
the Class of ‘72): neither.
however. aré alt the Inde
pendents meant -for social
celibacy.

Whose fault is it
the Independents ests |:
out any social oitl 2° -Tt
fauh lies with the admin
stration, faculty and students
of Davidson College who sup
port the fraternity system
and no other system.

Who rents the houses on
Patterson Court to the fra-
ternities and not the Indepen-
dents? The administration
‘has decided that the frater-
nities alone shall be allowed
to rent houses on Patterson
Court.

Those students and faculty °

who support only the frater-
nity system are just as much
at fault as the administra-
tion for the Independent di-
lemma.

The solution to the dilem-
ma of the Independent will
be realized when the admin-
istration, faculty, and stu-

dents admit that far from
all people benefit from fra
ternities.

The solution will be reaiiz
ed when those who either
didn't go through rush. who
went through rush but didn't
get a bid. or who got a bid
but decided that fraternities

weren't for them get an or-
ganized social outlet equal
to the fraternities. It is for
those kind of people who are
mature enough to realize
that fraternities are not for
them this letter is written.

Vagt Appreciates
Murphy Critique

ED. NOTE: The following
is a letter from Interfraterni.
ty Council President Bobby
Vagt to Student Body Presi-
dent Joe Murphy and the
group of Independents who
sent letters to freshmen dur-
ing cush.

J would like to express pub-
lely my appreciation to Mr.
Joe Murphy for his speech
in the assembly program
last. week and to the Inde-
perdents woo published a tet
wr eacg. day during rush.

I believe that they played
a significant role én the suc-
cess of- rush this vear. While
this was probably not the in-
tended objective, the results
of their efforts were a much
more serious attitude assum-

ad

ed by the fraternity men and
a degree of depth and per-
cep:ion, unknown. in previous
years. in the questions put
forth by the rushees.

I admit that the one
sidedness of the arguments
and. the too frequent exag
geration of some points
proved a source of. some con.
cern. However, this was
greatly outweighed by the
frankness and unrestraimt
which prevailed on the
court, the. fruits. of the criti
cism unleashed by Mr. Mur.
phy arid this group of Inde-
pendents.

Again. on behalf of the
IFC, 1 express my sincere
gratitude for what might be
a long needed stimulus.

SCAR Recruits Black Students,
Enables Them To Attend Tufts

By Jntercollegiate Press

Twenty black students who
might not have had the op-
portunity to attend college
under normal admissions
standards were enrolled in
the freshman class at Tufts
University last term through
a student-run agency called
SCAR.

Recruited by Students Con-
cerned About Racism, the 20
are guaranteed total finan-
cial aid, housing and tutor-
ing; the average was $3,000
per year. (Tufts’ tuition is
2,300.) The group includes
13 in Liberal Arts and En-

Gods, Graves And Scholars

gineering and seven in Jack.
son College for Women.

“Some of these young men
and women never would
have been able to attend col-

lege.’ says Assistant Dean of

Admissions Roy M. Moore.

The recruiting drive, which
was carried out by 150 under-
graduates. began last April
12 after a brief and peaceful
confrontation between Dean
of Admissions John C. Palm-
er and 300 students demand-
ing additional male and fe-
male black students be ad.
mitted this year.

The Student Government Myth

oon we will be having SGA elections, so this is a
cord time for all members of the association to try to
evaluate objectively student government and its ef-
fect on the total life of Davidson students. _

This is the time the SGA organization has its great-
est effect on most students. It is a time of politicking,
back-biting and downright lying—in short, a brilliant
display of the worst that this system has to offer. Each
year. students force themselves to remember the list
of committees, positions and constitutional hierarchies
that they will forget as soon as they leave the polling

laces. ;

P They must also remember what fraternity brother
is running for what office. and be certain that even
the lowliest pledge finds his way to the ballot box.

In speaking of student government, it is impossible
to sav anything basically new. Glancing through past
records will convince observers that the same per
centage of students vote and participate in campus
government now as did years ago. There have been
various student and faculty committees to investi-
gate the vroblem. A new constitution was written,
but according to two candidates for SGA president,
that document has been largely ignored by campus
politicos. oe

We have a new code of student responsibility, gra-
ciously handed to us by the powers that be. But it
seems obvious that the trustees still intended to reg-
ulate student. conduct. If you don't ‘believe this,
“abuse” the code, and see how long it will remain
in. effect.

Dissatisfaction with the entire concept of student
government is present in the, student body, not just
among the lethargic, but among those who realize.
that cliqueism and superficiality have permeated the
system. Why, it’s almost like a fraternity! !

When a student realizes this. he is better able to
see the absurdity and artificiality of a government
which has neither final authority nor ultimate control
over a Situation. It is a government bounded by a reg-
ulation from outside forces—i.e., faculty and admin
istration.

in the words of leftist Ray Mungo: “Student leaders
do not exist, because they lack ultimate authority and
ultimate control.” .

One of the several basic weaknesses of the present
system is the self-perpetuating “prevailing attitudes”
which enter a power structure and block outside ideas.
The Senate has a way of picking the same people time
after time for study committees. thus perpetuating
“prevailing ideas” of the power structure.

One of the most wasteful aspects of the system
seems to be the time spent campaigning for election.
Each year students are subjected to the same worn-
out promises and half-coated garbage, which seniors
and juniors have learned to accept as drivel. The
platforms sometimes look like the doodling of a can-
didate for president of the sixth grade at the Davidson
Elementary School.

One of the alternatives might be to do away with the
Senate and all other divisive influences and govern
entirely by campus referendum, Other than for minor
functions, student government would be a giant Un-
ion — open to everyone! ;

That is just one of the alternatives that students
could come up with if they could just free themselves
from the cliques and prevailing attitudes which con-
trol the present system.

But maybe the fault is not institutional, but lies with
the personalities involved.
