Epes decries Wilensky’s tirades

To the Editor:

I generally resist the urge to write
letters to the editor; often, that takes
a lot of will power.

This week, will power lost.

In the last two issues prior to this
one, Mark Wilensky has fulminated
against the current draft of the
Statement of Student Rights and
Responsibilities. That’s fine; I can
criticize it too.

But after Column One, I saw Mark
and spent an hour or so discussing his
column, trying to correct some of its
errors.

In the course of our conversation,
Mark picked up information which
seems to have fed°Column Two. The
latter, instead of containing correc-
tions, added new errors.

This time, I think I’ll do the
correcting myself.

I'll credit Mark for one thing: he
had apparently not realized that some
items in the Statement, apart from
media, had been controversial. He has
since pointed them out.

For example: ‘‘With the surprising
‘help of Sam Spencer... freedom of
assembly and speech... were pre-
served.’’ True, except that the

adjective ‘‘surprising’’ is superfluous, -

insulting, and (except for Mark)
inaccurate. Dr. Spencer favors the
J.S. Mill notion of the ‘marketplace
of ideas”’ --so long as we deal in ideas.

My real gripe: I am somewhat
flattered to be lumped with three
students as part of a ‘‘liberal’’
majority on the Subcommittee,
though I doubt Mark considers
‘‘Tiberal’’at the top of his words of
praise. But the four of us ‘‘liberals’’
never outvoted, as was contended,
Dr. McKelway, Dean Johnston, and
Dean Terry. I did tell Mark that we
could if we had to. We didn’t, because
the only vote taken was to vote out
Draft 9. I do not recall dissent.

Moreover, Dean Johnston could at’

most have attended one meeting; the
bulk of our work was during the
tenure of Dr. Bevan. We reached

agreement by consensus which ,

usually included the support of Dr.
McKelway, Dr. Bevan, and Dean

Terry.
I agree with Mark on at least one

thing. The current media proposal--’

which should have been negotiated in
committee, but wasn’t-- is weaker
than I would care to have it. It is
probably the best that can be done,

Stephenson jab cited

To the Editor:
Your news story and editorial last

week...concerning the Chambermaid '

situation represented some of the best
work your paper has done in some

time. The news COverAKS of this issue
over the past months has been excel-

False score

To the Editor:

According to last week’s IMAC
column, the mighty Ockham’s Razor
was defeated in softball by Richard-
son I, 6-3. In fact, the Razor
triumphed, 13-4: not even a close
shave. Nothing is more insulting to a
senior than to be falsely accused of
losing to mere freshmen—unless it is
to be so accused by those queens of
sportswriting, the Three Fairies.

lent and your editorial was to ite
point.

No doubt some of the Stephenson
apologists and frightened secretaries
will be shaken because a fervor has
developed and revert back to being
docile. They’ll claim Stephenson and
the college have always been benevo-
lent and fair, and that their rights are
being protected. Fear of boat rocking
is not limited to the SGA hierarchy.

In fact, the handbook is necessary.
At present, policy is set at whim.
While it may (or may not) be fair
today, it could change tomorrow
without warning or reason. This
College is continually fighting any
attempt to have standardized policies
that apply to all. The written
statement is required for fair policies
of promotion and salary raise. In fact,
the College would be ina possible
legal bind without such a document to

defend against a charge of bias or

racism.

You came down hard on Stephen-
son. Hopefully hard enough. It’s ine
for Bob Currie, Craven Wi

Sam Spencer to come down just eA

hard. If no action is taken, the

secretaries and the College as a whole
will suffer.

and I can imagine worse.

I think it proper for the College to
be concerned about its image, but at
least as proper to have an image it can
be proud of. For me, that includes
almost total freedom for the student
media. (‘‘Almost’’ should be defined:
we have from the first contemplated
editors subject to advice and, through
due process, to removal. The debate
has been over who removes, why, and
how.)

I fail to see why Mark considers it
helpful to take a complex matter and
convert it into a personal attack on
Munce, Baskin, and Dr. Spencer. In
doing so, he operates at the level of a
recent guest of the College who,
speaking to the issue, displayed little
beyond interest, opinion, and
ignorance.

It should not be the goal of a strong
proponent of a free press to enter an

argument in the fashion in which a

cartoon portrayed him: one eye open,

and only one ear in evidence.

Lamas praised

To the Editor:

May we take this opportunity to
commend Andy Lamas for his recent
article concerning the hourly employ-
ees’ handbook. To our knowledge his
reporting was accurate; this issue and
others have been side-stepped.

We, too, are members and support
the purpose of the Chambermaids and
choose to work with the established
structures but are concerned with a
management style which at times
seems incompatible with our stated
purposes—specifically, to establish
understanding and communication.

A Dissenting Opinion

Learning not to act ?

To the Editor:

I am learning a variety of things at
Davidson. Each course opens up
entirely new areas of the world for me
to explore and understand and quench
my thirst to know. Amidst this
multitude of facts, I am also learning
a value, and each course seems to be
teaching me the same one. The
process of this education is forming
for me a value that I will probably
never forget--even if I want to.

For example, I study how children
internalize social attitudes to the
extent that they believe that they are
their own, and yet I still want to be a
doctor or a lawyer. I learn how our
educational system successfully keeps
the rich rich and the creative stifled.
Still, I enjoy the former and, with
increasing infrequency, su from
the latter. I learty how the r, the
criminal and the insane suffer unjust-
ly, but I don’t know many and
understand none. I learn how racial
prejudice is ingrained into almost
everyone along with other typifica-
tions to fill in our vacumns of
inexperience. Still, I have little or no
relationships with other ethnics and I
don’t take out girls that are too
different from, me or most others. I

hear through the grapevine of the

superficiality of relationships here,
but I’ve been either too blind or too
busy to notice them. Seeing without
seeing? Sensation without percep-
tion?

I read about the detriments of an
institutionalized diet, then I eat at
Slater or a Frat. I discover the delight

of vigorous daily exercise, so I take a
dose of those exhausting intramurals
twice weekly, that is, if I don’t have a
test the next day. I read about the
advan and necessities of freedom
in education, then I fill my course
schedule with major and area require-
ments. I hear that true understanding
is also subjective, then I study theory
and read about application. I learn
about the great importance religion
has had in man’s history and then
dream of that ideal someday when I
can come home from a nice job to my
nice house in the country and go
fishing and camping every nice week-
end. Shall I forever eat what i is placed
before me?

The point is that while I am being
educated with lots and lots of
wonderful and disturbing facts, I am
also being indoctrinated with the
same value in every course. I am
learning how not to act on what I
have learned needs to be done in the
world. By now I have got an
intellectual non-action thoroughly
mastered. Shall I order padding for
my armchair? Soon it will be a rocker.

Then I notice that there are only a
few faculty and staff on the campus
who are actively involved in social
and educational innovation to any
degree, and that there are a great
many more who only, ap rove of
improvement. Education? Indoctrina-
tion? How am I what here?
