THE DAVIDSONIAN

OPINIONS

MONDAY, DECEMBER 9 1991

By Jerry S. Stockdale

On November 22, Icame home
to: America after three weeks in
India with Davidson’s Semester-
In-India Program. My trip was the
experience of a lifetime, replete
with adventure, learning, laughter,
great companionship and ahealthy
dose of culture shock. (And, oh
yes, diarrhea, too.) For those who
are interested, I will be writing
about the program and about my
adventures in the winter issue of
the Davidson Journal.

But that is not what I wish to
write about here and now. I wish to
write about the shock of re-adjust-
ing to life at Davidson.

The interesting thing about my
culture shock in India is how up-
lifting and energizing it ultimately
was. In the midst of the most con-
fusing, frustrating, disorienting
moments of all I felt the power of
the experience. I understood it was
necessary to feel hopelessly lost
and out of control before I could
rebound and start to understand
what I had seen and heard.

Another interesting thing about
culture shock is the reverse proc-
ess. Several people “warned” me
that my re-entry into American
society might also be confusing
and disorienting, although it surely
wouldn’t last as long. So I was
prepared, or so I thought. My re-
entry was fairly smooth andI didn’t
feel strange at all, until it hit me
blindside, from quarters I never
expected at all. What I was not
prepared for was the shock of drop-
ping back in on life at Davidson.

The very day I came back, I
read two articles about Davidson
in The Charlotte Observer. All of
you know the ones I mean --
“Backlash of intolerance sweeps
— colleges in Carolinas” and “Col-
lege official slams intolerance.”
Sobering, to say the least. Also
sad.

The second item to hit me was
an emergency phone call early
Saturday morning from Ray
Thrower. I had been up half the
night and had just gone back to
bed, jet lagged to the max. Ray
called to say that someone had
gotten drunk and fallen off a ledge
at the PiKA House; a helicopter
had been flown in and medics
couldn’t get any response at first.
There was no word yet from the
hospital, but they were afraid he
might be dead or seriously injured.
Media calls were coming in and I
was needed.

Wham! I was tired and wor-
ried and in no mood to deal with
this, but this was all part of our
standard protocol in emergency
situations. The more I thought
aboutit, I got pissed off. One more
case of drunken stupidity to handle!
A selfish reaction to a serious situ-
ation, I know, but it’s what I hon-
estly felt. I wondered if Will Terry
or John Kuykendall or others have
that kind of reaction, too. After all,
they getmuch more wrapped up in
these problems than I ever do.

I got lucky this time. I was able
to reach Bill Giduz, director of
news and photography, and he was
able to handle the media on the
’ scene. We all got lucky this time.
As youall know, the student wasn’t

The Dark Side of Davidson

dead, just dead drunk. He was re-
leased and is presumably okay now.
He wasn’t even a Davidson stu-
dent, but that is irrelevant to the
deeper problem.

The third item was another Ob-
server story on Monday morning,
the one covering the Sunday eve-
ning forum on racial issues. I was
shocked to read of the incident of
the anonymous message on the
answering machine. Excuse me for
being so naive at age 40,
but how could something

ing on such a wide scale and such
a sustained basis. I have seen it in
individuals, yes. But I have never
seen it so institutionalized before.
The ritual of drinking till you pass
out seems to be glorified and lion-
ized at Davidson more than ever.
Some students appear to lead a life
of trashed Tuesdays, wasted
Wednesdays and thirsty Thursdays

followed by weekend blowouts that,

last through Monday and thecycle

Speaking of ugly, let me turn
to the problem of bigotry and intol-
erance. I may have been drunk and
stupid before, but Iam proud to say
that (to the best of my understand-
ing) I have never been bigoted and
intolerant of those who are differ-
ent from me. Therefore, this prob-
lem is much harder for me to un-
derstand and ultimately more dis-
turbing to me.

I have been employed by the

college for ten years and
I have never seen so

like this happen at a place
like Davidson! As I drove
up to work (from Char-
lotte) the moming was
sunny and beautiful. In-
side I was dark and seeth-
ing.

I spent much of the
day telling people about
my trip, foreverybody was

eager to hear all about it,
but I couldn’t shake_the
depression inside and I also talked
about that. I saw Jack Perry on
Main Street and he asked me how
I felt. talked about the dark side of
Davidson, not about my trip. Jack,
the eternal optimist, reminded me
of what I knew somewhere deep
inside but needed to be told -- that
this was a problem involving a
small minority of people. Most of
Davidson wasn’t like that, in fact
most of Davidson was just as
shocked and saddened by these
events as I was.

I know Jack is right and I
struggle to get things into perspec-
tive, but it is hard. I do feel these
are not “simply” isolated incidents,
however. I think Davidson has
always had a dark side, and I have
seen it before. All you have to dois
go back into Davidson’s history
and you will find evidence. There

starts all over again. Where do
academic pursuits and personal en-
lightenment fit in to such a sched-
ule? Where does good health fitin,
both physical and mental? You
know, you are only young once,
but you can be immature forever.

Say, I have an idea fora theme
party. Let’s have a campus-wide
“Drink Till We Die” party. I’m
afraid (as are many others) that
that is where this is all ‘leading.
There have been several close calls
over the last few years -- I know
because. am always called to help
deal with the media. It seems to me
that if we keep up this pace, sooner
or later someone is going to die.
And that person’s death will be
both stupid and tragic. Is that what
it will take for some sense of re-
sponsibility to creep in?

Don’t get me wrong -- Iam not

messages on other
people’s answering ma-
chines? Am setting myself up for
the same kind of treatment by writ-
ing this piece? Again, I feel hope-
lessly naive somehow, but I can’t
believe this is happening at
Davidson!. Insults and harrass-

ment? Death threats? What the hell
is going on here?!?
And what about The

Davidsonian? In some ways it is
the best I have seen in my ten years
here, for which the editors and
staff should be congratulated. But
in other ways it is mystifying to
me. It is filled with columns that
are too clever by half (I admire
.clever writing, but a little clever-
ness goes a long way, too) and ad
hominem attacks from all quar-
ters. From week to week I pick up
The Davidsonian not to read the

this so, I wonder. Is it a
reflection of the greater
world outside? The world

of Sam Kinison, Andrew

have always been homo-
sexuals on campus.

Let me talk first about alcohol.
I hope I do not come across as
holier than thou, for Iam not inno-
cent. I have been drunk before and
stupid before, some times at the
same time and more times than I
care toadmit. I was lucky, perhaps,
in that I survived my youthful self
and my worst excesses. I grew up
and learned the wisdom of mod-
eration and restraint, and I think I
am none the worse for my tight
ences.

Icame of age in the sixties and
seventies, so] have seen justabout
everything, and one of my room-
mates was, and still is, an alco-
holic. He isalso still my friend and
always will be. But what I have not
seen until recently is an element of
desperation, nihilism and self-de-
struction thataccompany the drink-

age of 21 are among the most
misguided and disastrous laws ever
enacted. I also don’t expect stu-
dents, as a group, to stop drinking,
nor do I think it necessary. And
nothing will stop some students
from occasionally getting drunk.
But a little drunkenness goes a
long way. Why is it necessary to
get drunk night after night or week
after week? Is it an oxymoron or
irresponsible of me to suggest
“drunkenness in moderation” as a
start? Thecollegeisinan extremely
difficult position, both legally and
morally, when it comes to this is-

- sue, and won’t be able to “solve”

the problem from the top down.
Individual students and student
groups are going to have toresolve
this problem somehow, and it had

better happen soon or things could

get ugly.

Dice Clay, NWA, 2 Live
Crew, Willie Horton political ads,
David Duke, etc., etc.,ad nauseam?
Is it simply acceptable in contem-
porary American society to trash
other people viciously when you
dislike them or disapprove of them
or disagree with them? And ifitis,
is that any excuse for the same to
happen at Davidson? We havereal
issues to talk about at Davidson,
but why don’t we just drop all

» attempts atrational, civil discourse

and just start talking about each
others’ mamas?! ?

I don’t understand the streak
of racism that persists or what
motivates the hatred. And I don’t
understand the homophobia that
persists even more strongly, or
perhaps I do alittle bit. Ican under-

eStand if someone is morally op-
posed to homosexuality on Bibli-

cal or other: grounds, as long as _

they obey the injunction to “‘hate.
the sin and love the sinner.” But I
see a lot of evidence of hating the
“sinner,” not to mention fearing
the “sinner.”

I suppose it is a sign of the
times that I feel compelled to re-
veal where I stand on this. I am

‘strictly heterosexual. I have never

had a homosexual encounter and I
never expect to. I have friends,
however, who I know are homo-
sexual and bisexual, and probably
more friends who are but I just
don’t know. And I don’t really
care. I am four-square in favor of
the establishment of a FLAG chap-
ter at Davidson and I’m not afraid
that doing so means that we are
“condoning homosexuality,” what-
ever that means. Who are we to
condone or condemn? Perhaps we
are just condoning people for being
people, in all their infinite diver-
sity? Evidence suggests. that 10
percent of the population is homo- :
sexual, regardless of how or why
they are. The factremains that they
are. Itis reasonable to guess that 10
percent (maybe less, who knows?)
of Davidson is homosexual. Are
we going to condemn them or
support them? Where is our sense
of Christian love and charity?

Finally, a brief footnote --
written a week later, after I have
come to a better equilibrium. I
confess that] probably overreacted,
but I'll blame it on jet lag. I know
that what I witnessed does not
represent Davidson, that it was
blown out of proportion and that
Davidson is no worse, and in factis
far better than most places I know
of. It’s just that my feelings over-
whelmed me and I feel-I have to
stand upand say something. Thank
God, Jack Perry is right to be opti-
mistic and to be proud of a place
like Davidson and (most of) the
people.who inhabit it.

I must add one other thought -
- I have never been entirely com-
fortable with my job title and at
times like these ponder the absurd-
ity of it. I can no more “direct”
college relations than I can jump
over the moon. I have no illusions”
about that. But I came back to
campus after three weeks and saw
“college relations” in a mess, and
part of me thought, okay, you are

.the “director” -- so do something!

But! write this notas the direc-
tor of anything, but as a single
member of this community, a
member who cares deeply and who
is hurt and angered by some of
what he has seen. Icame back from
a life-changing trip, having ‘been
exposed to some of the best things
that Davidson stands for, and at
first all I saw on my return was the
dark side of Davidson, the worst
that Davidson also stands for. °

These are serious issues that
need to be confronted and notswept
under the rug, and now is the time
to confront them. But, for God’s
sake, let us confront them with a

- measure of respect and considera-

tion foreach other as human beings.
You are worth Caen WORE
are all worth it.
