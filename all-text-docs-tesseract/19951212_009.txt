Senior English Aes premier their works for Colloquium Film Festival

By Ep AcLE
Movie Critic

Cannes, New York, Sundance,
Davidson ... Davidson?!? That’s
right, tonight Davidson will join
the ranks of the elite film festivals
held around the globe by showing
eight student-produced films. The
films were made as final projects
for the Senior English Colloquium,
so it should be obvious that plenty
of time and effort went into them.
Here’s a brief listing of the makers
of the films, their titles, and what

each is about.

* The Most Dangerous Game The
one true action/adventure film of
the night, this film by Jeff Kentand
Miller Cary should blow away any
Die Hard. Worth seeing just for El
Jefe’s James Bond-villain imita-
tion.

* Chloe A tale about a man his
obsession with a woman who he

- can never be with, by Matt Foree

and Mark McGuire. This is a
Three-Fisted Monkey Production,
which practically guarantees that
it'll be a quality flick.

* , Chad Ossman’s five-minute
take on the Senior English
Colloquium syllabus wins the prize
for shortest (and most bizarre) title.
* Dating at Davidson A film by
Terry Gordon and Maggie Young
about — you guessed it — dating
at Davidson. Given the title, this,
too, should be a short film.

* Pavement Board A Jack Liv-
ings, Mary Stephens, Adam Knapp

gize to because I think] got the title
wrong). This film was to be about
a young man’s alienation in a tech-

William Faulkner and Eudora
Welty, was. made by Bobby

this warm-hearted tale about one
man’s search for a mutt in today’s
cold, cruel world. Of course it’s
set in Davidson.

Well, that’s it. Hope to see
you in Perkins Auditrium, tonight
at 7:05 p.m. (Why 7:05? It’s
Kuzmo-time, so don’t ask.)

Postcards from the Edge
Students relax in the

land of siestas and sunshine

By Mary C are JALONICK
Traveling Editor

Man, am] going to miss Spain.

After reading Emily
Simmon’s article on her experi-
ence in Germany, I was inspired to
pick up my pen (which, to be hon-
est, hasn’t seen that much action
lately) and fulfill my duties as a
Postcards from the Edge corre-
spondent.

Iactually wasn’t going to write:
this article, for I felt there was no
way I could capture my experience
in under 500 words =~ I could
write for pages about Spanish
people, customs, culture, scenery,
etc.
I was just so interested to read
that the Germans are so orderly,
because this word is not very im-
portant in Spain, especially in
Southern Spain, in Sevilla, where
we live. For the non anal-reten-
tive, Spain is the place to be.

A beer cost less than a Coke,
and wine costs less than beer, which

is available in gas:station vending
machines. Nosmoking signs might
as well be in another language, for
itisn’trare to see someone light up
in a department store or a crowded
bus. Next door to one hospital
across from where I live, doctors
and nurses often relax with a beer
and a cigarette.

The most wonderful thing
about Spain is the afternoon siesta
— the nap enjoyed by the entire
country between 2 and 5 p.m. ev-
ery day. Long (and large) lunches
are the norm, and if you wanttorun

_any_ sort of errand, it’s just;not, .

possible. However, most bars are
open all day — it’s always pos-
sible to get a drink in Spain.

The people (especially in
Sevilla) couldn’t be nicer. Ask
them for directions (in broken
Spanish, of course), and they’ll
take you there. Order a drink, and,
if you’re lucky, they’ll give you
free food. However, it’s always
understood that they are never
wrong.

The weather here is still sunny,
but we can tell that Christmas is
coming because of the tinsel deco-
rating the hooves of ham (oh, so
many hooves of ham) in every
local grocery store windows. Af-
ter becoming assimilated intosuch
a relaxed culture, returning to the
States (not to mention Davidson)
will be 4 shock to the system.

However, it will be so excit- —

ing to return home to my family,
friends, dog, Christmas tree, inter-
esting professors, FACs, Hickory
Hams, and e-mail. We only havea
little time Jeft, though,:and.as we
reflect upon our semester it be-
comes obvious how much we’I1 all
miss this beautiful country.

So Marry Christmas, Feliz
Navidad. Good luck on exams —
we’ll think of you going crazy in
the library. We'll be back there
soon enough — hurrying to meet-
ings and rushing papers to Cham-
bers by 5:00. But for now, it’s time
to live.for the moment. Hasta
luego; see you in January.

College Cooking

Crunch time means munch time

By Jay SHuttz & Ros Kosicki
Chefs-in-Residence

We realize that with exams
quickly approaching, you willhave
minimal time to cook meals. There-
fore, for our final article of the
semester, we are going to provide
our top 11 (because wejustcouldn’t
stop at 10) quickie meals for exam
week:

1. Kraft Cheese and Macaroni.
Sometimes it’s the simple things
in life that are so good. At 79¢ for
two boxes, it just can’t be beat.
Boil some water, cook the maca-
roni, add cheese. Instant sreriicee
tion.

2. Little Charlie’s Pizza If you
haven’t already discovered this
divine creation, look in the frozen
food section of the Union Café. If
you want a nice crispy crust, place
it in the oven at 350° F for 10 to 15
minutes. If pressed for time, zap it
in the microwave for three.

3. Pasta. The possibilities are end-
less. Be creative.

4. Ramen Noodles, If the funds are
dwindling at the end of the semes-
ter, this is the meal for you. It’s

best served in-the wee hours of the
morning.

5. Brueger’s Bagel Shop. Why not
— it’s new.

6. Sandwich Maker. If you don’t
have one, get one. It makes the
ultimate Fluffer Nutter (this would
be a peanut butter and marshmal-
low fluff sandwich). Don’t knock
it till you try it. ~
7.Campbell’s Chunky Soup. What
can we say — it’s the soup that eats
like a meal.

8. Hungry Man TV Dinners.
They’re making a comeback.

9. Eggs. Scramble three eggs in a
pan and add salsa and cheddar
cheese. I really think the Outpost
should consider adding this recipe
to their scant menu.

10. Oven-roasted chicken. Walk
inside Harris Teeter and hang a
right. There you will see precooked
oven-roasted chickens. Why do
the cooking if someone has al-
ready done it for you? Premade
salads are also available towards
the back of the fruits and vegetable
section of Harris Teeter if you want
to complete the ultimate meal for
slackers who are to lazy to do their

owncooking, or simply don’t have
the time.
11. Cereal. Milkis optional. Many
varieties are just as good straight
from the box. Keep a box handy
while typing up that last term pa-
per. :
Over Christmas break you can
dazzle your parents with all the
great new recipes we have pro-
vided you with this semester. Go
ahead, take all the credit; we don’t
mind ... See you in ‘96.
