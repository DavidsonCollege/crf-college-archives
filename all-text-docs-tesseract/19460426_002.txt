WCU

ISverybody is tired of hearing about the
spirit of Davidson when there is none in
evidence. Is the Davidson spirit a ghost?
It does not take a man with rare intellect
to see that the old spirit as proclaimed in
Chambers and as practiced are two entirely
different things... In chapel as most of you
have noticed there have been a series of
talks dealing with the Davidson: spirit and
tradition.

SCHOOL SPIRIT IS NOT BUILT ON
MORAL VICTORIES

Who wants to hear about moral victor-
ies anyway? Davidson teams used to get
out on the field and make the opposing team
feel that they were fighting against drive
and spirit. We are tired of moral viétories.
We want victories.

The players on the teams have come out
at the first of the season enthusiastic and
ready for a scrap, but after a few games
in which the*student body shows little in-
terest by not attending the games there is
a lag of interest in the players, imper=
ceptible at first, but which tends to under-
mine the will to give that lastef fort in order
to win. It has been proved over and over

again. These moral victories have been won

in the past usually with much larger.schools|

and stiff composition, but even those moral
“victories” lost their flavor after a time,
There are nostalgic memories of some
of the older boys about the times when the
freshmen were not so cowed. Someone was
given a free ride in chapel everyday. Now
the freshmen leave chapel withthe seniors.
Times charge but surely not that much.

changes. Too with the recent victories of

the tennis and track teams more spirit is

lin evidence.

Spirit goes on the field and it has always
heen perpetuated not by boys hired for

athletics, but those who came and fought

i for their Alma Mater, Davidson with all

they. had.
What can be done about? "Plenty. Go
to the games and yell as though your life?

depended on winning the game. Make it a

| habit to attend all activities, speak on the

campus, raise some heck, give out with
some more names like Dandy Jim the Monk,
Dopey. Believe it or not all of this creates
spirit and a feeling of unity among the
student body.

Let's wake up—SPIRIT—and tight!

After The Church?

Rumor has it that not too far in the
distant future we may expect to have a
student activities building on the campus.
With building conditions such as they
are now, there is little that we can da
other than to express opinions as to just
what kind of building we should like to
see at Davidson for this purpose.

In connection with this I should like
to describe The Student Activities Build-
ing at The Virgina Polytechnic Institute
in hopes that possibly we may get some-
thing similar to it. Of course Davidson
would-not need anything quite so large
as is necessary for VPI and it’s .two or
three thousand students, but a building
somewhat on a smaller scale would, in
my opinion, be ideal.

The “SAB”, as it is called at VPI,
has a basement, a first, and a second
floor. The basement is devoted to such
enterprises as a bookstore, a soda foun-
tain, a grill, post office, and a men’s cloth-

_ ing shop. All of these, with the possible
exception of the clothing store, should be
included here at Davidson.

On the first or ground floor are the
facilities for the student social affairs
such as several spacious lounges, a ball
room, and a banquet hall. It would hardly
be necessary for us to have a separate
ball room “and banquet hall; instead one
of the two rooms could be used as a
cafeteria. The combined ball réom and
banquet hall would certainly be the an-
“‘SWer to small social functions and frat-
ernity dinner dances.

Student organizations occupy the -
second floor. One side is used by the YM-
CA for offices and reception rooms. The
rest is taken up with offices for student
publications, student government, and
honorary fraternities. I am rather of the -
opinion that a centralization such as this
of student organizations here at David-
son would be much better than having
them scatteredall over the campus as we
do now.

When plans are drawn‘up for such a
building as this, I feel sure that the ad-
ministration can’t -go wrong, if they de-
cide upon something similar to the “SAB”
at VPI. Anyone in the student body who
has seen it, will, I’m sure agree with me.

All the fellows are securing dates
for the spring dances and are look-
ing forward to the event with a
great deal of enthusiasm. It will
be the last college dance for some
of the fellows who are seniors and
for others who are going into the
army.

We are in hopes we will have
the house fixed in time for the
dances, but Buddy Carson will have
to crack the whip hard in order to
accelerate the pace of his helpers.
All kidding aside, Buddy, you are
doing a fine job and we all know
it’s going to look good when you
get through. Bob Strickland has
been up to New York to see his

“SUCH LOVELINESS NEVER UNTOUCHED” —

By Frank Barr, Jr.

Since copies of this issue will un-
doubtedly fall into the hands of our
visitors this week-end, I have been
asked to make the following plea:
“Please don't laugh at the fraternity
house lawns. We really expect grass
to grow.” I was also asked to post
this ‘notice: PLEASE KEEP OFF
THE GRASS.

Something which has been lack-
ing on dance week-ends is a place
for the independent boys to enter-
tain their dates. At last we have
devised a plan. The fraternities ar:
holding open house this week-end.
In «Addition, refreshments will be
served at the Guest House.

More problems must be faced next
year when dances are held on the
campus. With an increased student
body, there will be even less room
on the dance floor as well as less

room for housing les femmes. What

will the answer be?

The Davidsonian staff has several
solutions to offer for this problem.

surplus shelter-halves and erect a

P.S. Dear Anonymous, | hope you
got a date.

This is the column you want to
show your Spring Frolics date, fel-
lows. Don’t try’ to hide this from
her. Let-her see your name-in big
bold letters. Come on BILL POL-
LARD, she's going to find out a-
bout that late date in. Mooresville,
anyhow. What does she care, her
picture’s in the paper.

Up until Monday afternoon
FRANK BARR was still trying to
think of some way to break that
awful date he was coerced into, and
latch on to his true love at Queens
(our sister school, , . you know, the
place where the Charlotte girls go
when they can’t be a social success
at Agnes Scott. Thank you Atlanta).

Many of the local lads are making
quite a name for themselves in Char-
lotte social circles’ BILL ‘JITTER-

usual crowd of bobby soxers at the
Stan Kentén brawl. The same crowd
is known to yearn and squeal for
autographed photos of BITSY
ARCHER, the traveling salesman.
And fame.is spreading for another
of the more prominent campus cha-
acters. Who is. this man, praised as
a user of Agnoter, and rescued from
his life of sin by a rescue mission
of New York's Bowery?

Whispered rumors have floated
around the campus of late, and hung
suspended near the bushes of Geor-
gia: At last they can be confirmed!
It's true! THE HAT (name it, you

But when on-earth you did appear,

You were an unkown two in a new

Now he traveled far and wide;
The earth was at his feet,
He always fought

And gained the triumphant's seat.

He loved you dear, without a fear,

And by God, of most men, sincere;

But he could not stay the avenger’s
