Thanksgiving---Resuli
Of The American System

The frontiersman’s dream of a land

of plenty from sea to sea is no longer

@ mere vision in America.

The dreams of past generations
are the realities of today. And so the
hopes of today will be the order for
tomorrow.

The abundance that is America's
—the abundance of food. and homes.
and thriving communities. as well as
a spirit of hope for the future is the
symbol of this prosperous and fertile
land.

As Thanksgiving Day approaches,
it is reassuring to reflect on this pros-
perity and this progress that flows
across our land.

Despite Russia's ‘sputniks.” the
missile race, inflation. race tensions,
the threat of war and all the other
problems that plague the world. we’
in America this Thanksgiving can in
truth be thankful for all that is ours.
The abundance of good things is
everywhere around us.

But what is the driving force be-
hind this prosperity? What is the
spirit that accounts for America’s
plenty?

It is the American tradition—the
free expression of free men. This is
the tradition of initiative, imagina-
tion, the ability to organize, the ‘state
of the industrial arts, dnd the freedom
to develop one’s talents.

In the words of a great Davidson
professor, it is the system of ‘freedom

for the individual, private property,
and the competitive principle as the
best means of achieving a _ good
life

To another great man the Ameri-
can System “is the product of our
race and of our experience in build-
ing a nation to heights unparalleled in
the whole history of the world. It is
a system peculiar to the American
people. It differs essentially from all
others in the world.”

Hand in hand with this doctrine of
true liberalism are the institutions of
family and church. Lest one think
that the fruits of America are the re-
sults of purely economic factors and
the lust for material accumulation.
let us remember that the fabric of
America is woven ‘by many forces,
not the least of which is religion.

A deep belief in the Creator and
a conviction for ‘the teachings of
Christ’ are perhaps the strongest
threads in this fabric. The Ten Com-
mandments and the Sermon on the
Mount have been the _ traditional
spiritual force that directs the Ameri-
can nation.

Therefore, at this three hundred
and thirty-first Thanksgiving, the
problem of the free world is to find
some way to keep all of this from
being torn asunder. For as Wendell
Wilkie said, ‘‘no man knows, once it
is destroyed. where or when man will
find its protective warmth again.”

Wake Forest's
Bunny Hopping

Yesterday's Charlotte Observer
carried a four column photo of Wake
Forest students doing the “Bunny
Hop” in protest of the Baptist State
Convention’s overwhelming vote to
continue the ban against campus danc-
ing.

Anyone who has seen the all new,
multi-million dollar Wake Forest cam-
pus cannot help but smile at the con-
trast between the new buildings and
the anachronistic social laws.

Despite any legal social restraints.
however. we have a sneaking sus-
picion that the Wake Forest students
will keep right on dancing—off-cam-
pus, of course.

And it might not be the “bunny
hop.”

Recall Election
At Chapel Hill

It is becoming almost a habit at
Chapel Hill to threaten the editor of
The Daily Tar Heel with a “recall
election.”

For the second time in three years,
the student editor of the college pa-
per has taken a strong stand against
football coach Jim Tatum and his,
“professional” football. Both times the
students have answered back with the
recall election.

The University of North Carolina
has always been noted for a tradition
of enlightened liberalism. If this
democratic spirit still prevails, there
is little doubt that students will give
their editor an overwhelming vote
of confidence in the recall election.

The DAVIDSONIAN offers its mor-
al support to editor Bass of Chapel
Hill. We respect The Daily Tar Heel
as one of the foremost college papers
in the country.

Using the University paper as an
example, we must not forget that the

only obligation that any newspaper
has to its readers is to print the news
with fairness and accuracy The Daily
Tar Heel has done this.

On ‘the other hand, the editorial
page—by right — should reflect the
sincere convictions of the editor. This
is the one place that he can‘say exact-
ly what he thinks. A good editorial
will not embrace the wishy-washy
policy of echoing only the popular
issues.

As it looks from here, the only
legitimate charge against the editor
of The Daily Tar Heel seems to be that
he said what he thought.

Thanks For

Preparations

Freshmen entering the gymnasium
on Friday night for their first college
dance will wonder at the metamor-
phosis that has taken place.

Mentally, if not vocally, they will
observe that “we never realized that
the gym could look so good.” The
decorations will relegate to a minor
position in the mind the many weary
P.T. classes held on the same spot.

The Interfraternity Council, un-
der the leadership of Bob Jones, has
spent many hours in planning this
dance. Furthermore, this council has
worked hard to insure a more eco-
nomical weekend.

In addition, expressions of grati-
tude should be given to Jimmy Jones
for his task as head of the decorations
committee. Last month this group
was in the final stages of its work
only to be told that there would be
no dance.

Using whatever materials they
could from those left over from the
“first Homecoming,” this committee
again set out to decorate the gym.

Thanks are due also to Mrs. Boyce
Moore and all of those who assisted
her in the sometimes tedious task of
providing rooms for the girls when
they arrive. It is a unique privilege
to have a dormitory prepared to wel-
come to the dates.—G.L.W.

Q Boy, What Fun!

By ANDY BLAKE

Int new here, Class of. Sixty-
gne you know, I'm just a’ bit
excited. about my first dance
weekend: from what I've heard
it. should be about the most fun
that thas éver descended upon
my young life. I’ve had a few
problems getting ready for the
big affair, but everything is
straight now arid nothing could
go wrong: this late (It’s Thurs-
*day night).

HOMECOMING

t had a date with the prettiest
girl in my hometown in Arkan-
sas for what was to have been
Homecoming Weekend. When
the influenza epidemic became
bad enough to cancel the
weekend’s events, I wrote her
a letter, but her plane had al-
ready left when the letter ar-
rived.

I wasn't expecting her, there-
fore no one met her at the air-
port: I don’t know how she
managed to reach Davidson. I
think she was rather disappoint-
ed to learn that the dances had

been called off. I had flu and’

didn’t get to see her much, but
I was able to get a professor
to keep her for the weekend
(she couldn't stay in Belk, of
course.)

Everything would have becu
just fme, but she caught flu
and missed her plane home. She
couldn't get a later plane. but
luckily we got bus reservations
for her trip back to Arkansas.
She’s not going to be able to
come back for this weekend.

When ! found out she
couldn’t come | was pretty
miserable, because | don’t
know very many girls. At
this low ebb in my existence
my big brother rescued
me, You see, he is pinned,
and his girl is a freshman
hall counsetor at a college
not far from here. There's
e girl on her hall who
doesn’t have a date, and
she’s supposed to be very
cute, with a good personali-
ty and all the girls like her.
| believe that she'll be a
wonderful date.

For a while I was afraid some-
thing might go wrong again,
but [I'm sure. nothing will hap-
pen this late. This, is my first
college dance (1 believe I said
that), and I’m very happy about
it. I hope my tuxedo will fit.
“What? Oh good, it's probably
from home.”

Excuse me, I have. a long dis-
tance telephone call.

COFFEE BREAK

Adam, Eve:

Schopenhauer

By BOB JONES

Being a dance weekend per-
haps it would be well to report
the conclusions of a recent cof-
fee break which dealt with co-
eds, dates, sex, sin, ete.—slight.
ly edited of course.

COMMON DILEMMA

The common dilemma, _ it
seems, in the dating world is
that those whom you would like
to date don’t want to date you,
whereas those who want to date
you, you don't want to date.

In addition, those whom you
would like to date, are those
who are impossible to arrange
a date with. This, it was decided,
narrows the field of compatible
dates considerably.

Further, it seems that among
coilege males it is rather com-
mon to take a somewhat Scho-
penhauerian view of the college
female.

HAVE GUN

When one: spends an entire
evening discussing trivia anil
the unfortunate love troubles of
some mutual friend, it often
comes nostalgically to mind that
perhaps the o!d Saturday night
TV club isn't so bad After all
—wwhat. girl can match one cool
evening of Paladin in “Have
Gun, will Travel?”

But then, after one Saturday
evening of faithful attendance
in the club, followed by the
rather exotic details of the es-
capades of a. more widely

traveled brother, one stops to
consider that maybe there's
more to this dating angle than
meets the eye.

ADAM & EVE

After all, it’s been going on
ever since Adam and Eve (that's
not eating apples, brother) and
seems pretty well established
by now. And in the final analy-
sis who's to be a non-conformist
at Davidson?

So off again to a new girl's
school the next weekend. Being
a higher class school, we find
more personality and _ intelli.
gence with the trivia—but trivia
nontheless. There's a new pair
to feel sympathy for because
of their all too tragic love trou-
bles, but how nice it would be
to be watching Paladin with the
brothers.

SCHOPENHAUER

For one must realize. as Scho-
penhauer so candidly pointed
out, all this is but the expres.
sion of the terrible will to five,
and with true collegiate pes-
simism we know life is not
worth living.

But for the time being (being
this is the time for being a
time-maker) may the loyal cof-
fee breakers and TVers relax
all skeptical inhibitions for the
duration of the gala Homecom.
ing (flu-ized) weekend. For al-
though life isn’t worth living,
it’s only lived once!

Senior, Frosh Look Forward to Dance Weekend

Don't Bother, Son

BY A SENIOR

Call it weekend satiety. call
it impotency, call it creeping
middle age at twenty-one, In
fact. anything you like, but I’m
sick and tired of dance week-
ends.

PINS & PERFUME

For longer years than.I like
to remember, I've dutifully
moved out of my pleasant abode
in the depths of Belk dorm and
with very little profanity made
my nest in the corner of some
Freshman's room, right there
with the dirty shorts and spilt
shoe polish. And I have moved
back to bobby pins in my bed,
perfume in the medicine cabi-
net, and on special weekends,
female attire left in my sock
drawer.

This thrice yearly trek
t have made so that my
friends and classmates, and
| suppose myself, could en-
joy the pleasures of female
company fer a weekend. It’s
not at all clear to me just
why 1 go through with this
so often, but with the herd
1 live, so with the herd |
join frantically in two days
of idol worship for the ID.

With these things in mind,
I look forward a bit apprehen-
sively to the weekend at hand.
I've got a date, I think (bitter
experience in the past has
taught me not to be too dog-
matic on this issue), and if she
arrives, the usual living breath-
ing southern drawling female
thing that comes at times like
this, I plan to do the things that
are always done.

We will stand in line at the

boarding house for cold ham
and a smile from the housé
mother. We'll go to the dance,
arriving late so as not to get
there when the freshmen do,
we'll find the music totally un-
danceable.

Later in the evening she'lt
surmise that we ought to find
some nice quiet place to talk
“away from all this noise.” Still
later, trembling lips wilt no
doubt ask me what I plan to
do when I graduate. With one
hand on my pin and the other
on my poeket book, Pll either
kiss the lips to quiet them, or
if she seems to be the really
serious type, I'll yawn and com.
ment on the late hour.

On Sunday, | hope to cop
the fraternity prize for get.
ting rid of my date at the
earliest hour (An award that
) heve won for the past
three dance weekends).

On Sunday afternoon I'll have
a pledge move me back to Belk,
and late that night I'll lay snug-
ly in my bed, content in the
fact that the thing can only
happen a couple more times to
me.

STARRY-EYED

I certainly wish the very best
to the freshmen for whom this
will be a new experience, and
also to the starry-eyed ones
among us who are _ in ° love,
These times are made for peo. .
ple like that. But for me. the
weekend will be a success if
I keep my pin, don’t spill any-
thing on my tuck, and get eight
hours sleep both nights.

MOTTOES REQUESTED

By PHIL LEWIS

Tom Watts has been livening up the atmosphere in
the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Room right across from
the single room in East Dorm. It seems that he has doubts
as to the good aims of those who enter, and he has placed
several signs about enjoining a straightforward approach.

MOTTO

Speaking of signs, someone left a printed placard in
our room the other evening warning “WHEN IN DOUBT,

DON'T!” Anyone else caring to contribute other sugges-
tions for. mottos using this basic principle, please give |

them to us, and we'll attempt to get them printed in the

near future.

We'd like to avail ourselves of the opportunity of
speaking to the girls down here for the dances, and ex-
tend a hearty welcome to both of you. Sorry so many of
the boys had to be away at the Duke-Carolina Game and
such, but Bob Jones and the Interfraternity Council are
to be congratulated on their planning and execution of

this project.

MODERATION

Since we're in such a congratulatory mood, we'd
like to congratulate John Trask on his splendid editorial
of last week. In a time when excitable tempers and obvious
bigotry are the order of the day, it’s wonderful to hear
the voice of moderation and toleration above the din.

When in doubt...

Baptist: NO College Dancing — The delegates to
Baptist State Convention reaffirmed a ban on dancing

at Wake Forest and Meredith Colleges. Spokesmen for
the Trustees of the two colleges argued quietly and earn-
estly that dancing was an accepted social activity. The op-
posing ministers pictured it a simple moral issue.
