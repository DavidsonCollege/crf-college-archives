Charlotte

The many friends of Mr. James
Holmes Carson, "16, will be interested to
learn that he has decided to locate in
Charlotte.
in the Anderson Motor Sales Company.

“Mr. Carson.” says the Charlotte
Observer, “is ene of the city’s leading
young men. After graduating from Da-
vidson, Mr, Carson entered the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania, from which he soon
graduated. Leaving college he entered
the service of his country, received his
cemmission of first lieutenant and was
later promoted to captain.”

H. B. Fraser, '17, was on the Hill
last Saturday. He will resume his
studies at Union Theological Seminary,
which opens today. In a few remarks
made before the Eumenean Literary So-
ciety Saturday night, Mr. Fraser said
that he was glad to be back on the cam-
pus again, and to see the progress being
made by the college. He said a few
familiar faces made Davidson seem like
home to him.

Then the “best yet’ happened. Mr.
A. L. Currie in reporting the decision
of a committee on how to get new mem-
bers, suggested the plan of having a giant
feed in the new gymnasium next Satur-
day night instead of regular debate. All
the new men (whether entering as,
Freshmen or otherwise) from North
Carolina were to be invited. This plan
was accepted and carried by storm. It -
was decided to have a committee to look
up each new man here and give him a
personal invitation. Admission will be
on recognition only, Also it was later
decided to have all the officers of our
sister society. They also will* be in-
vited.
