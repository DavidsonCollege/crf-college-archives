College may end year with a deficit for first time

By SUZANNE CRAYMER

For the first time ever, Davidson
could face a budget deficit for the 1989-
90 school year. Three factors have been
sighted for the financial shortage—
lower student enrollment, the opening
of the Baker Sports Complex and theex-
penses caused by Hugo. In a memo to
all college employees, President ‘John
Kuykendall stated: “Initial estimates
indicated that there would be a signifi-
cant shortfall for this fiseal year.”

Because of the shortage, Kuykendall
asked faculty, staff and adminstrators
to review their budgets and eliminate
any expenditures which could be de-
ferred. In addition, Kuykendall stipu- .
lated that-“no additional personnel,
including replacements, will be added
to the payroll without advance ap-
proval.”. Employees must also secure

The possibility ofa budget deficit has
existed for several years. Kuykendall
wrote, “we have seen our budget situ-

ation get ‘progressively “asetae during
the past several years.”

This year several unexpected events
occurred which caused additional ex-
penses.. “None were really budget-
breaking events,” said Robert Sutton,
Vice President for Business and Fi-
nance. “But all of them taken together
affected the budget in a negative way.”

One factor is the Baker Sports Com-
plex. Interim Athletic Director Sterling
Martin said that the complex was “in-
significant in the overall picture.”

The complex. went over budget be-
cause several factors which were cutout
of the original budget had to be rein-
serted. Themoney for details, including
a second side of bleachers, came from
the construction budget. Thus the con-
struction budget could no longer ac-
commodate equipment, office furniture
and staff.

Baker Sports Complex will be less than
$100,000 over budget. .

The war against geo-
graphical illiteracy has
taken an interesting turn.
The Dean Rusk Program in
International Studies has
overseen the installation of
world maps in approxi-
mately 150 dormitory bath-
room stalls and on each of
the 36 senior apartment

doors. fe
The coordinator of the
project, senior Mary Snyder,
said the idea was conceived
during a Dean Rusk Pro-
gram meeting in response to
the surveys completed by
freshmen in the Fall. Ac-
~ cording to Snyder, “We're
not saying Davidson stu-
dents don’t know geogra-

phy, but we think this will
help people increase what-
ever knowledge they do
have.” Approximately 14
students collaborated on the
project.

This combination of geo-
graphical awareness and
universal free time has re-
ceived national attention
through the AP press and
individual papers. Snyder
has received letters from all
over the country, including
California. No committees
have been formed to con-
tinue the project, but Snyder
hopes there will be enough
interested people to ensure
that the effort to increase
“geographical and cultural

-awareness” will continue.

year. “For once, the athletic department
is doing a very good job managing the
budget, and we hope to come under
budget,” said Martin, “but we might
have to eat our words by the end of the
year.”

The athletic department received
only a. small budget increase in operat-
ing expenses even though Baker Sports
Complex is significantly larger than
Johnston. Martin stressed the choices
which the athletic department has
made in terms of office furniture and
staff.

One of these choices included limit-
ing the hours the building is open, and
piecing together furnishings. Martin
said, “The bottom line is that we must
come to grips that we must make some
hard choices. We may have to cut out
some things.”

budget includes the shortage of
students due to programs overseas. The
budget assumed that 1,400 students
would be enrolled in Davidson. How-

_ ever, only 1,356 are paying tuition this

year. When a student leaves Davidson

factor which influenced the

on an off-campus program, that tuition
is diverted from the budget. Several
programs which began in the spring
have played a large role in taking stu-
dents off campus.

“We are just now trying to manage
the enrollment,” said Robert Gardner,
Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid.
“It has previously not factored in, but if
you’re going to have tight budgets,
everything must be accounted for.
We've discovered what the issues are,
and now we’re straightening them
out.”

The college encountered a serious
cost in cleaning up after Hurricane
Hugo. The hurricane destroyed well
over 200 trees and damaged several
buildings. “Hugo could cost the college

a couple hundred thousand dollars”
said Sutton. “It’s a significant cost.”

Until. the college begins. receiving
money from the Campaign for
Davidson, the budget problem will
persist. “We must operate in a lean and
efficient manner until the Campaign for
Davidson money starts flowing in,”
said Sutton.
