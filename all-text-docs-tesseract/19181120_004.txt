The above chart is self-explanatory.| sergeant would have issued delinquencies

The names on the left were those of the
men on the canvassing teams with their
respective team and company leaders.
The whole scheme was Mr. Moore's,
our Army Y. M. C. A. secretary, and
the resulting success is well shown by the
amounts raised by each company and by
the college. The results are shown to
the extreme right, the grand total ex-
ceeding $7,000. As returns were brought
to headquarters each space was checked
off on the chart. It can well be ‘seen
that the estimates were far exceeded,
running over into the last columns. The
chart is rather untidy, but it is interest-
ing to note just how results were tabu-
lated during the intense rivalry — last
Wednesday night, ‘The makers of the
chart were rather flabergasted as the
results began to run all out of bounds.

“PEACE, PEACE”—WHEN
THERE 18 NO PEACE

Monday before last, while the S. A.
T.C. (soldiers at the college) men were
waiting for Bitzer, the bugler, to sound
his imperative notes for assembly, the
news of peace was heard. Everybody
thought it a “uniform story" until Pri-
vate Britt corroborated the report by
holding up a Charlotte Observer, across
which was printed in letters as big as
our Boy Scouts feel, the word ‘ Peace.”
Of course everybody was disappointed
because they were deprived of a chance
of putting into practice their training in
“bayonet killing,” or of secing how close
they could get to a German shell without
getting hit, but when they thought of
playing leap-frog over the German
trenches they forgot their disappoint-
ment and exulted so vociferously that the
exquisitely produced notes from Bitzer’s
bugle were hardly audible.

Everybody was so anxious to get de-

tails from Private Britt that it was al-

most impossible for anyone to stand at
attention during revielle. Having found
out that the world had peace. nobody
here could be at peace for hollering
peace. Cleaning up for room inspection
was so subordinated that had not the in-
spector been a most considerate human
being of the most indulgent nature, the

with surprising generosity.

After breakfast (niess) the men. be-
gan to think over a fit celebration, and
rapidly concluded that a-holiday was the
most fit, because it fitted the desires bet-
ter than any other possible celebration.
The method used for obtaining the holi-
day was a rather infantile procedure.
We hollored for it. Nobody gets what
they -holler for except the baby, and we
are the baby in Uncle Sam’s army, so we
got it. Promises of uniforms or real
guns to play with couldn't appease, so
they said anything to please the baby.
Someone has ascribed the fortune to the
yells given in frone of Ruample, and if
that he the efficacy, the would-be-Sophs
will not be offended by the indignity
committed upon their reputation by such
unseemly yells,

The first class had already begun
when Bitzer sounded a behest to assem-
ble, and the professors were soon atone,
and relieved of the burden of securing
the attention of the class. Lieutenant
Dennard hurried with his announcement
so that the auditors would procced to
breathe. and when he said that it was to
be a holiday, there was such an ebulition
of joy that Liston woke up, Charlie Hall
made a rush for cough drops, Red Smith
was animated and grew frantic, the Pre-
Mcd. students deemed it wise to repair
to the woods to escape harmful effects
on the ear drums, the bug class tried to
head off the fleeing, frightened grass-
hoppers, and General Hall was moved
to flights of oratory.

But it all culminated in a beautiful
spirit. About 10 o'clock the companies
marched down to the church for a
thanksgiving service. It was a simple
service, and everybody in perfect sub-
mission gave thanks and ascribed the
glory to the Heavenly Father. It was
a spirit that evinced the truest American
patriotism, and brotherhood, and that
marks a Christian nation.

RUMORS € ONCERNING
THE END OF §. A. T. C.

“O boy! we are leaving here soon,
Charlotte Observer savs §. A. T. C. will
be mustered out immediately.” Such are

the exclamations frequently heard on the
campus. However, from the present in-
dications these rumors are without foun-
dation. Despite the fact that the United
States is at peace with the world, the S.

. TC. will in all probability continue.

The government has a contract with
the college, lasting until June 21, 1919.
and at present shows no intention of
breaking this contract. A communica:
