Slade Signed By Richmond:
Colts Offer Him J ob In’71

Assistant Sports Editor

Down but not out. That
old cliche well describes the
struggléS of last year’s
Southern Conference  foot-
ball Player of the Year,
Gordon Slade, to make an
NEL team.

The former Davidson
standout was picked in the
annual college craft last

Colts. He spent the summer
in training camp with them.

“Training camp was not as
physically tiring as ~* you
might think,’ said Slade.
“But mentally it was really

The Colts kept him on their

When asked the most in-.

teresting event he ever cov-
ered, Strong recalled both,
his trip to the Pop Festival
at Love Valley last July and
his interview with Lieuten-
and Governor Pat Taylor.
“Taylor handled himself
quite well, and was interest-
ing and_ informative,’ he
said ‘‘and it was one of the
best interviews I did.”

The news department of a
station such as WBTV is a
large complex machine of
reporters, editors, rewriters,
secretaries and all the pa-
rephenalia of any large in-
dustry. From this group
Strong commented particu-

larly on the fine abilities of

In the meantime, the
Colts Have already invited
Slade to their 1971. training
camp after he has had «a
years’ experience in the ACL
and he is in contact with
other NFL clubs. In addi-
tion, Richmond is a “ farm

club" of the New Orleans
Saints.
Slade was a two-sport

standout at ‘Davidson, play-
ing the outfield well enough
to make the all-conference

Wildcat gridders and their
new head coach, Dave Fagg.
“I thought the team looked
real good,’ he remarked.
“They took advantage — of
Richmond's mistakes and
