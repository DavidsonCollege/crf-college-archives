KA’s falter:

Hello peons! We are glad to
see that you have finally hopped
on the Bad Bernard and Bone-
head Baridwagon. Last week’s
column was excellent and our
ratings have sky-rocketed.
Several of our groupies have
made requests for more gore
and violence in our article, but.
we feel that there is a need for
good family-oriented writing, so
get out of here. ”

The 1978 Davidson Flicker-
ball Championship game was
played yesterday on Richardson
Field {the one behind the li-
brary). This was the first year
that an IMAC game has been
played on the Silver Fox’s
hurting grounds, but it was
necessary because several con-
ditions made it impossible to
have the game on the conven-
tional fields:

Field One was worn out where
the KA’s had spent hours of
practice; on Field Two a search
was being continued for a young
PiKA athlete lost in the bushes
eight weeks ago (later found in
the library); and ~Field_Three
was too slick after Butch, Bilbo, _
and Rebel ate at Slater.

The championship game saw
SAE matched against Mac-
Fleet, a team that barely lost to
the E’s earlier in the double
elimination tournament. The

_climination tournament. the _ = MACFLEE

since just one loss could elimi-
nate any chance for the title; to
win, they had to beat the E’s
twice in a row. -
The pressure ~ on each team
reached close to 3.6 torr and the
tension was ninety-eight new-
tons as the young joules lined
up for the singing of the
national anthem. =~ ~~

Cagers delight fans

Davidson basketball fans
were treated to a pre-season
look at the Wildcat team which
held its Red-White inter-squad
scrimmage at Park Center in
Charlotte last Saturday.

John Gerdy led the winning
White team with 32 points as
they defeated the Red team
89-80. Senior Pat Hickert and
Rich DiBenedetto added 19 and
17 points respectively for the
winners,

High-scorer on the White
squad was 67” Todd Haynes
who played aggressive basket-
ball around the basket and
picked up 34 points. Freshman
Brian Rowan hit for 19 points
while fellow freshman Jamie
Hall poured in 14 in the losing
effort.

Coach Eddie Biedenbach was
pleased with the team’s shoot-
ing, but noted several areas

where improvement was still
needed. ‘“‘The tempo was’ not
like that of a team who will be
playing N.C. State, Duke,
Notre Dame and going for the
Southern Conference Champi-
onshp.”’

Biedenbach conceeded that
the problem of keeping a fast
tempo going will become easier
as the team continues to im-
prove its stamina and strength.
Apart from the physical condi-
tion of the players, Biedenbach
-was pleased with the mental
aspect. “The attitude (of the
team) is conducive to having a
good season.”

The fans who saw the scrim-
mage came away encouraged.
The confidence of the coaching
staff and the players has begun
to slowly exude to the students
as they anticipate a brand of
competitive basketball which
will be fast-pace, exciting, and
fun to watch.

championship. A replay of the!

but were crushed by KA Gold in
a big league game.

The sun hung low over the

Southern Gentlemen were re-

Rosie, we stunk. The KA team
had previously lost a tough one
to SAE 13-12.

In the battle of the minor sex,

were never scored on all year
and it is a vow that they have
promised to keep throughout
their stay at Davidson.

That's all for this week. Hello
blimps! Three on three basket-
ball rosters due tomorrow. Kiss

Later.
