With New Recruits, McKillop Optimistic About Team

By MATT JOHNES

With the loss of a slew of sen-
iors from a basketball squad that
finished 4-24 last year, the ‘90-91
season may appear dismal. Add to
that a schedule that includes St.
John and Atlantic Coast Confer-
ence powerhouses Wake Forest,
Duke and Virginia, and the season
might look like a long one.

Butdon’tdismiss the Wildcats
this year, as Dick Vitale has; he has
predicated Davidson to finish in
lastplace. Second year coach Bob
McKillop, after a successful ca-
reer at Long Island Lutheran High

School in New York, has recruited
a talented freshmen class. Couple
this witha host of experienced vet-
erans and program has teason to be
optimistic. In this interview with
the Davidsonian, McKillop talks
of his expectations for the season,
assesses the impact of the new-
comers, evaluates the competition
and expresses his joy at the Wild-
cats’ affiliation with the Big South
Conference.

Davidsonian: Dick Vitale picked
Davidson to finish last in the Big
South conference. What is your
reaction to this?

McKillop: Obviously, it presents

some motivation for our bulletin
board. I think it’s indicative of
what we’ ve done in the past couple
of years, our lack of success. Italso
perhaps reflects the fact that we'll
be relying a lot on freshman youth
and inexperience.

Davidsonian: What do you think}
the impact of this year’s recruiting
class will be?

McKillop: We will see very early,
because they are going to get the
opportunity to play early in the
season. I’ve been delighted with
what I’ve seen in the preseason.
We have a lot more weapons this
year than we did last year, and they
are going tohavea very significant
impact on us. They are going to be
the core our our program for the
next three years.

Davidsonian: What teams will be

contenders for the conference title?
McKillop: . Coastal Carolina, in
all the publications, is the favorite.
After that, there is no one team that
stands out as being far superior to
others. Coastal Carolina is the out
and out favorite; I think they stand
head and shoulders above every-
one else. I don’t believe there will
be that much of a difference be-
tween the second and third place
team and the seventh and eighth
place team.
Davidsonian: Who will fill the
point guard slot left open by the
graduation of Alan Hunter?
McKillop: There are three guys
whoare going to be seeing playing
time at that spot: Pat Holloway and
Jason Zimmerman, whoare fresh-
man, and Paul Denmond, a junior.
At this point, it looks like Pat is the
odds on favorite to get that posi-
tion this year.
Davidsonian: Who do you see as
the starting five this year?
McKillop: I can’t project-that at
this point. There is no doubt that
Detlef Musch willbe starting atthe
center spot. He’s gota lot of expe-
rience, he’s improved his strength,
and he’s improving each andevery
day. Detlef’s best years are still

ahead of him. Paul Denmond is the
guy were going to go to for one of
the guard spots, so I think Pat and
Paul you can pencil in as guards,
but after that it’s up for grabs.
Davidsonian: ‘How do you feel
about the fan support last season,
and whatare your expectations for
it this year?

McKillop: When you are win-
ning, you’re going to attract sup-
port. There’s no doubt about that,
and I think Dave Fagg and his
football team have proven that.
I’mextremely impressed with what
the student body has done with the
football team in terms of their
support. The crowds are enthusi-
astic, the crowds are responsive,

and the crowds are rather large in
number, and that’s consistent with
winning. The cheerleaders have
made an effort to be as well-pre-
pared and enthusuastic as they
possibly can be. Right now there is
a Spirit’ of Sucess that’s all over
campus, because of the sucess of
the sports teams, and the leader-
ship of Terry Holland, and we hope
this spirit carries over into basket-
ball season.

Davidsonian: What is the impor-
tance of your conference affili-
ation?

McKillop: It gives us a goal to
shoot for. Now we have a goal to
look forward to all season long,
instead of playing game to game.
