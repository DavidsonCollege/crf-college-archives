ABC Unveils First
“True” Reality TV Show

Simon Cowell will host ABC’s
newest primetime reality show,
American Idle, in which contes-
tants will be critiqued on their sloth,
gluttony, and ability to watch hours
of useless television. Panel judges
will include Diego Maradona and
the entire cast of Half Baked. In
the network premiere episode, con-
testants will be required to will a
Cheetoh from the floor into their
slobbering, pathetic mouths. Their

Raunchy Research:
Scandal at the Ref. Desk

E.H. Little Library —Reference
Librarian Helen Bailey was con-
sulted and insulted for the first
time in her six-year employment
at Davidson. Awkward senior Jef-
frey Grabowski cornered Bailey at
her desk for over an hour and a half
while doing research for his first-
ever date.

“J just want to know what to do
when the time is right,” Grabowski
explained. “I’ve read a few anatomy
textbooks before so I know where
everything’s located. I just need ad-
vice on the ‘tender touch.’ ”

Administrators plan to revise
the motto, “Have a question? Ask
a librarian,” in order to avoid birds-
and-bees tutorials in the future.

DAVIDSON'S NEWS FOLLOWER
Heinze, French’se to Sponsor
Self-Selection Night 2010

Patterson Court— Eating hous-
es, fraternities and other spectators
all gathered to celebrate the Class
of 2012’s participation in the Pat-
terson Court Community. While
scantily-clad fraternity men pre-
pared to race through the women’s
houses, the women themselves
were celebrating one of America’s
proudest traditions: condiments.

Approximately $5,000 was
spent on sauces, marinades, gra-
vies, and other assorted edible,
semi-liquid products for the night’s
festivities. A representative from
the H. J. Heinz Company was on
hand to witness the event and was
astounded by the typically Ameri-
can wastefulness and scale of con-
sumption. “There must have been
a layer of relish four inches deep,”
he said. “That level of commitment
should be rewarded.”

“There must have been
a layer of relish four
inches deep...that level
of commitment should
be rewarded.”

Connor girl Julie Ladd °10
shared her excitement about the
sponsorship deal offered them.
“We'll have to change from the tra-
ditional camouflage outfits to those
goofy ketchup costumes, but it'll be
worth it. They’re bringing the cute,

Obama Nails Speech,

Screws Oath

Washington, D.C.—History in
the making, it seems, has as much
grandeur as blundering. Millions
took to the streets as Obama flaw-
lessly delivered a near 20-minute
speech outlining the challenges to
be faced and met during the four
years of his presidency. When it
was time to repeat the oath that
would swear him in to office, how-
ever, Obama had some trouble.
“Tt was the verbal equivalent of a
handshake attempt encountering a
high five,” said one Davidson ob-
server. “Just awkward. Embarrass-
ing to witness.”

Chief Justice John Roberts was
delivering the oath Obama was to
recite when Obama “straight up
jumped the gun.” The soon-to-be
president cut off Roberts mid-sen-
tence and a stuttering, confused
moment ensued. Roberts quickly
resumed the ceremony.

Marketers roamed the Court last
Friday, polling students and not-
ing consumption habits

RedBull girls,” She said.Corporate
involvement in school traditions
has generally been frowned upon,
but due to recent economic devel-
opments, Davidson College admin-
istrators are warming to corporate
advances.

The new partnership, taking ef-
fect next fall, would prohibit any
mustard besides French’s® Classic
Yellow variety to be served any-
where on campus. In return, eat-
ing houses would be offered con-
diments at wholesale prices and
would be involved in advanced
product testing for the companies.

“I think this is a smart move
for us, monetarily and gastronomi-
cally,” Warmer self-selection chair
Naomi Norris ’11 said. “Everyone
from Bert & Rocky’s to Cookout is
taking note of our signature series
of toppings. It’s time to supersize.”

The Chief Justice seemed un-
concerned with the leap-frog of
recitations that occured. “Coulda
happened to anyone,” he shrugged.
“First day of school, you get ner-
vous...same kind of deal.”

GOP spokespeople _ pointing
to the event claim Obama is not
a team player. Said Oregon Sena-
tor Charles Mueller (R), “Today
was all Obama. I was more wor-
ried about how Bush is handling
things—moving out is always a
stressful experience.”
