Andy Owen's)
"In Random Order"
Showing in Chambers

By Will Montgomery

A provocative series of works
by visiting Assistant Art Professor
Andy Owen is currently displayed
in the Chambers Gallery. Owen's
professional forte is printmaking,
and he instructs both Design and
Printmaking this semester. His
show, entitled “In Random Order”
presents a combination of pieces
done through variations of the print-
making process.

Much of the success of his
show stems from the interplay
between traditional techniques and
innovation. Owens explains that
lithography has been done for
centuries. It involves drawing onto
a stone and using the repellant
properties of oil and water to cre-
ate an image. The process is me-
thodical and time-consuming, and
involves many steps. Creating
vitreographs is equally painstak-
ing process, but the technique of
sandblasting glass sheets is rela-
tively new and technologically
advanced.

Recent pieces done this fall
with a steamroller in the parking
lot behind the computer services
center emphasize a developed
process as well. Yet the result is
far more liberated and spontane-
ous, approaching performance art.
Owens flattens objects, which
smear paint onto paper as they are
crushed.

The images are random, yet
often maintain some semblance of
the geometry and structure of the
original object. His crushed sun-

Fugitive Moments, by Andy Owen, Lithograph, 10"x12'

glasses piece incorporates the
boards used to print the image with
the paper printed product to form a
triptych. Owens chooses to in-
clude the “press” in order to reiter-
ate the sense of process and pro-
vide a glimpse at where the print
came from.

Owens usually finds the ob-
jects in trash-dumps, and relates
that much of the fun in his work
comes from meeting the people
who supply him with trash or lend
him steamrollers. He tells of the
worker at a plastic supply house
who could identify the chemical
makeup of any piece of plastic
trash simply by lighting acorner of
the plastic and sniffing the black
glob of toxic smoke.

Besides the eclectic characters
he encounters while searching for
material, the actual printing proc-
ess behind the computer center
provided social interactionas well,
involving students and curious
bystanders. Owens’ s images them-
selves express this context of many
parts contributing a single
moment. They contain rich explo-
sions of color and hyperactive
texture, but are subtly restrained
by the hard edges of gears, com-
puter disks, wires, and.car parts.

_ Theexhibit runs through Feb-

ruary 13 and is open during regular
Chambers Gallery hours. Due to
the range and variety of the show,
the exhibit is well worth visiting
several times. A reception for the
artist will be held on Friday, Janu-
ary 24 at 7:30 p.m.

By Jim Carswell

The first words to escape the
mouth of Bono, that eternally
troubled and usually quite pushy
Irishman, on U2’s new album
Achtung Baby are “I’m ready,
I’m ready for the laughing gas.”
This line proves prophetic as the
sickeningly socially conscious
band throws pretense and any
message out the window on their
new effort. While Bono used to
tell us he had only “a red guitar,
three chords, and the truth” (from
Rattle and Hum), he seems some-
how to have aquired some dance
moves and a sense of humor in
the last three years. And it is a
relief.

When U2 started producing
music in the early 80s, their vi-
sion was clouded by the conflict
and violence they had expéeti-
enced growing up in Northern

Throughout the three hours of
J.F.K.,director Oliver Stone bom-
bards the audience ‘with a seem-
ingly endless barrage of visual,
aural and moral assaults. Stone
has picked the most salient frag-
ments of several contradicting
theories regarding the assassina-
tion of John F. Kennedy, and he
has strewn them together to create
a brilliant thriller. Momentarily
avoiding the debate which has pre-
occupied the pundits, J. F. K. is an
excellent entertainment.

The world is nuts, folks, com-
pletely and utterly whacked be-
yond what any of us can hope to
control. And this same wonderful
Earth that brings us televised pro-
fessional bowling and drive-by
random shootings continues star-
ing us right in the face and refuses
to blink.

This is the intermittently de-
pressing message that Lawrence
Kasdan’s Grand Canyon delivers
us from the get-go. But it also
implies hope, that perhaps a time
might come when it doesn’t seem
like all that fine an idea to shoot
each other upina wild masochistic
frenzy. Just maybe.

I guess I can begin by saying
that this is an altogether worth-

Achtung Baby: U2's New Attitude Succeeds

Ireland. The whole situation re-
sulted in compelling music with
strong messages for the people
involved in the carnage. And it
caught the ear of the younger rec-
ord-buying public, as they were in-
trigued by the urgency of the music.
By the release of their secondalbum
Boy, U2 had taken a position of
great influence on the young people
of Europe as well as America.
Refusing to ignore the respon-
sibility of that position, they con-
tinued to promote attitudes of tol-
erance and social responsibility,
notably with their albums The Un-
forgettable Fire, a tribute to Mar-
tin Luther King Jr., and The Joshua
Tree, whose songs comment on
the social problems of this coun-
try. The switch from an exaspera-
tion with Ireland’s problems to a
preoccupation America’s, though,
was a turing point for the band.

Oliver Stone's Moralizing Doesn't Mar
The Suspenseful and Exciting J. F. K.

1968 for conspiring to kill John
Kennedy. As expected, Costner’s
rendering of Garrison is in the same
heroic vein as his portrayals of
Eliot Ness in The Untouchables,
Lt. Dunbar in Dances With Wolves,
and Robin Hood in Robin Hood--
Prince of Thieves. Costner’s per-
formance in J. F..K. is just as
tedious as in the aforementioned
showcases for the star.

The characters and actors sur-
rounding Costner are far more
interesting. Joe Pesci is jarring as
alleged conspirator David Ferrie.
The hysterical articulation which
Pesci brings to the psychotic Fer-
rie will possibly garner him a sec-
ond Academy Award. Tommy

trip to Charlotte.

First of all, the screenplay is
one of the most original I’ve ever
seen. Writers Lawrence and Meg
Kasdan provide slight glimpses of
characters for thé most of the film
and thus allow the audience to
construct links for themselves and
pronounce its own judgments on
what one means to another.

The Kasdans’ end product
presents six Los Angeles residents
on opposite sides of the socio-
economic fence and each person’s

- realizations that none can escape
the problems of the others. The
viewer sees characters with widely
varying financial resources (the
metaphorical canyon) and strik-
ingly similar inabilities to deny
suffering in the world. Those that

While their outrage at society’s
injustice remains legitimate, the
crossing to this continent may
have blunted U2’s wit. By the
time Rattle and Hum came out
in 1988, Bono was taking back
songs that “Charles Manson
stole from the Beatles” (“Helter
Skelter’) and telling us about
the color of his guitar and the
truth-he had.

It was all just annoying, re-
ally. The pretension, the admo-
nitions, the preaching -- it had
lost its “importance.” And,
thankfully, the band tooka long
break, on which they seem to
have aquired a new attitude
toward their music. It doesn’t
have to push people toward
progress, but it can, from time
