back because “the crowd was too
near the sidelines for a sleeper to
be detected.” George Crane looked
good in snagging a few passes for
the freshmen, while Roland, Stanley,
and Whisnant stood out for the
sophs.

During the half. both the other
events—a tug o° war and a relay
race—were staged. and both were
won by the sophomores. The fresh-
man won the first pull on the tug
o’ war, but the sophs took the next
two and also the relay race to in-
sure victory. Realizing this, most
of the crowd left, and only a few
disconsolate freshmen remained to

cheer a losing cause. |
Judge Hoopy Davis remarked
that the freshmen came closer than
he anticipated, but all the rest of
the student body could say was,
“Where's your hat, freshman?”

In Superior, Wisconsin, the favorite
gathering spot of students at the
Superior State College is the Cafe-

—full of friendly collegiate atmos-

around, ice-cold Coca-Cola gets the
call. For here, as in college haunts
everywhere—Coke belongs.

Ask for it either way ... both
trade-marks mean the same thing.
