Davidson's debating team, now tour-
ing the West, composed of Tyler Port
and James Salango, was victorious in
its first engagement, with the Univer-
sity of the South at Sewanee, Tenn.,
last Friday evening, March 15.

Port and Salango upheld the affirma-
tive side of the question, Resolved:
That the nations shculd agree to pre-
vent the international shipment of arms
and munitions.

The western debate team then jour-
neyed to Centre, Ky., there to engage

March 20, they will debate with the
University of Kentucky at Lexington,
Ky. From there they will return to
the campus to take part in coming home
debates.

This is Port's first year in-varsity col-
lege debating. He was, however, a
member of last year’s freshman debate
team. Salango, a junior, is a transfer
from Davis-Elkins Junior College, and
is also new to varsity debating.

The first home debate of the year
will be held Friday night, March 22,

Twelve,” by the Red and Black Mas-
quers. Davidson's opponents will be the
debating team from Southwestern Uni-
versity, Memphis, Tenn. Bob Smith and
Wade Boggs will represent Davidson in
this debate.

This is Smith’s third year as varsity
debater; he was also on the freshman
debating team his freshman year. Boggs
is a sophomore, and this is his first year
of college debating. These men and
P. Y. Herlan will “leave shortly before
the holidays on a debate tour through-
out the eastern part of the United
States.

They will engage in debate with Wil-

¢

liam and Mary, Rutgers University,
Bucknell University, and Middlebury
College, upholding the negative side of

the query, Resolved: That the nations
should agree to prevent the internation-
al shipment of arms and munitions.

There will be four home debates this
year. No admission charges will be
made, and all students and townspeople
are cordially invited to attend . The sub-
ject for these debates will be the same
as the other intercollegiate debates... It
is planned that Skip Brown and Bob
Smith will appear together in the last
of the home debates.

The southern debating team, composed
of Harold Sugg and Albert Stutts, re-
turned to the campus March 9, after suc-
cessful meets with the College of
Charleston, the University of Miami,
Emory University, and Georgia. Tech.
The southern team upheld the affirma-
tive side of the question.

Junior Class Gives Brilliant

_ Set Of Dances In Charlotte

Miss Elizabeth Neil ( Neil Of Marion Is
Selected Queen Of Junior
Class Dances

A brilliant set of Junior class dances,
presented at the Charlotte Armory-Au-
ditorium, terminated with a gay,’ infor-
mal affair on Saturday night, March 16,
with Miss Elizabeth Neil of Marion se-
lected as “Queen of the Junior Speak-
ing Dances.”

With much pomp and ceremony, Ma-
jor R. T. Rhett of Davidson presented
the popularly-elected beauty queen with
the crown of the Junior Speaking
Dances. Ray Richardson, senior at Da-
vidson College, was Miss Neil’s escort.

Bill Allsbrook and his orchestra were
received with much popular acclaim. His
newly-adopted torch singer, Lou Greg-

ory, met every possible expectation with
her popular arrangements of the latest
hits. Allsbrook’s imitation of Guy I.om-
bardo’s interpretation of “OQ Davidson”

was the star performance of the eve-
ning.

“Geddie” Monroe offered the Mon-
roe’s interpretation of “Love Is Just

Around the Corner,” “Here Come the
British,” “Believe It, Beloved,” “Dinah,”
and other popular song hits. Monroe
and Bill Northen aided Miss Gregory
in a novelty number, “The Breeze.”

“Bird the Cage" tempted many
members of the student body to dem-
onstrate hidden abilities in mimicking
twentieth century Russian fan dancers.
Their snake-like performances and char-
acteristic duck walks were the center
of attraction during the free exhibition
period.
