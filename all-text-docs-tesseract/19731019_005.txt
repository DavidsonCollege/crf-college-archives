LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

ROTC Curriculum Defended,
Third Degree Murder Scorned

To the Editor:

I address these remarks to
the editorial comment on ROTC
in last week’s DAVIDSONIAN.
The article maintained that
academic credit should not be
given for ROTC because ‘“‘much
more of it is vocational rather
than academic in nature’.

This argument is faulty for
two reasons. First, it is untrue,
for the policy in the Army
ROTC ‘Program of _In-
struction’’ booklet dictates that
vocational instruction will not
be emphasized and that it
should serve only as a
meaningful background for the
academic curriculum. As an
ROTC cadet this has been my

experience.

Furthermore, the ROTC
curriculum provides no
technical training in any job
specialty.

Rather it is designed to

develop talents in leadership,
management and organization,
talents which are invaluable in
any civilian career.

Secondly, the argument
becomes humorously _ in-
consistent in the light of plans
by Prof. R. Kincaid “‘to explore
new ways to give our students
vocational experiences before
they graduate from college.’

The final point to which I
offer rebuttal is the idea that
there is an inconsistency in in-
cluding military science in the
curriculum of our college
because we profess a Christian
commitment.

Is being a _ Christian
synonymous with being a con-
scientious objector? To some
people it may be, but to many
others, undoubtedly the majori-
ty of our nation’s citizens, it is

not.

Without this point, I cannot
see how ROTC interferes with
our Christian goals. After all, it
can be validly argued that it is
partly thanks to “the arts of
warfare” that we still possess
the freedom to commit our-
selves to the Christian faith.

Moreover, I find excellent
examples of the kind of
Christian commitment to~which
our college catalogue refers in
the officers of our ROTC depart-
ment. .

Does ROTC have a place in
the curriculum at Davidson? Af-

PICTURE TO THE EDITOR

ter a.close look, I believe it
does.

To the Editor:

1 was deeply impressed by
Dr. Palmer’s words in the
faculty guest column of the Oct.
12 edition of THE DAVID-
SONIAN. It sparked a reaction
that is long overdue and which
has been long in the gestation.

I quote from his column a
small piece from which my
reaction initiates: ‘‘Somewhere
we, as predecessors, have done
you, as students, a grave disser-
vice. We have given you the
message, sometimes openly
and sometimes unwittingly,
that your worth was a matter of
degree.”’

The degree of which Dr.
Palmer speaks is, for Davidson
students, the MA and or the
Ph D. Those students who plan
to climb the slopes to those

degrees receive, in general, en-
couragement and rein-
forcement.

But those of us who, for many
reasons, do not plan graduate
work are left to defend our self-
respect against the arrogance
and apathy of the faculty, the
majority of which hold Ph D’s.

There is much danger here in
generalizations. Indeed, I would
do a grave disservice to the
many faculty members here
who are genuinely interested in
the student as he relates to a
specific classroom.

For this interest all students
should be grateful.

But there still remains an
overriding feeling for those of
us not planning graduate work
that we are getting the short
end of the stick.

I have a question to put to the
faculty. It need not be answered
audibly, but I implore truth-
fully.

The question is this: Do you
feel that every advisee, whether
he is a prospect for graduate
school or not, is worth your time
and effort?

To reward with attention and
approval students planning
graduate work and to punish

students not graduate
work is not only a disservice to
those not graduate

work, but also. and to perhaps a

greater degree, it is a disser-
vice to the marginal student
who is so impressionable in his
early years at Davidson.

Something like 75 percent of
Davidson graduates go on to
graduate school. One wonders
what the percentage would be
were it not for the system of
rewards and _ punishments
which has been set up here.

One wonders how many
Davidson graduates who go to
graduate school really want to
go to graduate school, and how
many are railroaded into it by
pressures of the system.

I have resisted the pressures
here at Davidson in the belief
that somewhere, someone, on
the outside at least, will be in-
terested not in my degree, but
in me and my worth in its own
right.

“The Hours Are Long, The Pay Is Nill”

Campus Tax Council Allocates

Funds For ‘Quips And Cranks’

I feel obliged to clarify the
relationship between the Quips
and Cranks and the Campus
Tax Council. All chartered
student organizations and cer-
tain other activities such as the
Performing Arts Series are fun-
ded by Campus Tax.

Traditionally meeting only
several times in the spring to
divide up the student activities
fee, Campus Tax has never
believed it possessed me
responsibility and power
police these organizations to hed
sure proper management of
funds.

Exactly how student
organizations spend their
money after it has been
allocated to them has not been
the concern of Campus Tax, and

so.

The effects of Campus Tax’s
actions on the annual are only
those created by the amount of
money budgeted to the annual.

Perhaps there are other ef-
fects created by the peculiar
circumstances in which the
process of funding the annual
finds itself, but I cannot see
any. The editor of Quips and

Cranks is elected in January. -

He is not elected ‘‘with’ a
budget, indeed, he has four
months to devise a budget and
present it to Campus Tax in

- April or May.

The concept of incremental
budgeting plays an important
part here, for the budget is
based largely on the previous
year’s total, which is then
usually increased.

The previous year’s budget
provides a ‘‘ball park’’ figure
for the editor to work with. But
only after Campus Tax has
authorized a budget for the an-
nual can the editor make
definite plans.

He still has four months
before school begins in Sep-
tember for revised planning.

The essential problem of the
annual regarding financing is
that the editor is elected and
begins to plan his book several
months before he knows exactly
how much money he will have.

There are two obvious
solutions: elect the editor in the
spring or have Campus Tax
meet earlier in the year.

Aside from caus... a special
election, electing the editor in
the spring will decrease plan-
ning time. Making Campus Tax
meet to allocate funds earlier in
the year creates problems for
other organizations, forcing
them to budget their activities a
year and a half in advance,
which is rather unreasonable.

It is not possible to fund the
annual at one time, say in the
winter, and fund other
organizations at another time,
say in the spring.

Campus Tax has a limited
amount of funds, which are
divided among the various
groups. The sum of the requests
always exceeds the amount of
money available, so some cut-
ting must be done.

This cutting is not arbitrary
or indiscriminate, but is closely
tied to the amount of requests of
all the groups.

Although Campus Tax would
prefer to grant every group's
total request, some reductions
are necessary, and an attempt
is made to make these reduc-
tions as equitable among the
groups as is possible.

To do this all requests must
be considered at the same time.

As it now stands, Campus Tax
meets near the end of the school
year, which corresponds to the
end of the fiscal year for most
student organizations. This
makes it possible for funds to be
available immediately when
school resumes in the fall.

This system has many ad-
vantages and is not the source
of the current problem.

Determining how much
money the annual should
receive poses several problems.

There has been a general
decline of student interest in the

annual, a phenomena reflected
by the reduction of the annual’s
budget in recent years.

Prior to this reduction an-
nuals were funded in the $16,000
area. This year’s annual was
allocated $9500.

Beyond student discontent
with such an expensive annual,
there has been a growing
question about the purpose of
the annual and whether it can
achieve this purpose with its
present format.

Another reason for reductions
in the annual's budget has been
the appearance of new student
organizations desirous and
worthy of funds from Campus

iden the student activities

fee is raised to provide Campus
Tax with more money, funds

for these new groups must be

‘found’ by reducing the
budgets of the old
organizations.

These reductions are in-
cremental from year to year.
Organizational budgets are
never reduced during the year
once the allocation is made.

Dealing specifically with last
year’s annual, one of the
reasons for the reduction of its
budget in comparison to the
year prior was the increase in
WDAV's budget to provide
funds for conversion to FM.

-The questions of how much
money the annual should
receive, how much money
students are willing to pay for
an annual, and what should be
and format of the annual are
still unresolved.

If you have any suggestions to
answer these questions I and
many others would like to know.

I am presently the student co-
chairman of the Campus Tax
Council.

Don’t Send Troops

A group of Davidson College employees and students have
started a petition drive protesting the possible involvement

of American troops in the Middle East conflict. The group,
the Committee For Non-Involvement In the Middle East,
began circulating petitions throughout the community on
Wednesday. On Friday, all the petitions will be collected, and
mailed to President Nixon as a protest against any such
escalation of U. S. involvement.
