Stories of desperation and hope
Awareness Weekend takes students into the city

By LISA GERRARD

The Salvation Army soup kitchen reeked
of the night’s supper of sauerkraut and
weiners, a meal most college students
would easily refuse, but among the 180 or
so cold and hungry men who
somberly awaited turns to eat, the
only complaint was that they could
have but one serving. More than
one returned to the steady drizzle
ort the’ street muttering, “I’m still
hungry.”

Through Charlotte soup kitch-
ens and shelters a group of 26
Davidson students, participants in
“Awareness Weekend,” caught
glimpses of life in the inner-city
January 13-15. An annual event
sponsored by the Chaplain Com-
mittee, Awareness Weekend gives
students of primarily middle and
upper class backgrounds the op-
portunity to do volunteer service
and interact with people from the
lower and lowest s of the so-
cio-economic ladder.

Students stay¢d at Christ
King Center, a church located/in
the middle of an incomplete Habi-
tat for Humanity neighborhood in
one of the most distressing sec-
tions of Charlotte.

The Davidson group found
sharp contrast there between .the
desperation of luck gone bad and the hope
for renewal at the heart of the city. Dilapi-
dated dwellings with sagging front porches
and windows boarded up against the cold
stood side by side with the already reno-
vated, picture-book accomplishments of
caring Habitat builders.

Students spent Saturday performing
tasks like stuffing envelopes in the Habitat
for Humanity office, re-packaging
creamed corn at the Metrolina Food Bank,
and painting offices in two churches lo-
cated downtown, as well as visiting soup
kitchens and shelters.

Within the various work: assignments
they encountered people who shared with
them a city different from the one students
know through their brief excursions off-
campus. For the homeless and poor, Char-

lotte has little to do with freeways, shop-
ping malls, nice restaurants and sky-scrap-
ing office buildings.

Often a world of hardship and struggle,
their city is a place where any money aman

he >

might make is likely to disappear from his
pockets while he sleeps, where women
wonder day by day how to help their chil-
dren build a better life than they have
known.

“It really made me think about people:

who don’t have money to put food on the
table,” said sophomore Jacquie Bussie,
who had never worked in a soup kitchen
before. “That’s something I never really
had to come face to face with before--
things like not being able to get a job.”
Bussie said that the people at the Salva-
tion Army seemed as fully human to her as
others more fortunate. “I was thinking. all
‘the time I was theré that I was no different
from them. I feel really sheltered here. (at
Davidson) sometimes. One thing about
Awareness Weekend is that it made me

think I have so many blessings and I did
nothing to deserve them.”

Sophomore Tyndall Davis and _ three
other volunteers visited a Salvation Army
shelter for women. In a smoke-filled

lounge the students listened as two mothers
talked about plans for educating their tod-
diers. According to Davis, one said that she
had worked “extensively” with her baby
and that he was very “advanced” for his
age. The other spoke of a certain “educa-
tional toy” by Fisher Price and a telescope
that she planned to get for her three chil-
dren as soon as she could.

“They seemed so normal and like they
had it all together; it really made me won-
der how they got there. It seemed like they
could be part of the mainstream so easily,”
Davis said.

“It makes me a lot more sympathetic to
people in that situation, that sometimes

_ maybe it’s not so much their fault, but that
‘they’ve fallen through the cracks some-

how.”

Sophomore Laurie Reams also visited
the women’s shelter. She said, “I was im-
pressed by how much it meant to the
women in there for you to take time out to
speak to them. At first there was a hesitancy
to let down their pride, but once
they saw that we were sincere,
talking to them seemed to give
them a better self-image. Being
able to talk about their kids
renewed their faith that they
were good mothers and that
they had a meaningful role.”

When senior Tim Pos-
ton, who organized the week-
end, visited an uptown day shel-
ter, a group of men told him that
the center was not doing its job.
When “somebody important,”
like Mayor Sue Myrick or phi-
lanthropist George Shinn,
comes for lunch, the shelter
serves good, complete meals,
said the men. Otherwise, they
hardly ever have anything but
coffee and doughnuts. .

The mefi desperately
wanted something to be done
about the situation. When one
particularly vocal member of
the group realized that Poston
was only a student, rather thana
reporter from the Charlotte Ob-
server, he threw up his hands.
Poston encouraged the man to keep talking
because one day the “student” might be in
a better position to help. Slowly walking
away and looking Poston straight in the
eye, the man replied, “Yeah, and by that
time I’1l be dead.”

The Salvation Army provides temporary
living space above the soup kitchen for
men with jobs. While successive crowds
came in for sauerkraut and weiners, several
residents remained downstairs to joke with
the students, tell stories and share family
pictures. In these men students perceived a
beat of hope at the heart of the city.

One man spoke of his plans to go back
home to his wife in Florida after working

Tales of England

By JERRILYN WOODARD

Study abroad was one of the
best things I’ve ever done in my
life and I recommend it to every-
one. Each person’s experience in
another country is unique. I hope
I have expressed many facets of
my experience through these ex-
cerpts from the daily journal I
kept during my four month stay in
England.

September before my ee
program began. I was still trav-
elling, taking a weekend trip from
London to the small, rural town of

‘Oldendorf, West Germany, to

visit my Davidson roommate,
Sarah Powell.

3 A.M. Again. But this time I’m
not studying. I’m talking to an-
other Brit, trying to convince him
that Reagan is not completely
senile and that the news clip cited
on Radio 1 from the U.S. National
Enquirer is nota valid news story.
Perhaps I’m telling some English

lad or lass that the fact that Ameri-
can movies and television pro-
grams show people conversing on
the phone for hours is not proof
that all Americans are rich be-
cause local phone calls in the
States are free.

It’s entirely possible that I am
not talking at all, but instead am
listening to some British bloke
(yes, they really do say that as
much as Andy Capp does) as he
explains to me why a girl would
never ask a guy to dance ata *bop’
or nightclub in England. Or why
at every dinner or tea (lunch or
supper) there are two types of
potatoes offered, even if the main
dish is pasta!

Or I might be sitting in a
Wendy’s restaurant in the Frank-
furt rail station in’ West Germany
with another American student
