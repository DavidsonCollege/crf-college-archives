Board of Trustees will consider budget at next meeting

By RICK JENKINS
News Editor

When the Board of Trustees
meet at Davidson on February
22 and 23, next year’s budget
on their agenda. According to
Chairman Warner Hall, “The
winter meeting always revolves
around financial matters.”

Assistant to the President
Cindy McDowell, who is han-
dling preparations for the mee-
ting, explained that the Februa-
ry meeting of the Trustees is
usually when the budget is
examined in depth.

According to Comptroller
Bob Davidson, the proposed
budget was sent last week to
each member of the Trustee’s
Finance and Management Com-
mittee. They are currently re-
viewing the proposed budget,
and will present it Friday
morning to the full Board. The
Board will then either approve
it or ask the administration for
certain adjustments. In this
latter case, final approval will
be postponed until the Trustee’s
May meeting, according to
Davidson.

The proposed budget is the
culmination of three months of
analysis, Davidson said. It
began with funding requests
from each individual depart-
ment, both academic and admi-
nistrative. The Senior Staff,
consisting of the heads of each

Student Government Associ-
ation respresentatives will pre-
sent results of a student opinion
poll conducted this past week at
the trustee dinner next Thurs-
day. SGA senators hope to
make Trustees aware of cur-
rently controversial issues and
of general student feeling about
these issues such as self-sche-
duled exams, international pro-
grams, course enrollment, fa-
culty evaluation, and the athle-
tic budget.

“The SGA is in contact with
the Trustees. all year long and
we can tell them what we think,
but it has a little bit more
impact, and rightly so, if at
least once a year the Trustees
can get some feel for the opinion
of the student body at large,”
explained SGA Vice-President
John Jackson.

According to Jackson, the
survey last year made a sizable
impression on the Trustee.. He
expects a similar impact this
year.

The survey results will also
be distributed to the Educatio-
nal Policy Committee and admi-
niStrators.

The questionnaire survey was
drawn up by the SGA Senate
and distributed to 175 students
randomly selected by computer
as a representative sample.
Jackson said the multiple choice
questionnaire was generally a
good one, although he admitted

there were some questions |

which did not give enough
possible choices or which were
poorly worded.

then met to suggest cuts. The
proposed. budget was then re-

_turned to each department for

these reductions. College Presi-
dent.Samuel Spencer made a
final, run-through and checked
that it was a balanced budget.
Thursday night, the Trustees
will join fifty Davidson stu-
dents-in a special dinner spon-
sored by the Student Govern-
ment Association Senate, ac-

cording to SGA President
Bruce Brown. Brown said any

student interested in attenditig

the dinner should sign up at the
Union Desk on a first-come,
first-serve basis.

The SGA Senate plans to
feature two student speakers at
the dinner to discuss two issues,
said Brown. The topics will be
athetics and admissions, he
said, although the specific
points of each topic have not yet
been determined.

The Senate dinner program
Thursday night will be followed
by a question and answer
period, Brown said.

Clarifications

In preparing last week’s Da-
vidsonian for press, Peggy No-
el’s letter to the editor about
registration problems was unin-
telligible disarranged.

The following is a complete
copy of the original letter:

To the Editor: ‘

During the past three years I
have heard a steadily increasing
number of complaints from
frustrated, disappointed stu-
dents over enrollment pro-
blems,’ registration, and drop-
add procedures.

The opportunity to present
these criticisms and alternative
procedures to open ears was
offered to the student body last
Thursday. A committee was set
up to take issue with the
rumored dissatisfactions; if
they take their cue from the
number of students present (14,
and only 3 SGA members when
the entire senate was supposed
to attend) they may well con-
cede that there are not any
problems, that everyone is hap-
py with the way things are, and
if students complain they do not
mean it-seriously..  _

In the words of Dr. Klein,
committee chairman, ‘‘we want
to solve the problem, but ‘we
have to know what the problem
is.

“We are not bound to the
current registration procecures,
if there is a better way we can
change,”’ said Dr. Burts. The
committee wants to help us arid
you know as well as I do that
something has to be done.

Do we want to raise the

ceilings on oversubscribed cour-
ses and sacrifice the educational
advantages of small class size?
Is there cause to exert pressure
on the administration to reallo-
cate the budget so that more
professors can be hired? Are
students who are dissatisfied
with their schedules able to
work their problems out during
the drop-add period? Do we
want afternoon classes, night
classes, or classes during the
10:00 hour? Is it fair for
students who don’t need their
good numbers to use them to
obtain courses for a friend with
a bad number?

These are only a few of the
questions that need to be ad-
dressed. Either you need to
channel your complaints in the
right direction or stop complai-
