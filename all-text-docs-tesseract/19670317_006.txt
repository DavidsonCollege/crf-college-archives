PERSONAL DECISION
Welsh Explains Role Of Courage

Welsh said that those who ask,
“Would you have fought against
Hitler?*’ do not understand that
what matters is the world situa-
tion now, not the world situa-
tion 20 years ago.

In his opinion, the situation
now is difficult to evaluate. The
war in Vietnam is being glossed
over, he said. The statements
of officials. such as Gen. West-
moreland, do not really say any-
thing.

Such statements as. ‘““We are
cleaning out the Communists,”

| overlook the fact that we are

killling some innocent people
along the way. “They should tell
it like it is.’ said Welsh.

He. illustrated his point that
people should make their own
decision by telting of an experi-
ence he had at bayonet practice
in boot camp. The sergeant. in
charge of bayonet training would
stand in front of the trainees
and shout, “What's a bayonet
for!’ The trainees were sup-
posed to shout back, “To kill,
to kill.”

Welsh said that one day it

struck him that he should not be
shouting ‘‘kill’’ along with every-
one else. ‘But then."’ he said,
“I did not have the courage to
carry out my feelings. So I
shouted along with everybody
else.”

He cited the experience of one
of his friends to demonstrate the
courage that Welsh needed in
his own situation. His friend had
joined the army with the knowl-
edge that he would be a radio-
man so that he would not be
killing anyone.

But later, when he realized
that he would be indirectly kill-
ing people, he applied for a re-
classification as u consicientious
objector. .

Welsh closed by offering the
advice a Quaker once gave to a
man carrying a sword. The Qua-
ker told him. ‘‘Wear that sword
as long as you can.’ Welsh said
men should fight as long as they
honestly feel they can. But when
they feel they cannot, then they
should have the moral courage
to follow their convictions.

Conscientious Objectors Base

Decision On Religious Belief

“The military doesn’t solve
any conflicts, it only creates
more conflicts,’ stated B. A.
Aiken in Tuesday night’s Open
End.

Aiken, Sam Johnson, and Dan
Mombrea, all conscientious ob-
jectors, discussed their draft
status in a panel moderated by
Dr. Max Polley.

Each panelist explained that
his objection to war was based
on religious belief or training,

The new “action Union.”
headed by president B. A. Aik-
en, took to the hills of Fletcher,
N. C., last weekend to plan Un-
ion activities through first se-
mester of next year, and to an-
alyze several modes of vitaliz-
ing the Union as center of stu-
dent activities.

Perhaps the students’ lack of
realization of the potential of the
Union lies at the crux of means
of improvement. As Sam Darby
commented, “No one comes to
the Union unless some activity
has been planned. Stidents. by
and large, put little emphasis
on self-entertainment.”’

The Union, through scheduling
some event every night to de-
velop the habit of stopping by
often to see ‘‘what's happening,”’
and stressing facilities for self-
entertainment hopes to invigo-
rate student patronage.

In further critique. board
members advanced other sug-
gestions. A consolidation of the

Aiken, classified 1-0 (not avail-

including non-combantant, but
willing to take a civilian job in
the national interest during war-
time), stated that he believed
that certain teachings attributed
to Christ are opposed to vio-
lence and war.

Mombren and Johnson, both
classified 1-A0 (available for
non-combatant military service

only), based their objections on.

the grounds of the ‘‘gospel of the
love ethic.”

Johnson defined God as ‘‘that

In answer to the question, ‘‘If
opposed to force, do you not op-
pose the nation-state maintained
by the army and armed po-
lice?" Aiken denied this assump-
tion, stating that he believed in
the need for law and order.
Johnson stated that if everyone
believed as he did “some an-
archy would result,’’ but that he
thought this unlikely.

and Johnson stated that they
would attempt to respond in oth-

running or counteracting the at-

In explaining his classification
of 1-A0, Johnson stated that
there was a “‘sliding scale of in-
volvement in the government"
during wartime. ‘Any participa-
tion in society during wartime
is involvement in the war, and
it is only a matter of to what
degree you want to become in-
