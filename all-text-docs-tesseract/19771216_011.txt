Quali

IS a way

to find happiness

By CHARLES ERWIN
Features Editor

Seven years ago Ralph Quacken-
bush started a hobby that cost him
his job.

He took an interest in the craft of
making furniture.

‘‘T made a lot of furniture for my
house. Then I made some to sell. I
began to get a lot of requests from
people. Next thing I knew I was
spending more time with my hobby
than anything else," he said.

“So I decided to go with this full
time.”’

One day in October of last year,
Quackenbush decided to close down
his Min Street soda shop called ‘Fhe
Hub’ across from the college church.
Out went the grill and magazine rack.
In went the circular saw and electric
plane.

In went happiness.

Ralph (he’s been ona first name
basis with students for years) works
fewer hours now, makes as much or
more money, and gets more satisfact-
ion from his work.

“This is a lot more creative than
making hamburgers!,”’ he said.

Ralph’s been so busy doing work
for others that he hasn’t had a chance
to finish a cobler’s bench for himself.

He is rushed right now trying to
refinish an oak table and three chairs
by Christmas. There’s furniture wait-
ing for him that he has not even had a
chance to pick up yet.

But if Christmas is a busy time for @

Ralph, it’s not really that much busier
than other times. It’s just hectic
because he’s faced with deadlines.
‘“‘At Christmastime people want
them on time. Mbt of the time, it

doesn’t matter if I’m a week or two |

late,” he said as he bent over to weave
cane fibers into a chair seat.

“Tt takes a lot of patience. As soon
as you start to rush something you'll
louse it up. You can’t rush it and do it
right. No way,’’ said Ralph, as a
small heater hummed beside him and
the cane fibers rasped in and out of
the seat bottom.

To those who don’t love sawdust
and old dust wooden parts, wardrobe

bottoms and rough walnut boards,

The Workbench might seem to be a
cluttered place.

To Ralph it’s not. He loathes the |
assembly line furniture being slapped |
together elsewhere and believes in his
work. ‘‘Good wood is so expensive |
now that they’re building fiberboard §
and plastic furniture, But it won’t @

last. [t’s junk,”’
He believes in craftsmanship.

Gravity's Rainbow by Thomas
Pynchon was also named with the
note that it ‘‘is best read when you
have no other pressures and a
Christmas party to gc to afterwards.”

Nicholas and Alexandra by Robert
K. Mssie was the first book to come to
Will: Terry’s mind. It kept him
enthralled on a trip out. West one
summer.
Mcolm Partin also named a book on
‘Russian history, The File on the Tsar
by Anthony Summers, along with
Vincent Cronin’s Napoleon Bona--
parte, he added ‘‘something totally
out of my field: Raw Universe: Its
Beginning and Its End, Mt’s version
of layman’s physics.

Physics professor Robert Afning
suggested books far from his field as
well.

His list included Six ad by Alistair

Cook which contains vignettes of

famous figures including Charlie
Chaplain’ and Peter Ustinov’s auto-
biography Dear a4

All God’s Dangers, a tape recorded
set of recollections of the twenties and
thirties from an old black man in

Alabama is, to Ernie Patterson, ‘‘an —
example of courage, intelligence, and
high moral qualities of a man who -

refused to compromise with his
beliefs.’’-

What self-respecting Romantic
would give up the poems of William

Blake (temporarily at least) for the

likes of Frank Sullivan, James Thur-
ber, Ring Lardner, Robert Buchley,

and Woody Allen? Charles Lloyd, of

course.

Donleavy, the story of an Irishman

Calvin’s Institutes of the Christian
Religion.

Perhaps one might alternate chap-

ters between the two... _
“1m very Yona or Nikos Kayant-

zakis,’’ said George Labban. ‘“‘To me
he reflects the Greeks in their finest
form, particularly the Cretans as a
special group of greeks.”’

Frank Bliss advocated a return to
childhood. A literary childhood at
least, to Alice in Wonderland,

Through the Looking Glass, and The .

Wind in the Willows. ‘I’ve found that
many students have had no experi-
ence with that kind of literature.’’

The Sea and the Jungle by H.M

Tomlinson, a story of the develop-
ment of South America was described
by Bliss as ‘‘stunning."’

J. Harris Proctor also suggested an
“adventuresome” book, Saul Bellow’s
Henderson, The Rain King. ‘‘It's
entertaining. I like the. style,’’ he
said. The story centers on an Ameri-
can tycoon who goes to Africa to find
himself

After too many pre-med committee
interviews, John Kello suggested a
great non-psychological thriller,
Gray’s Anatomy. The book is conpio-
usly illustrated. ‘‘Great for insomni-
acs,” he noted.

In anticipation of W.D. Davies’
January visits, Samuel Aioney sug-
gested his book The Sermon on the
Mint. He added, ‘‘tel the Humes
students to read their homework.”
