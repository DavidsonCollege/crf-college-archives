Winter term numbs and

-depresses students

By AIDA DOSS

Ask any senior. In fact, ask
any Davidson student. Even if
you've got two independent
studies and a seminar (as I do
this year), Winter Term is the
pits. Minds turn to yogurt or
take a vacation in Palm
Springs, bodies congeal on the
sidewalk and succumb to alien
invasion, and the spirit in
general takes a beating that not
even the Eternal Flame could
endure.
What is it that makes this
stretch of time so achingly and

overwhelmingly depressing? I .

have my answer; I’m a senior.
Here I sit, biding my time until
my release into the ‘‘real
world,’’ while June is surpri-
singly far away, the distance
being measured by the length of
a thesis and several term pa-
pers. For those who aren't
seniors, the distance must seem
further and even more uncon-
querable.

~And then there is the winter
weather—that chemist’s night-
mare concoction of wind, rain,
and slush topped off by gray
skies and just-above-freezing
temperatures that chills the
heart and numbs the bone (or
vice versa). The weather is
probably the easiest thing to
pin the blame on. Dr. Barbara
Ballard, one of Davidson's two
full-time professional psycholo-
gists, told me that in the winter
people tend to be “cooped up
more, in closer proximity to one
another, and there seems to be
less opportunity for play.’ She

stressed the importance of

“play,”” which she defined as
“respite from routine.”’ It could
be as simple as taking a walk
around the perimeter of the

campus or as strenuous as"

a Frisbee or football match. But
the body needs exercise to keep
the blood circulating which .in
turn keeps the brain functioning
(a taxing but inviolable require-
ment for remaining long at
Davidson). ‘“‘Relaxation can be
hard work,” Ballard said, ‘‘but
it is worth the effort. A person
can’t work well twelve hours a
day.”

Also adding to the winter
blues is the unfortunate timing
of the whole term. Because of
the three week Christmas
break, what we have. in effect,

is a thirteen week term during
the ugliest part of the year. The
fact that the days are shorter
now doesn’t seem to help much,
either. Did you realize that

‘when you finish reading this

article you will still have over
half a Winter Term to go? If
that’s not disheartening.... °
And finally, for whatever
reason, there seems to be a
greater strain put on personal
relationships during this eon of
days. Break-ups are more fre-
quent (though no less painful
for that fact), family tensions
loom larger, friendships are
tested by the pressures of

deadlines and reviews. Perhaps.

the nerves steal some rawness
from the winter winds or per-
haps a reaction to the holiday
spirit inevitably sets in, but
people are noticeably tnore cyn-
ical, more impatient, more un-
reasonable

The desire to escape this
combination of melodramatic
muck and harsh reality leads to
some potentially harmful prac-
tices. The use of drugs and

alcohol is a common method of

temporary escape which may
become more permanent and
more difficult to deal with as the
term wears on. ‘There are quite
a number of people who have
significant problems with alco-
hol,’”” Ballard said. ‘I get
concerned about the drinking.
It’s a shame to me when
people’s lives get that stress-
ful.” . \

Ballard also commented that
she was surprised by the num-
ber of ‘‘executive disorders”’
such as ulcers, colitis, and
problems with tranquilizers or

’ stress which were turning up. in

students.

Certainly not all of a stu-
dent's physical or emotional
problems are due to the vagar-
ies of Winter Term, nor does
everyone suffer equally. Also,
Ballard said, it is not abnormal
for moods to swing ‘‘from hill to
valley.’’ However, she added
that an extreme longevity or
intensity of depsession is a
warning sign not to be ignored.
When normal
eating, sleeping, studying—are
impaired, the situation becomes
serious. If you suspect that
you're in the grip of some winter

functions— *

plague, do go and talk to
someone about it. Listeners can
help immensely in the working
out or airing of a problem.

As long as there is a Winter
Term at Davidson, there will
probably be Winter Term blues.
If they hit you (as they’ve
occasionally hit me, even out of
season) don’t panic and don’t
fall asleep. Even a thirteen week
term won’t last forever, and
once it’s over there'll be all
those sunny days out at the lake
to congratulate yourself on
having made «it: and to worry
about next winter. —
