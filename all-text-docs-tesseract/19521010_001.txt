PEON ARMY MARCHES

ROTC unit pays humble respects to the Peoples’ Echelon of
non-deferred students.

Echelon Features
Satan’s Sad Saps

As a service feature The Davidsonian brings you on-the-
spot coverage of the Peoples’ Echelon at their drill Tuesday
afternoon. Pitch was running high in the P.E.O.N.S. camp as
a result of the following proclamation by Cadet Col. R. M.
Henry:

. SPECIAL ORDER

R.O.T.C. Headquarters
Training Note: 1-A3M1 Revised
Attention to Orders.

During the regular ROTC drill period on Tuesday afternoon (from
approximately 1330-1530), while an attempt is being made to coordinate,
organize, supervise, oversee, coordinate, maintain, prepare; examine,
plan, coordinate, evaluate, enforce, establish, determine, coordinate,
inculeate, and coordinate esprit de corps among the troops, a very
serious opposing course of action has been observed.

Countless hasty estimates, staff plans, and supervision have pro-
duced varying attitudes. Yet one opinion has been reached—that the
“peoples’ army” must be penetrated, enveloped, devastated, destroyed,
repelled, and counter-attacked. This is apparent when the unit com-
mander considers the following two (2) suggestions:

(1) They outshine the ROTC troops in military precision and
discipline;

(2) Their distinctive uniforms, or lack of such, fit better than
ours;

(3) Their cadet band is better coordinated;

(4) Their unit commander has a broad fundamental under-
standing, a good general background, a well-rounded staff, and
a lot of experience.

(S) Our morale breaks in their presence.

Fér the preceding reasons, therefore, it is necessary to order
the “peoples’ army” dissolved. By order of

the Republican side, while Mr.
Hamilton C. Jones of Charfotte,
will give that of the Democrats.

Jesse Fisher, head of the fo-
rums and after vespers discus-
sion committee for the Y, said
that there might be some
criticism of having the first fo-

_ the national elections made this
topic of paramount importance.

Sergeant Penley points out the main idea of the current economy run by the Army. Cadet Lt.
Brown Dennis observes.

of wt

The Army's cost-conscious and
supply economy programs have
been extended to include the
ROTC training. The limited pur-
chasing power of the “Defense
Dollar” on today’s market demands
that all persons using military
equipment be thoroughly indoctri-
nated in the use, care, maintenance
and cost of equipment. Every ef-
fort must be made to insure’ the
maximum usage of each item of
equipment and each dollar expend-
ed for defense,

Since most Americans are ac-
customed to plenty and waste is an
every day practice in American
homes, young men entering the
Armed Forces are inclined to con-
tinue these habits. In World War
II, battlefield waste and the un-
necessary floss of equipment by
most units was appalling. This
serious drain on our resources and
consequent increase of the public
debt called for preventive action.

Beginning in the latter. part of
World War II and continued in
the period leading up to the Ko-

SVM Reorganizes
For Active Year

The first meeting of. the Student
Volunteer Movement for Christian
Missions will be. held) on next
Tuesday, the 14th, in the Y lounge.

All students interested in Chris-
tian Missions, home and -foreign,
are invited to attend.

The Student Volunteer Move-
ment was founded in 1886 at Mt.
Hermon, Mass., when 100 students
volunteered for mission service.
Among the first 100 was‘ John R.
Mott. In the course of its 65-year
existence SVM has influenced ap-
proximately 20,000 men and women
to take the field in the service of
the missions of their various
churches,

In addition the movement
firmly set in the Divisions of Home
and Foreign Missions of the Na-
tional Council of Churches.

It should be noted that the group
is not interested along in those
young men and women who are
considering missions as a life work,
but all who are interested in the
evangelistic expansion of the
Christian Gospel.

The ultimate ideal of the move-
ment, however, is to provide the
background and situation for the
dedication of lives to the cause of
the spread of the gospel both at
home and abroad.

Annual Vote Nods

Standard

Photos

From a poll taken last week in chapel, the upperclassmen
decided to continue uniform coats and ties for the annual pic-
tures, and by a two to one majority’ decided to have their
names printed in gold on the cover of the annual.

The question put before the stu-
dents, “Are you in favor -of uni-
form coats ard ties For individual
annual pictures?" found 267 re-
plying “yes,” with 236 answering
“no.”

Mitchell Patton, editor of
this year's annual, has stated
that beginning Monday at 2

m., the photographer will be
on the campus to make in-
dividual pictures for the an-
nual.

This year a new firm, Waller
and Smith from Raleigh, will be
in charge of the pictures, Repre-
sentatives will be on the campus
for the entire week, working cach
day from 9 am, until 5:30 p.m,
with an hour for luneh from 1
nntil"2,

Pictures will be taken in the
usual place in the basement of
Chambers, beside the book
store.

Due to the change in firms from
Charlotte to Raleigh, it. will be
imperative that all»students have

their pictures made oh camptis,
next week during the allotted
time.

Changes Made
In Cut System

Davidson students are requested
to. notice that cut card procedure
remains the same as last year, with
the exception of office hours for
corrections and correction of errors
in V.T. absences.

Dean Bailey's office has found
it necessary to set aside certain
hours for the correction of errors
on cut cards. The schedule is: Wed-
nesday, Thursday and Friday: 12
noon-4 p.m.; Saturday and Monday,
4th period.

No honrs are set aside on Tues-
day, since full time is required
for preparation of cut cards.

In the past, errors in P.T.
absences were handled by the
instructors, Under the new
procedure, Mr. Scott will deal
with all P.T. errors.

For the benefit of freshmen and
transfers, a brief statement of the
cut card system at Davidson fol-
lows:

Cut cards will be in the stu-
dents box on Wednesday morning,
marked with all absences charged
during the proceding week.

If a student feels an error has
been made, he will consult the
professor of the course in which
the absence is charged. If the pro-
fessor agrees an error has been
made, he will excuse the absence.

As already noted, Mr. Scott will
correct all P.T. errors, and Mes,
Daggy will handle the cases in
which errors have been made in
chapel and vespers absences. In
all cases, the carrected cards must
be returned to Dean Bailey's of-
fice for correction of his records.

Dean Bailey emphasizes that cut
cards should be kept for the whole
semester, as they are the student's
only record of absences. Privately
kept records will not be accepta-
ble in case a question about the
number of cuts charged arises.

although the characters will gen-
erally read. their parts, the play
will be lit and costumed like a
regular production.

der of Archbishop Thomas Becket,

tempt at the Greek tragedy form,

formal dance will run from 8:00
tilt 12:00 Saturday night.

orchestra will furnish music for
the Homecoming Dances. Frankie
Lester and Joan Hovis will accom.

who wish membership cards
should. contact any member of the
Interfraternity Council.

pected to overlap the begin-

ning of the informal dance by
about thirty minutes.

ball game between Davidson and
Furman.
