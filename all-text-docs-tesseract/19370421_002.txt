IN MEMORIAM

The Davidsonian pauses with the stu-
dent body and many other friends to pay
respects to the memory of fellow stu-
dents A. C. “Sky” Cline and Hoxie
Thompson, who were so suddenly re-
moved from the activity of college life.

The passing of these two men was an
undoubted shock to the whole campus,
and the loss will indeed be felt. Both
men were active on the hill, and beloved
by their fellow students. Their potenti-
alities were inestimable.

There is the conéolation, however,
that both men passed on without soil
or blot of character even in the last mo-
ment of life.

We of The Davidsonian and the stu-
dent body as a whole mourn the loss of
these two, and extend sincerest sympa-
thies and condolence to the bereaved
families.

Sincere sympathies also to the parents
and friends of B. F. McLendon, Jr.,
former Davidson student, in their recent
bereavement.

RELICS OF NEY... Our thanks to Mr.
Charles W \llison, ‘O04, for collecting the
numerous interesting relics of Peter Stuart
Ney and making Davidson College the de
pository for these According to President
Lingle, they will be placed in the museum un-
til a new fireproof library has been built.
Since Ney is so closely linked with the his-
tory of the College, we feel that the relics
belong here. The interest of these is even

more enhanced by the Marshal Ney legend,
which has been discussed even more Tately

Mr. McCloy told the gathering
that a student who is a good ath-
lete, particularly in track or tennis,
is much more suitable for a Rhodes
scholarship than a student who has
taken no part in athletics, “Ath-
letics furnish the quickest means
of making friends with the Eng-
lish,” he said. “They think much
more highly of a good athlete than
we in America do.”

The tutorial system, he explained,
is the core of instruction at Oxford.
