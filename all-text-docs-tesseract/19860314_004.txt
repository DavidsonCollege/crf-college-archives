Combining rich, _ graceful
movements and dance steps with
elaborate costumes and makeup,
the Kuchipudi dance troupe
brought its unique art form to
Davidson Wednesday night. The
third of the Union-sponsored Art-
ist Series presentations was made
possible by the Festival of India
program which is currently tour-
ing the United States.

Kuchipudi is a small village in
Southeast India from which the
Kuchipudi form of dance origi-
nated. It is one of the few forms
which has been performed outside
its home area.

A key element of the
Kuchipudi dance is its ability to
tell a story or communicate

through movements. A demon-

Restaurant review

stration by one of the principle
musicians showed that by the sim-
ple movement of one hand, the
dancer can communicate ideas
such as cloud, forest, night,
ocean, and heaven, as well as cer-
tain gods. Combinations of hand
movements and foot stomps
(called karnas) can be used in the
course of a dance to tell an entire
story.

With only a brief fifteen mi-
nute intermission, the dancers
performed several solo dances and
one dramatic presentation over a
two hour period. Most of the
dances were performed by either
of the two male dancers and re-
volved around the story of the life
of the god Krishna.

Seven musicians provided the
music and rhythm with instru-
ments ranging from the familiar

flute and violin to the guitar-like
veena. This unique blend of in-
strumentation as well as the com-
plicated rhythmic _ structure
sounds rather strange to the west-
ern ear as there is little or no har-
mony evident in the music. The
vocals and tonal instruments car-
ried the melody simultaneously
while the drums emphasized each
step of the dancer. Most impres-
sive was the fact that the musi-
cians played without the aid of any
written music.

Unfortunately, unless one was
seated near the stage, it was im-
possible to see the make-up and
expressiveness of the dancers
clearly. Of course, the people in
the back of the auditorium fared
much better than the people who
didn’t come at all.

The pleasures of fried bologna and a suntan

By TREY JAMMES
It's spring, and who wants to
go to the same old places to eat.
As a public service, The Davidso-
nian has provided this space to en-
lighten its readers on new and ex-
citing dining establishments.

Harbor Lights

Located on scenic Lake Nor-
man, Harbor Lights provides the
best atmosphere of any restaurant
near Davidson. Seating is at pic-
nic tables overlooking the dock
and on a sunny day suntan lotion
and at least one hour are recom-
mended to make the experience
complete.

The menu includes almost
anything that can be cooked on a
grill and not much else. My favor-

ite is the fried bologna sandwich
with coleslaw, mustard, and to-
mato on it. While this may not
sound great, it is much better than
the average bologna sandwich and
is also a treat that cannot be found
anywhere else.

The hamburgers take a few
days to digest, but Coach John
Byrd thinks they are the best
greasy burgers he has ever had.
However, if you are planning to
do anything athletic the rest of the
day, I would suggest steering
clear of them.

All in all, Harbor Lights is not
going to win any awards for its
food. However, it does sell beer,
which always improves the taste;
plus the atmosphere makes for a
great spring afternoon adventure.

Harbor Lights is located about
four miles from Davidson. To get
there, continue west from Ham
and Eggs for one third of a mile.
Turn right at a big Pepsi sign
across from the Handy Pantry and
then just follow the signs. The
hours are Tuesday through Friday
10 a.m. to 3 p.m., Saturday and
Sunday 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. It costs
about the same as McDonald's.

The Huddle

For a more varied menu, try
The Huddle in Cornelius. The
club sandwich on toast is a must if
you are a deli sandwich fan. It has
turkey, ham, lettuce, cheese, to-
mato, and mayonnaise on three
pieces of bread to create an excel-
lent and very filling sandwich. If

you are not that hungry, the turkey
and cheese sandwich is almost the
same only smaller.

The best corndogs in the area
are also at The Huddle. If you
have never had a corndog, The
Huddle is the place to try one.

The hamburgers are very simi-
lar to the Commons’ burgers, not
bad, but not great either. Adding a
side order of tater tots, which are
much better than the fries, along
with a thick chocolate milkshake
makes a good meal for under four
dollars.

The food does take a while to
prepare, so if you are in a hurry, it
is a good idea to call your order in
ahead of time. The number is 892-
8468. If you do not mind the wait,
you can watch your favorite soaps

on the giant screen television. On
the weekends NASCAR races are
usually shown along with ACC
basketball. The other attraction is
_ 4 trivia game which can be played
in almost exactly the amount of
time it takes to prepare the food.

The Huddle is open from 10
a.m. to 12 p.m. everyday. To get
there head south on Main Street
past Cashion’s. It is easy to spot it
on the right. The Huddle costs
about $4.00 for an entree, side
order, and drink. Beer is sold for
on the premises drinking.

Harbor Lights and the Huddle
are just two of the many small res-
taurants in the Davidson area.
Next week the Lake House Res-

taurant and Cashion’s Deli will be
reviewed.
