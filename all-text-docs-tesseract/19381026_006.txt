American people, to the exclusion
of their duties and obligations.
Again the leadersS6f the country
stood “with their backs to the

the Civil War followed.

With the close of the Civil War,
the idea of educating thg masses
came to the front, and the teacher
became the leader in America. His
doctrines, however, were based on
the scientific principles, pre-
valent in Germany. They regarded
the Bible stories as mere allegories
and looked only for scientific ex-
planations of creation. These men
tried establish peace on
earth by force, not by love. Again
the leaders stood “with their backs
toward the temple of the Lord,”
and the World War followed.

Today, the business man is the
leader of the American people.
What the effect of his leadership
will be, knows. He will,
however, have to modify his prin-
ciple of “profit at any cost” if this

him from every man, and
with this, he can do great things;
however, our individual personali-
ties are of no use without a Chris-
tian personality which we should
try to develop as’ much as pos-
sible.

Finally, Bishop Pfohl concluded
with this thought: “To take what
we have and are, to dedicate it to
Him and His Service on behalf of
our feHowmen, and to use it all in

other

His service—that is the supreme
purpose.”

relieves the distress.

THEN —to make its long-continued
action last even longer, spread a thick
layer of VapoRub on the chest and
cover with a warmed cloth.

LONG AFTER sleep comes, VapoRub
