valve system will be installed‘in
Cannon Dorm next year which
should enable students to regu-

Meetze said. ‘‘This should even
out the temperature and will
keep people from burning up.”’

In other attempts to con-
serve, the Physical Plant is
decreasing wattage in lighting
throughout the campus in order
to cut back on lighting costs.
However there are limits to
what can be cut especially in
buildings like the Library where

We don’t need to go to war in

that the Soviet Union threatens

a paranoid leader. Our Jeaders

However, alumni giving is

“not that good,” Dittman said.
Last year, only 27% of David-
son alumni gave to the annual

fund. The average gift was $92.

A recent survey of 66 major

private universities in The
Chronicle of Higher Education

indicated that the percentage of
alumni who give ranges from
3.2% to 56% and the average
amount given from $13.47 to
$333.58.
