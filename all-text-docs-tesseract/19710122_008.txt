———— ‘Mixed Feelings’

Honors College Weathers -
First Term’ S Puzzlements,

By GRAY’ WILSON
Asst: Managing Editor

It appears that the Honors
College has established it-
self after weathering its
first term at Davidson.

Dean of the Honors Col-
lege Frontis W. Johnston be-
lieves the program is now
settled “On campus_ even
though it has yet to live up
to all his expectations.

‘‘I_ have—mixed_feelings,”’
Johnston said. ‘‘We have
had a little foot-dragging. I
certainly don't think we
have achieved everything,
but we have a good start.
What we need is more pro-
fessors to expand the pro-
gram.”

So far no one has been
dropped from: the program,
although one student with-
drew voluntarily.

Five more students enter-
ed tHe program at the be-

ginning of tiie winter term,
raising the number of parti-
cipants to a total of 28

members. Among this new:
addition are three sopho-,

mores, a-junior, and for the
first time a freshman.

Three of the honors stu-
dents are. abroad this. year
and one other is now study-
ing at Pomona, leaving 24
honors students on this cam-
pus.

A freshman student has
yet to begin college here
completely on an _ honors
program, ‘but Johnston stat-
ed that ‘‘such a situation is
theoretically possible. We
‘still have to work out the
interview, but the program
is open to any entering stu-
dent."’

At the “beginning of the

winter term, all honors stu-

dents received a letter warn-
ing that unless at least one
honors grade was achieved

euch term, either on bee
pendent study or in the re-

. gular curriculum, students
may ‘be subject to expulsion .

from the program.

A complaint was filed by
Danny Clodfelter, question-
ing the vague nature of the
letter with respect to adjust-
ing standards to each indi-
vidual.

According to Clodfelter, ‘‘I
think —it~-would—be—nice—to

have every , student doing
ngs work, but I don’t
think -it should be applied

across the board.

“The problem is in trans-
lating honors standards into
grades for a record for part
of graduate work.”’

’ Clodfelter added that John-
ston explained to him that
the text. of the letter was
meant to be ‘‘flexible’’ in
its application.

“It was not meant as a
threat,’’ Johnston said ‘‘We
are saying that we _ think
everybody ought to be doing
his work on a quality level.
This is to say that the
Honors College is not a
place where there are no
standards.”’

Johnston: invited student
comment on the letter
through a_ general session,
and he noted that students
are likewise urged to evalu-

ate their faculty advisors.

..- Cornell

(edntinoad -From Page 3)
There are other people as-
sociated with Davidson be-
cause of the church,’’ he
said.

Cornell also discounted the
impact of coeducation on
college fund raising. ‘‘The
key’ question here is not
whether it is economically
advantageous to be coed or
not ‘but academics:'’ He
stressed that people can be
found who will contribute to
either type of system in
about equal numbers.

Finally he commented on
the effect of contributors
who objected to certain
changifig trends at David-
son or other colleges. ‘‘By
and large in college you will
find that the people that are
loyal to the college will con-

tinue to support it. The vo-
ciferous critics in the wings
are probably those who have
given little or no support to
the college through the
years,’ he said.

Cornell made further com-
ments about the general
problem of supporting a
funding programs at a small
college such as Davidson
when talking to large foun-
dations.

Support is based on inno-
vation which he feels is
strong here at Davidson he
said. “It’s very easy for a
development. department to
support programs coming
out of an academic depart-
ment where the proposals
are innovative and _ crea-
tive.”’
