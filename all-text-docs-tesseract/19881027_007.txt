playwright’s style. “Horton Foote is an
‘actor’s playwright,’” Barber said. “He
does not write everything. His scripts are
almost skeletal, leaving most things out for
the actors to flesh out.”

The cast devoted the first few weeks of
rehearsal to simply reading through and
discussing the script. Through the discus-
sions they. began to understand the mind-
set of the World War I era and the impact of
the year’s domestic flu epidemic, which
killed more than 20 million people world-
wide. One of Barber’s production strate-
gies was an invitation to Davidson doctor
Bill Williams to explain to the cast the
terrible impact of epidemics in days prior

to drugs such as penicillin or sulfa.

It was also challenging for Barber to help
students understand the attitudes“of the
times. “Warfare was romanticized. The
country really never knew how horrible
trench warfare was because those who re-
turned seemed to have an unwritten pact
not to dispel romantic visions of the ‘Great
War.’

“Patriotism ran deep during World War
I. On every available spot one saw posters
urging Americans to ‘Buy Liberty Bonds.’
Woodrow Wilson led America out of isola-
tionism into the war with enthusiasm. By
1918, America was the protector of the free
world, Even the songs of the era were
wildly patriotic with-titles like ‘America
Here’s My Son’ and ‘Over There.’ This
was a singing war.”

Period clothing was not as foreign for the
actors. The war changed women’s dress
drastically between 1916 and 1918, but
adjusting to period costumes was not diffi-
cult. “Skirts were way above the ankle,”
Barber said, “so we didn’t have to teach the
women to walk in hoop skirts. Corsets were
out of style.”

Horton Foote has made a name for him-
self primarily through his screenplays To
Kill a Mockingbird and Tender Mercies. In
the preface to a collection of Foote’s plays,
Reynolds Price calls him “one of the major
playwrights of our time. who has not been
fully recognized.” Commonweal’s Marian
Burkhart claims that Foote may be Amer-
ica’s greatest playwright.

1918 is one of a nine-play circle writte:
about Foote’s family. Foote’s forte is char-

acterization. The set was designed by pro-
fessor Joe Gardner, who has also designed
portable sets for the Charlotte Repertory
productions this year in Charlotte and
Davidson.

1918 will play October 27-29 in Hodson
Hall of the Cunningham Fine Arts Building
at Davidson College. It begins at 7:30 p.m.
on October 27 and 8 p.m. on all other
nights. General admission is $5, and $3 for
students and senior citizens.
