Senate’s resolution, and some of
its features could be implemen-
ted as soon as this winter’s
exam period. SGA President
Bruce Brown said the most
easily implemented changes
would be the first four described
above.

Another platform of the reso-
lution is that the faculty’s
deadline for turning in grades
be extended, with the exception
of senior grades during the
spring term.

History professor David Shi,
who last week initiated the

‘faculty petition to establish a
dual system of exams in which
each professor had the option of
either scheduling or not schedu-
ling a final exam, reiterated at
the forum the fact that the

‘Gang of Eleven’s’’ proposal
did not intend to abolish self-
scheduled exams.

“IT have never argued that
(the honor system and self-
scheduled exams) are seperate;
I’ve always acknowledged in
my public statements that I
believe they are indeed related,
very closely related, but not
mutually dependent,”’ Shi said.

Philosophy professor John
Young contended that ‘‘self-
scheduled exams are symbolic
of the integrity of the honor
code.’’

“My concern about self-sche-
duled exams is simply this: that
the way they are structured
now, they do not allow the
honor system to work according
to its stated function,’’ Shi
added. This is because, he later
said, ‘‘it is very difficult for a
student or a faculty member to
know what is going on in this
building during an exam peri-
od.”

Shi said he would approve of
some regulated, formalized
guidelines in the self-scheduled
exam procedure to eliminate
confusion and ambiguity. ‘‘I
like it,’’ he said of the Senate
resolution.

But Shi’s personal concern
extends beyond the scope of
self-scheduled exams, he indica-
ted. “There are students here
who are not willing to shoulder

the burdén of the honor system;
that is, they are not willing to
turn in those who they see
cheating; stealing, lying, etc. . .
The system, then, is not func-
tioning as it should,’’ he said.
But Philosophy professor Ro-

bert Maydole said that al-
though he has the right to
structure his course as he
pleases, he does not have the
right.“‘to act as jury, or judge,
or hangman in cases of chea-
ting.”

This, he said, is the role of the
Honor Council; his duty is only
to adhere to the approved
system. He explained he does
not, have the right to give a
scheduled exam if he suspects a
great deal of cheating on cam-
pus. ,

Dean of Students Will Terry
also acknowledged that “it is
hot the professor’s job to propa-
gandize the honor system.”

Hans Watford, a student
solicitor, said he wanted to
reassure students and faculty
that the honor system is wor-
king. ‘There is cheating, but

these lasc iS BLL IE SOE
Senior Glen Darbyshire called
himself the “student skeptic’’ of
the current exam system, al-

though he said he is reluctant to’

have scheduled exams yet.

The honor code can be effec-
tively enforced, and the benefits
gained from operating on the
current system, such as moral
growth, self-confidence, and
convenience and flexibility,
must be weighed in light of the
negative features of the system,
according to Darbyshire.

Under the self-scheduled sy-
stem, honest students can be
compared to dishonest: ones by
a professor, he pointed out.
Under a system of scheduled
exams, however, he said he did
not fear losing the opportunity
for moral growth.

Psychology professor John
Kello acknowledged that, if
approached, he ‘‘would have
been able to sign’’ the proposal
that was circulated among the
faculty last week.

‘However, in faculty debate
over the proposal, the message
I got from its supporters was
quite different (from the propo-
sal itself), namely too many
students will cheat and do cheat
on_self-scheduled exams—the
temptation is simply too great.
The self-scheduling system un-
duly strains the honor code, it
evades the honor code. It
should therefore be disconti-
nued. That I do not endorse,”
Kello said.

During the question and an-
swer period that followed the
faculty and student talks, ju-
nior Tommy Thompson sugges-
ted that as part of an effort to
remind students of their respon-
sibility to ensure the smooth
operation of self-scheduled e-
xams, each professor should
address the subject in class near
the beginning of each exam
period.

But Dean of Students Will
Terry emphasized strongly that
students must remind students
of this responsibility. ‘‘Be sure
in your own conscience and in
your own mind that you are
willing to report violations of
the honor system before you
make wild affirmations of your
loyalty to it,"’ Terry challenged
the student body.

“The honor system ‘is funda-
mentally a student system. I
certainly think a,faculty mem-
ber who does not believe in the
honor system at Davidson. I
have real questions whetner
they should remain in this
community,’’ Terry continued.

- He concluded by saying, ‘My
concern, however, finally, is not
whether the exams are schedu-
led, unscheduled, taken in the
bedroom or bathroom, but that
the honor system at Davidson
stands firm, because that’s the
most important thing we’ve
got,”’ Terry concluded.

pus ministry points out that “‘if
it is successful, the ministry to
students will be undertaken not
just by one man but by a
minister backed by the coopera-
tion and help of an entire
congregation.”

Rush’s job is one of heavy
demands. Responsible to the
session, he is fully a part of the
church as a town institution,
going beyond the strict realm of
Davidson College. His salary
funded largely by Davidson,
Rush is fully a part of the
college and its life. Rush is an
intimate advisor to the Y and
has a vital interest in its service
projects. The Tuesday night
Worship is one of his responsi-
bilities and one of the most
concrete examples of the conti-
nuing relationship between the
students and the congregation.
The last eighteen months have
been especially trying for Rush

Minister.

Drama workshop

By JEAN SORACCO
Asst. Features Editor

Presented this week by
Drama Workshop III will be the
plays ‘Apollo of Bellac’’ and
‘Hello Out There.*’ The last
plays to be performed on cam-
pus this term, they will be
held in the workshop theater.

This theater creates different
dramatic experiences for the
audience and gives variety to
the plays. These two plays will
be in the round, a technique
which allows the audience to be
“in the scene” and to feel most
involved.

Lyman Collins will direct the
first play, ‘Apollo of Bellac”

written by Jean Girandoux,
who also wrote ‘‘The Madwo-
man of Chaillot.”’

‘‘Apollo of Bellac’’ is the
story of a girl who comes
looking for a job in a large
bureaucracy but is afraid of
men. She meets a mysterious
character, the Man of Bellac,
who tells her the secret of
getting along with men.

The secret is to tell a man
that he is beautiful. The events
of the play start when she cops:
the secret.

College, in a suburb of Philadel-

gives its professors the option
of scheduling or not scheduling

take-home examinations, pa-

no exam at all.

Painter emphasized the role
of Bryn Mawr’s honor code in
the un-proctored process, and
noted that ‘The only reason
why this particular system
works is students."’

Williams College, a small but
prestigious school in Williams-

the same options as Bryn Mawr
does, yet with different results.

“The play has the universal
theme that beauty is every-
thing,’’ said Lyman. ‘‘I am
emphasizing the universality by
setting the play in no specific
time or place.”

“The play is rather sexist,
but the main theme is to accept
life for what it is and to accept
the beauty of every day.”
~ One of the best descriptions
of the play is a quote by Brooks
Adkinson, “‘a little gem of ironic
humor.” :

The cast includes Laurie
Campbell as Agnes; Nelson

Andy Miller as the receptionist;
