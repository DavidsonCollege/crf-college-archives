Frank shows coaches_.

that they missed out

By Erik SWANSON
Senior Staff Writer

After learning that she had been named to
the American Lacrosse Conference
Preseason All-Conference Team earlier this
semester, Lindsay Frank ’05 felt a sense of
satisfaction in having proved herself so capa-
bly to the coaches who once passed on her.

Frank’s nomination to the All-Conference

team, which included
players from elite
teams such as
Northwestern, Penn
State and Johns
Hopkins, among oth-
ers, was the result of a
poll of the league’s
coaches, many of
whom she had once
spoken to in her col-
lege search.

“I was pleasantly
surprised,” said Frank.
“It was the coaches. (==
who voted, and they |
were all coaches I had
talked to when I was ;
looking at schools.
They had all said, ‘We
like you, but we have
other people in mind,’
so it was nice to get the
recognition after play-
ing for four years, and
especially for a program that hasn’t done as
well and improved as quickly as their pro-
grams have. It was really exciting and flatter-
ing in that way, especially.”

Frank ’05 has fueled the ’Cats’ attack.

But while thankful for the individual
recognition, Frank points to a renewed
emphasis on the team concept as a ‘key dif-
ference in the team’s results and performanc-
es since the 1-15 season two years ago.

“I definitely think we’ve grown, and I
don’t think our record necessarily shows it,”
she said. “We’re a different team now,
because we all play for each - other.
Regardless of the outcome, we go out every
game and we know
what we’re playing for.
We’ve lost a lot of
games this season, but
even after the games,
we can still joke around
on the bus. We’re not
pointing fingers, and
we’re not blaming any-
one but ourselves. We
don’t mix up lacrosse in
our friendship, so even
though we’re not win-
ning, it’s been a much
better experience.”

Despite the focus on
the team as a whole,
Frank’s impressive
individual performanc-
es ovér the last two sea-
sons are difficult to
ignore. Frank’s presea-
son honor stemmed
from her breakout sea-
son last year, when she
ranked second on the team in goals scored,
tied for first in total points and first in ground
