THE DAVIDSONIAN

Women’s soccer
can’t score a win

FRoM STAFF REPORTS

The women’s soccer team is
in the midst of a mini-slump, but
it’s a slump against some of the
best soccer teams in the South.

WOMEN’S
SOCCER

Aftera 1-Ohome loss Wednes-
day against Georgia, the Wildcats
lost 2-1’ at UNCG Friday night
before dropping a 2-0 game to
Florida Sunday afternoon at home.

“We need a lot of chances to
score,” coach Kevin Hundley said.
“And it’s just difficult to create a
lot of quality scoring chances
against these types of teams.”

Those three losses, however,
followed a win Sunday at home

against Georgia Southern to open
the conference season. .

The Wildcats (2-4-1) will now
have a long week of practice be-
fore traveling to Charleston South-
ern Saturday afternoon. They then
return to conference play with a
game at Appalachian State next
Wednesday.

“The schedule will start get-

ting kinder now,” Hundley said. —

“We need to regroup and refocus.
... We’ve chosen to play the best
teams in the region. We could have
playeda weaker schedule, but that’s
not what I wanted to do and that’s
not what (the players) wanted to
do.” Saturday against Charleston
Southern, the team will try to get
its offense going again.

Amy Kanoff scored the team’s
only goal of the week Friday against
UNCG on a 20-yard kick in the
first half. In that game, Davidson
was outshot 22-2 after being

ground vs. Sewanee. The Cats
also sported two of the top four I-
AA interception leaders, in senior
linebacker Will Robinson and
freshman free safety Dan Dearing,
each of them having picked two
passes last week.

Maryville, perhaps still frus-
trated by their failure last week
against North Greenville, foiled
Davidson’ s initial strategy, putting
together an awesome drive to start
the game. Seven straight runs by
quarterback Brandon Derrick (15
rushes for 84 yards and 4-for-7
passing for 48 more, along with 2
TD passes and one scoring run)
and tailback Jason Norris advanced
the ball to the Davidson 5-yard
line, where Derrick hooked up with
tight end Tony Shuler, giving
Maryville a quick 7-0 advantage in
dominant fashion less than four
minutes into the game.

Undaunted, Davidson fought
right back, creating an impressive
drive of their own, highlighted bvy
a 15-yard connection from Wild-
cat quarterback Tommy Dugan to
freshman tight end Wesley Jones.

However, the promising push con-
cluded abruptly when Dugan’ pass
was was tipped at the line of scrim-
mage and intercepted by Scot de-
fensive back Chad Johnson at the
Maryville 7.

The defense, although allow-
ing a rather hefty 274 yards rush-
ing, made some big plays, keeping
the Scots from putting the contest
out of reach early. Outstanding
individual performances were
turned in by senior captains Bo
Bartholemew (5 takles), James
Cassidy (7), and Will Robinson
(5). Sophomore linebackers Chris
Hess and Gray Broughton pitched
in as welll registering 8 and 7
takedowns, respectively. And last,
but certainly not least, the out-
standing freshmen Dearing (11
tackles) and Ben Spivey (11 mon-
strous hits and one fumble recov-
ery) were both immense on the
devensive front.

But that was not enough to
capture a second win. Landis at-
tributed some of the muffs to the

slick weather (parts of the game

were played in monsoon-like
downpours), but at the same time
lauded the Scots effort. “Pay re-
spect to Maryville, they were a
great team, they did what they had
to do.”

“Hopefully we’ll be able to
take our frustrations out Saturday
on Charleston Southern,” Hundley
said.

Asked if he thought his play-
ers were getting a little down after
three straight losses, Hundley said,
“T hope they are a little. But I also
hope they realize that we’re better

than this and we’ re capable of be-
ing a very good team.”

The Wildcats don’t return

Rugby drops one in the muck

Davidson rugby travelled to
Boone on Saturday for an intense
fight with Appalachian State. In
the first match, the Mountaineers
narrowly tipped the Wildcats 17-

the second game:14-0, -

“We were really anxious to
get the first game started, because
we were all cold, wet and ready to
kick the hell of Appalachian State,”

however, the Wildcats came out
strong. Shortly after Matt
Burkhardt converted a three-point
penalty kick, Jason Cody, a first-
year wing, took a pass from Seth
Carpenter, another first-year
player, and scored the first five-
point try of the day. Burkhardt
made the kick-after, giving the
Wildcats a 10-0 lead. ;

“Scoring that first try gave us
momentum and we used that to our
advantage,” flanker Chris Smith
said. The Wildcats used this mo-
mentum to play solid defense and
kept their 10-point lead into the
second half. :

.In the second half, however,
the Wildcats gave up 18 points

to 10-7.

Shortly after, the Mountain-
eers, capitalizing on mistakes by
the Wildcats, mostly caused by the
ever-increasing rain, scored their
second try which put them into the
lead with about 10 minutes left.

Long gave the Wildcats life
when he dove on a ball in the try
zone amidst many Mountaineers,
giving the Wildcats a 15-12 lead.
With three minutes left, however,
a Mountaineer wing slid into the
try zone on the weak side for the
deciding score. Said Mike Ingram:

cially after playing such a good
game. Iam disappointed and I think
