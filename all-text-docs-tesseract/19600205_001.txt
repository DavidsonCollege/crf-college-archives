“We have a

lems in a building such as this
after the trip,” said Currie. The |
auditorium, with its accompany-
ing difficulties, is the greatest |
obstacle in plans for the new
Fine Arts Center. |

Using an adaptation of the_
“stage-wagon” principle, the)
architect has drawn up’ a plan’
including a separate stage for
dramaties which could be drawn
onto a recital-hall platform.
When not in use, this dramatic |
stage would be wheeled into a
separate room for rehearsal |
purposes. The recital-hall stage |
would be more open, providing |
better facilities for concerts|
and musical performances. |

Present preliminary plans call
for the two-story auditorium to
occupy the center of the pro-|
posed building. Designed to har- |
monize with the other smaller,
buildings in the quadrangle,
the wings of the- building will)
be one story in height.

Endowment Drive

The 1959 Living Endowment
program received $162,231. ac-
cording to an audit taken at the
close of the drive Dec. 31. The
total fell short of the goal of
$175,000 but showed a marked
increase over the record-break-
ing 1958 result of $156,662.

Alumni, parents, corporations,
and friends of the college con-
tributed to bring the fund closer
to its eventual goal of $200,000
each year. There was a small
increase in the alumni partici-
pation from 29.1% to 31.3%.
Alumni gifts accounted for)
$91,846 of the total, and cor-
porations and foundations con-|
tributed $54,306. |

gress of the Fund have <been)
made to agents and regional |
chairmen. A detailed report on |

Lord Will Appea
As Duke Organist

Robert Sutherland Lord, or-
ganist and assistant professor
of music, will be the guest
organist on the current Duke
University Chapel series at 4
p-m., Sunday, February 7.

Professor Lord, newly ap-
pointed organist and choirmas-
ter for Charlotte’s Selwyn Ave-
nue Presbyterian Church, pre-
sented a recital in the M.LT.
Chapel at Harvard University
during the Christmas holidays.

At Duke University, Mr. Lord
has chosen a program of early
15th and 16th Century keyboard
literature, many of which he
himself transcribed for organ.
Works of Johann Sebastian
Bach, Clerambault, and Lubeck
will also be played. “Three
Modal Pieces” written in 1956
by Jean Langlais, contemporary
French organist, will conclude
the recital. Lord, who studied
in Paris with the famous blind
composer, had the honor of in-
troducing these modal selec-
tions last year in this country.

Lord opened the Davidson
College organ series recently in
Davidson and was followed by
Paul Jenkins of Stetson Uni-

In past years, the Student
Council has discussed a new

ruling. Council President Green,

pointed out that for several
years it has been customary for
the council to recommend that
a convicted person be consid-
ered for readmission if the pres-
ent permanent expulsion ruling
were amended.

“I personally feel that a lib-
eralization of the rule is in ac-
cord with the Christian attitude
that is Davidson's heritage,”
Green continued. “It is only
