‘“Wall was not only a good man,

By Mary CLARE JALONICK
Editor Emerita

At E. Craig Wall Jr.’s funeral
March 7, John Kuykendall deliv-
ered the eulogy. The two graduated
together in the Davidson Class of
1959, and they led the College to-
gether beginning in 1988 as the
President and Chairman of the Board
of Trustees, respectively. They
knew each other well, and
Kuykendall’s words, according to
Spanish professor Magdalena Maiz-
Pena, who attended the funeral, “ex-
pressed what we were all feeling.”

Kuykendall’s love for Wall was
evident: “Craig Wall was a good
and gentle man who tried always to
put the spotlight on other people as
he was doing things for the welfare
of all,” he said. “He was a wonder-
ful role model anda personification
of all the good things we try to
promote at Davidson.”

Everyane who knew Wall says
the same things. He was kind and
generous, and he loved Davidson.

“He carried a lot of Davidson
around with him in his head. It will
take time for any of the other trust-
ees to grasp that,” says Dean of
Faculty and Vice President of Aca-
demic Affairs Robert Williams. —

Mathematics professor Ben
Klein, who serves on the presiden-
tial search committee, says that his
devotion was unusual. “If you had
to use one word to describe him, it
would certainly be loyalty. It’s
hard to imagine a more loyal alum-
nus than he was.._He was a tireless

worker to the College, ‘and to him
the College was not an abstract
institution— it was the people that
he was concerned about.”

Former SGA President Bill
Gullan agrees. “What shone
through whenever I was in his pres-
ence was his love for Davidson. ”

“Davidson trains students for
leadership and service,” says Vice
President for Business and Finance
Robert Norfleet. “I don’t know
anyone who exemplifies that more
than Craig Wall.”

As the Chairman of the Board,
they all say, he was thoughtful and
unimposing.

from me,” he says.

Gullan was impressed by his
respect for the student body. “He
bent. over backward to accommo-
date student requests to be involved
in things.”

“Craig was careful not to
micromanage, but he was always
willing to advise and share the bur-
den,” says President Kuykendall.

all times, maintaining a list of cam-

wanted to be there and to be of
assistance. There wasn’t an area
that he was not involved in some
way.”

Norfleet says that the school is
“indebted to him in ways that we
cannot understand. We can never
fully appreciate the leadership until
the gap is there.”

Klein was impressed by Wall’s

- modesty. “He never wanted to hog

the limelight. He was mighty gen-
erous [with his own money], but he
was also tireless in soliciting funds
from other people for the College.”

The College was the benefi-
ciary of much of Wall's generosity.
Often, Wall wouldn't accept recog-
nition for his gifts, donating them
anonymously.

contributions,” says President
Kuykendall, “he made small gifts
for just about every new memorial
fund established here as a show of
respect for the individuals they hon-
ored.”

Wall was involved in seem-
ingly innumerable organizations.
Klein says the extent to which he
was involved is “staggering. And
he was really a major player — he
wasn’t just signed on so they could

that with everything else that he
did.”

Trustee Larry Dagenhart says
that Wall was a “wonderful, gentle
and kind person who took the time
to reach out to people — very unself-
ish. The last time I saw him he was
so proud and happy because his son
Ben had gotten to the wrestling fi-
nals, and no one had done that since
1968.”

use his name. He was a force for
good on a scale that most of us
could only dream of. I’ve never met
anyone who did so many different
kinds of good works.”

Above all, they say, Wall was a
good man. “He was a terrific guy,”
says Klein. “It’s such a shock that
he’s gone. He was so quiet and
unassuming, people sometimes
don’t know how important he was.”

Senior Will Cowan is a good
family friend of the Wall family

and has known Wall for most of his
life. “As I started getting older I
realized how influential he was and
he still had time to speak with me,”
he says. “The thing that was most
impressive to me about Mr. Wall,”
says Cowan, “besides the fact that
he was incredible business influ-
ence in our community, was the
incredible time that he spent with
family and friends. In high school,
he helped me with my Eagle Scout
project of painting a church rectory

plies that I needed for it, as well as

that Wall took to spend with his
family. “He was very involved in
the academics and athletics of his
children,” he says.

Professor Magdalena Maiz-
Pena, who had both of Wall’s sons
in class, says “he had very personal
gestures. He always found a way to
write a personal note or express
gratitude. I was able to see how
committed he was to the idea of an

integral education and the DOK...
tance of educating your mind, spirit

and heart at same time. I saw him
apply that to his son and students at
Davidson. He was a caring and
loving father.”

“Who he is and what he does
were always in congruence,” says
Norfleet. “He was utterly selfless.
For aman with such obvious wealth,
you would never have known it.”

“Craig always had a wonder-
fully warm sense of humor,” says
Bethea. “He didn’t only laugh with
others, but at himself as well. I
think that anyone who can do that
has a lot of strength, says Bethea.

Cowan says Wall’s funeral was
“amazing. There were around 800
people there. The church was en-
tirely full an hour and a half before.
It was a strong tribute he had so
many friends in so many facets of
his life. He did so much for so many
people.”

Williams sums it up: “Craig
Wall was a person of great energy
and ability. who truly loved
Davidson College. He embodied
business acumen, religious convic-
tion, respect for the academy, and.a
concern for others. He lived a life
based on what William James once
called the three most important val-
ues — kindness, kindness, and kind-
ness. We miss him terribly.”

“We will miss him as one of the
great leaders of Davidson,” says
Dagenhart.

“When I walk around campus,”
says Bethea, “I can just see Craig
standing with his arms folded watch-
ing a soccer game, or students, or
talking to faculty. He was thor-
oughly engaged.”

Cowan says _ President
Kuykendall’s eulogy said it well.
“He emphasized that Wall was not
only a good man, but a great man.”
