for several minutes.

The main speeches of the evening were
made by Dr. J. M. McConnell, Prof. Bail-
ey, and Dr. Rowan, general president of
the Alumni Association. Dr. McConnell
expressed his appreciation at being pres-
ent and urged the class to work on to
better things. Prof. Bailey also urged the
class to work on to higher things, and
have something: definite to work on.
Several members of the class expressed
their approval of Prof. Bailey’s sugges-
tion, and the general spirit’ of the class
seemed to indicate that the plan met the
approval of all present, and that some-
thing definite would be taken up and
worked out by the class.

Dr. Rowan’s address came as the cli-
max of the occasion. His address was
inspiring and educational and at the same
time contained enough humor to make it
unusually interesting,

Between numbers on the program, the
class and visitors were entertained by a
quartet made up of four members of the
class, and by some special music given by
other members of the class. The spirit
shown during the evening was exception-
ally fine and worthy of Davidson men. A
feeling of brotherhood and of common
interest was worked up, and a desire and
determination to make the class of "29
even more worthy of Davidson was in-
stilled in the hearts of all those present.

In conclusion, the class rose in a body
and sang, O Davidson.

The banquet was followed by a theatre
party. 3
