Pep Meeting

A mammoth pep meeting, in-
cluding yells, songs, speeches, a
bonfire and a shirt-tail parade,
will be staged Friday night at
7:30 as a part of the Homecom-
ing program.

“Since the crowd should be a
very large one, the meeting will
be held outside in front of Cham-
bers,” stated Joe Shelton, head
cheer leader. “Everyone, fresh-
men, upperclassmen and alumni,
are urged to come and bring
their dates. We want to show the
best spirit that has been heard
of at Davidson.”

The bonfire and shirt-tail pa-
rade will be on the freshman
field. The cheer leaders are plan-
ning to burn in effigy the Cen-
