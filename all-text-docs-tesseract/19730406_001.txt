Contributing Editor
Representatives of the
student body. faculty, ad-
ministration, Board of

Trustees, alumni. and Wildcat
Fund discussed the athletic

program at Davidson in a
meeting at Montreat last

“The purpose of the

meeting,’ student represen-
tative Steve Bell said, ‘‘was to
consider the scope of athletic
policies the trustees should
establish, with special attention
given to subsidized athletics.”

Scott Seeks
SC Position

By ALEC HOON
Editor-in-Chief

Vice President tor Acadenne
Attairs John Mo Bevan con-
firmed Tuesday that Tom scott
will remain oat) Davidson as
Athlete Director for at) least
one more year. he ts not selec-
ted to become the new Southern
Conterence commissioner.

“The tinal decision on the
commissioner will be made
sometime in May. Tom scott is
presently one of the persons
beng considered.” Bevan in-
dicated

“At the cud ot next vear, scott
will retire as athletic director. i
he is not selected as the com-
missioner this spring, and anew
director pieked.” he said

Bevan stated that no further

plans can be made until thé
southern Conlerence picks a
New comiisstoner

With regard to the return of
Tom Stevens, who is presently
at the University of Alabama
working on his) doctorate in
Physical Education, Bevan
said, “‘We have a contract for
Stevens to return in the same
capaculy as he was when he lett,
be. to help with the physical
education progran: and to
coach swimming and baseball.’

In May, the trustees will
make a decision on the future
athletic policy based on the
recommendation of the Trustee
Athletic Committee.

Football and basketball, the
only two subsidized sports, will
receive the most attention.

The representatives at Mon-
treat discussed the future level
of subsidy of these two sports
and, in fact, considered whether
or not either one should be de-
subsidized.

For the fiscal year 1972-1973
the difference between income
and expenses is estimated to be
approximately $160,000 in the
football program. The deficit in
basketball is estimated to be ap-
proximately $140,000.

The expense of the football
program has come under more
frequent attack because the
team usually posts a poorer
won-lost record, and thus is said
to bring less prestige to David-
son, than does the basketball
team.

A lot of the students just try
to laugh off the football
program.” said SGA President
Bo Phillips, who briefly presen-
ted student sentiment at the
meeting.

“There is a lot more support
for the football team, as friends
and fellow students, than there
is for the football program,” he
said.

“On the other hand, students
have higher expectations for
the basketball team,” he added.

**My own position,”’ Phillips
said, ‘is that no sports should
be subsidized except basket-
ball. Enthusiasm would be just
as high for a _ non-subsidized
football program. I justify sub-
sidized basketball by pointing to
the greater potential in areas of
public relations and student en-
joyment."’

Bell agreed with Phillips on
de-subsidizing football. ‘‘I don't
think a student should get a full
athletic grant because he can
throw a football. Football
players should be given no
special consideration."

‘Priorities at Davidson are
somewhat distorted. Subsidized
football is near the bottom of
my list. The situation now is

Senate Refuses Funds
While Student Car Stalls

By BETSY ALEXANDER
Coutributing Editor

The elusive student car is flut-
tering on the brink of extinction,
caught between its opponents in
the Senate and its proponents in
the administration.

Since December, the proposal
for a student car has been in a
special Senate committee,
chaired by Bill Meier. It is the
committee’s job to determine
how the car would be used and
who would vet priority for its
use.

Once this is done, and if the
Senate passes the resulting bill,
the administration can act to
abtain the car.

According to Vice President
for Academic Affairs John M.
Bevan, the adminisiration
stands ready to put up its part of
the finances as soonas the Senate
appropriates its share of the
cost from student funds. “I'm
waiting to hear from the
Senate.”

President of the SGA Bo
Phillips, how ever, would prefer
to see the whole matter dropped
because difficulties with  in-
surance and priority would
greatly limit the number of
students who could use the car.

The proposal for a student car
was last on a list of demands
from the Black Student
Coalition.

“All of the demands, except
for the car, have been met,”
said Bevans, ‘and this is the
one that I thought would be
easiest to meet because it was
something for the entire student
body.”

Although recently surfaced,
the clamor for a student car is
not new. Two years ago one did
exist in the form of a 1963 Buick,
but’ problems with insurance
made the car aloof from students
and virtually unattainable, It
finally went the way of all vin-
lage cars into oblivion.

such that the good student from
a middle class family receives
less financial aid than the good
football player from a wealthy
family,” he said.

“Is the football program wor-
th a $160 per year to each
student at Davidson?” Bell
queried.

Bell cited the benefits of a de-
subsidized program at David-
son, ‘‘the program would be less
expensive, interest would be
greater because the team would
be more competitive in a de-
subsidized conference, and with
greater interest there would
probably be more income,
although the team itself would
no longer reflect the semi-
professionalism we now have.
The football program would be
open to more students."

Bell, however, had mixed
feelings about the basketball
program. “‘It is less of an issue
economically.’ he — said,
‘because there is less money
spent on basketball scholar-
ships.""

**Also one must consider the
national stature, student en-
thusiasm, and won-loss records
which the basketball program
has provided.”

In an interview Tuesday.
Director of Student Housing
Scotty Nicholls revealed plans
for changes in next year's
housing.

Freshman coeds will be
housed in Watts dorm and up-
perclass coeds will be staying in
the top two floors of Little dorm
as they are this year.

“Freshman men will be put in
all of Cannon and Richardson
dorms except for the basements
and in the top floors of Sen-
telle."’ explained Mrs. Nicholls.

“The number of floors which
freshmen will occupy in Sen-
telle will be more definite once
we are sure how many fresh-
men have been accepted,” she
added.

“The maximum number of
freshman coeds that can be ac-

cepted is 88 which is the
capacity of Watts. Although it is
possible that the admission of-
fice might not be able to get 88
freshman girls,’' speculated
Nicholls, “‘they can accept
no more than that number."

Further innovations in next
year’s housing are “program
houses” and “room blocks” in
Belk dorm.

Five groups of students have
applied for the two available
houses, Grey House and North
Main House.

One group wants to set up a
“southern regional studies"
program. The program in-
cludes: black studies and moun-
tain folkways.

A second group, an active
Christian group on campus, ap-
plied for one of the houses.

Another proposal is that one
of the houses be reserved for
students returning from Junior
Year Abroad and the Eight
CollegeExchange.. It was
suggested that these students
could then set up programs to
encourage freshmen to par-
ticipate in JYA and the ex-
change.

A group of freshmen in-
terested in German have a bid
for one of the houses with the in-
tention of setting up a German
speaking house. The final
proposal was one made by a
group of students wanting to
“study growth problems with
special attention to economics.
the energy crisis, etc.”

The committee which must
choose two of these groups to
occupy the houses has not vet
made the final decision. Mrs.
Nichoils expressed hope that
the committee would be able to
make a decision at this week's
Meeting.
