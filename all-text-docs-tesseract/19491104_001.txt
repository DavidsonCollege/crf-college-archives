“Experts” fre the curse of our age.
The cross speaks to the heart of
évery man. It delivers you from fear
of death. It removes the fear of
life and makes you want to live

Executive Committee

Bans Hill From Dorm

Wednesday afternoon at 4:30, Mr.
Montgomery S. Hill, Jr., was re-
quired through the action of the
executive committee to leave his
room in Georgia dormitory and to
remain outside this and all other
dormitories until after the Christ-
mas Holidays. Monty was order-
ed to find room elsewhere because
he accidentally scorched a small
place on the floor of his room
while attempting to rid the place of
ants.

On Saturday afternoon of the
Homecoming ‘week end one of
Hill’s roommates in No, 30 Georgia
received a box of cookies from
home. These were placed atop a
table until Sunday afternoon. When
the boys came in at this time they
found the entire box covered with
ants. The floor beneath was black
with the insects also. Hill fired a
small piece of cardboard and at-
tempted to kill a few ants in hopes
of clearing the table and floor.
The ruined cookies were dumped
into the wastebasket and the burn-
inging cardboard was found still
burning on the floor. It was imme-
diately extinguished but left a burnt
spot about one-tenth of an inch
deep and covering an arca of ap.
proximately six square inches.

The janitor discovered the spot
Monday morning while sweeping
and the maintenance department
was informed. Through the chan-
nels the report went until finally
Mr. Hill was called up before Dean
Bailey to explain the matter. Here
at this time the other two occn-
pants of the room were cleared of
suspicion and the blame for burn-
ing Georgia’s deck was laid to Mr.
Hilt. Now this member of ,the jun-
for class is out of his assigned
room for a two-month period, but
the ants are still there!

Women’s College
Invites Students To
Social Science Forum

Dr. Abernathy has received the |

announcement of the annual Har-
riet Elliott Social Science Forum to
be held at the Woman’s College of
‘the University of North Carolina in
Greensboro on November
The topic for the Forum: this year
shall be “The Social Sciences’ What
We Know vs. What We Do.” An
invitation has been extended to all
members of both the student body
and faculty.

‘The courses for and the purposes
of the Forum are best illustrated as
follows: “Society’s failure to turn
to fruitful account the conclusions
formerly grounded on evidence as-
sembled by social investigators, and
the reluctance to reconstruct insti-
tutions on these foundations con-
stitute one of the many dilemmas
of, our time.

“The Forum is directed toward
these goals. It brings together dis-
tinguished social scientists to sur-
vey the state of social knowledge,
to investigate the forces that thwart
its application in. social relationships
on their several levels, and to stim-

wiate the search for policits ands

techniques to solve the dilemma.”

Many famous social scientists
will be present at the Forum. These
include Paul Douglas, U. S. Sena-
tor from Illinois and Professor of
Economics at the University of
Chicago; Louis Hacker, professor

‘ORGANIZATIONS NEED TO TAKE|Photo Club: Invites
INITIATIVE,’ SAYS ABERNETHY Interested Members

Last Tuesday evening representatives from various organiza-
tions on the campus met at the Library with Prof. Abernathy of
the Philosophy Dept. to diseuss the points and highlights. of

North Car. Etchings

Faculty Committée on Fine Arts

Supply of Narcotics Stolen
From White's Drug Store

Last Sunday night White’s Drug
Store was broken into and a quan.
tity of narcotics was stolen.

At about 5 a. m.. Monday morn-
ing, Mr. C. S. Goodrum, owner
and operator of the store, was no-
tified after the Mecklenburg Coun-
ty police, who patrol the town, dis-
covered the robbery.

The front door of the store was
jimmied open and the locked box
containing a supply of narcotics
was broken into,

According to Lt. J. Howard
Payne of the Mecklenburg police,
morphine and codiene were miss-
ing in sizable quantities, but sev.
eral bottles of milder drugs were
not taken.

The case, which is suspected to
be linked up with otherdope ring
activities, has been reported to the
Federal Narcotics Bureau, and an
agent was expected to arrive in
Charlotte sometime during the first
of the week to help local police in
cracking an alleged state-wide dope
ring with headquarters possibly in
Charlotte.

The Davidson robbery is_one of
two which have taken place in the
county in the past 15 days, the

other being at Hoskins Drug Store
on the edge of Chartotte.

Mr. Goodrum said this was the
first time during his 35 years in
the store that his establishment
had been broken into for narcotics.
It had been entered five or six
times before for other. reasons, he
said.

Although dope was the primary
attraction of the thief or” thieves,
a ten-dollar and a fifteen-dollar
fountain pen were missed, and from
$8.00 to $10.00 in change was taken
from the cash register.

County policé made examinations
in the store for the purpose of
securing finger prints.

Chief Stanhope Lineberry of the
Mecklenburg police, has said that
there are indications that Meck-
lenburg County is a main source
of supply for other areas of the
state, including the military veser-

vation at Fort Bragg.

According to information
ceived by the Charlotte Observer,
Federal narcotic agents, the law
enforcement men of the Treasury
Department, apparently’ will re-
open their office in Charlotte. This
office has been closed for the past
three years.

to investigate the forces that thwart
further upon the subjects of their
respective organizations that. were
included in his speech.

The main points of this informal
discussion wére those thal the stu
dents heard in chapel last week and
other comments that the speaker
had planned ta say, but did not
have time for. Dr. Abernathy told
the group that an — organization
should take the, iniative more and
act more forcefully in taking up pro-
jects that it wants to do. One ex-
ample is that if an organization
wants to have a certain speaker, but
is met with opposition towards this
project, it should go ahead with it
regardless of the opposition.

Prof. Abernathy explained that
the lack of maturity in the students
was quite noticeable, because the
activities, functions, and policies of
the various student activity groups
were not of a high standard as they
should be. The appearance of im-
maturity within the whole student
body is diseraceful to the naine of
Davidson. There is such a low level
of maturity that the activities by
the majority of the students are
like to those of high school stu-
dents. The professor went on to
say that there seems io bé no ad-
vancement in’ the men when a
freshman moves on up the ladder,
sv to speak, to become a sophomore
and junior, ete. The quality of the
students’ work among the extra-
curriculat activities is very poor,
one reason heing that the competent
ones for running the various groups
and performing the important jobs
are rot doing this. The competent
students and ones who have little
knowledge eir particular job
are the boys who are actually de.
grading the standard of the extra-
curricular activities of the college.

To summarize, Dr. Abernathy
means that there is/a great need
for improvement and achievement
in the minds of the Davidson stu-
dents. There should be an awaken-
ing among the students to this fact
and also to the fact that the func-
tioning of the extra-curricular ac-
tivities have much room for im-
provement in order to establish a
better name and more respect for
those orgaaéeations.

Prof. Abernathy’s purpose in ex-
pressing his views and opinions on
the many faults and shortcomings
of student gronps is in actuality, a
remedy for this “deplorable” situa-
tion. He mentioned that he hoped
this would arouse opposition among
the students and get them to think-
ing about the true facts of their
own groups. This would most like.
ly create an incentive among the
students to do something about im-

Organized last year by a group
of interested students, the Photo
Club offers a new field in’ extra-
curricular activities to Davidson
students. Efficient darkroom equip-
ment for this club was made possi-
ble through a cash gift to the

Dowd, a former Davidson student.

terested in photography, whether
in the box camera stage or not.

Debate Highlights
Phi Society Program

A debate was the highlight on
the program of Tuesday evening’s
meeting of the Philanthropic Lit-
erary Society. The topic of the de-
bate was: Resolved: “That David-
son Is a Safe Place to Send Your
Son." The affirmative was taken
by Bill Peters and Frank Perrin,
while R. B. Covington and John
Calhoun argued for the negative.
The affirmative contended that
Davidson provides a student with
those fundamentals which make for
a better society. Of special note
are Davidson's outstanding con-
tributions to church and civic life,
taking for example Charlotte, where
there are 42 graduates serving in
the ministry, and 40 are active in
public service. Another important

point brought out by the affirma-

tive was the fact that last year 27

out of 30 prospective medical stu-

dents were accepted into medical
