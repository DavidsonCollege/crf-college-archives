Scott And The Big Stall

ED. MOTE: Sports Editor Russ Merritt is bed-
ridden with e viral infection. His calumn this week is

being written by editor-in-chief Bob Dunham, for-
merly the sports editor of the paper. Merritt will
caturn next week.

Since Big WAYS has not yet named the new

basketball coach, perhaps it would be of interest to
review the selection process as it has slowly developed.

In actuality the selection process started slowly

before gradually tapering off, and at the present _ _

time (unless something drastic has developed in the
last 24 hours? it has come to a complete standstill.

The selective powers have wasted away valuable
time, even to the point of completely destroying Da-
vidson's recruiting power for this year, and thus as-
suring that two years from now the new coach will 2
be talking about “rebuilding years.” ; ;

Sure Tom Seott was right the last time. He waited 2 pam. Golf!
until he found just the right man for the job. But
last lime he could afford to stall, Davidson had just
suffered through 52 straight “rebuilding years.”

This time tie case is different. This time Davicd-

Now that recrubting for next year is at a point of

the mistakes were made.

_ The biggest blow to the Davidson program wis
the loss of both of its very capable assistants. Terry
Holland and Jerry Conboy had dene a great deal for
Wildcat baskethall. They held all of the cards tn this
year’s recruiting hand.

To let Holland and Conboy go was foolish. Both
had proven their ability as coaches and as reerulters,
and both were popular with the team and the college
community. Between them they knew hundreds of
high school prospects by their Grst names. and I dare
say that Scott knows oo more than a handful.

Tho best choice that Scott couid have made from
the available resourees was Holland. A proven coach,
