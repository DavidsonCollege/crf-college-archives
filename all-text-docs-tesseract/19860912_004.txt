IMAC has changed! We couldn’t wait any longer.
Along with North Carolina drinking laws and the new Pat-
terson Court policy on social control, Davidson Intramur-
als have changed!

First of all, we are more organized. We have elected of-
ficers — Jill Boyette, president; Bryan Feigenbaum, vice-
president;.and Mark Crowther, secretary-treasurer. Our
Intramural Athletic Council consists of these officers and

| __ representatives from each fraternity and eating house, inde-

pendents, and freshmen. We have re-written our constitu-
tiom and renewed our committment to IMAC.

In return, we hope that you renew your interest in
IMAC. Even though a majority of students do participate in
intramurals, we want even more participation and a greater
variety of students. Hopefully your enthusiasm will enable
us to expand our program. IMAC hopes to sponsor compe-
tition in other areas such as tennis, swimming, track, and

Volleyball

IMAC

possibly ultimate. frisbee and sailing..Of course we all
know that nothing in life is free (especially if it is fun), so
some entry fees will be required.

The increasing costs of equipment and improvements
have forced us to make another change. Entry fees for the
major IMAC spotts — flickerball, basketball, indoor soc-
cer, softball, street hockey, and volleyball — are non-re-
fundable. This money will be used to supplement the
budget and to purchase t-shirts for championship teams
(sorry, no national TV coverage yet).

The 1986 Davidson Flickerball season will begin on
Sunday, Sept. 28. Rosters will be available at the Athletic
Office on Sept. 12 and they are due on Sept. 19 at 4 p.m.
Keep an eye out for IMAC flyers.
