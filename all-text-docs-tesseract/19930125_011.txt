Artist's Exhibit Depicts

Symbolism for the Self
Crull’s Work Displayed in C hambers

By Chris Hoveland
The Art Department is spon-
soring an exhibit of the New York
artist Ford Crull in the Chambers
Gallery through February 10. Crull

was born in Boston in 1952 and
studied at the University of Wash-
ington. He has exhibited in many
one-man shows in New York and
elsewhere, as well as in group ex-
hibitions. One of his group shows
was the ‘New York Artists'in Mos-
cow” exhibition of 1989 where his
works were seen along with those
of Professor Herb Jackson.

Ford Crull calls himself a
“neo-symbolist.” His style indi-
cates the inflyence of the neo-Ex-

Movi

pressionists of the eighties but also
adopts some of the techniques of
the Surrealists, particularly “‘auto-
matic writing.” A personal (and
indecipherable) symbolic language

interspersed among a forcefully
applied matrix of strokes energizes
his canvases and gives the impres-
sion of a mysteriously organic en-
tity.

In Forms of his Secret Life

' (1982), apiece infour panels, Crull

examines the nature of nis per-
sonal mythology by breaking
through the conflicts within the
psyche. The means of understand-
ing is expression, as if the act itself
is one of healing, a purging of

and urgently digging for his own
history. He drips paint, exposing
an aspect of himself while hiding
another.

Other works such as Self-Por-
trait (1984) use twocanvas panels.
In this particular work, one panel
shows a rough self-portrait while
the other half lacks any central
figure; the familiar matrix of sym-
bols asserts itself with equal weight

Body of Evidence Unimpressive

By Mary McCrory and Will
Lazenby

Welcome back, movie fans.
It’s too early in the semester to do
any real studying yet, so we thought
we'd catch Body of Evidence star-
ring Willem Dafoe, Madonna, Joe
Mantegna, and Anne Archer. The
setting is Portland, Oregon. A
wealthy, older man dies of a heart
attack, and everyone becomes con-
vinced that his younger lover,
played by Madonna, used violent
sex to kill him. The plot thickens
when we realize that he left the
vamp $8 million. Much of-the
movie takes place in the court-
room, where Joe Mantegna and
Willem Dafoe play opposing law-
yers.

Nobody’s going to win an

Oscar here, but Willem Dafoe (Pla-
toon, Mississippi Burning) does a
good job of portraying Madonna’s
sleazy defense lawyer. He is one
of the only things we like about
this movie, actually. The rest of
the film leaves a lot to be desired.
We don’t know which to blame,
the acting or the writing. Joe
Mantegna whines his way through
his part as the D.A. Anne Archer
(Patriot Games, Fatal Attraction)
whimpers through her part as the
conniving secretary.

And then there’s Madonna.
First of all, she doesn’t even look
good. Hercomplexion looks pasty,
and her makeup looks smudged all
the time. On top of that, her acting
is unconvincing and the lines writ-
ten for her are, well, dumb. Even

though she does improve towards
the end itis only a graduation from
bad to mediocre. When she says
things like, “There’s nothing wrong
with admitting you want me,” you
can’t help but cringe because you
really DON’T want her.

Let’s face it, one reason people
will wantto see this is that there are
supposedly such great sex scenes.
Well, hormone junkies, despite the
NC17 rating, there just isn’t that
much going on.

If for some reason you feel
compelled to go see this, it does
offer a minor reward in its interest-
ing ending. Nevertheless, Body of
Evidence isan unimpressive movie.
Go see Aladdin or Scent of a
Woman instead.

1992 was abig year in Nash-

ville, to put it mildly. Country
music has taken over, on the ra-
dio, in the record stores, and.even
ontelevision. The heights of 1991
were, it seems, eclipsed, by the
great achievements in sales and
media attention made by the
Country music industry.

The members of the Baby
Boom generation, seeking some
kind of music:into which they can
sink their teeth, have been left flat
by pop music today. So they have
turned to country, where the new
generation of entertainers has
stepped up the quality of music
and songwriting. The result has
been big.

One of the biggest stories of
1992 involved the advent of one
of the most brilliantly executed
marketing strategies of all time;
Mercury records, with an artistic

thing since the wheel. That splen-

ina long pony tail, complete with

when this was only his first song)
