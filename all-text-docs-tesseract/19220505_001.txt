Metrophilians Defeat the|M
Eumenean-Pandeinics

Dunbar Ogden Takes Medal as Best |

Speaker for the Eumeneans.

The Junior-Senior debate which took
place Thursday evening, April 13, was
won by the men from the Metrophilian
Society. The winning team, which con-
sisted of Tink Taylor, Wooten, and Bur-
ney, upheld the negative side of the
question, Resolved, that the Philippines
should be given complete autonomy at
once. The ‘affirmative speakers were
Henry Patterson and Dunbar Ogden,
from the Eumenean, and W. W. Moore,
from the Pandeinic. In addition to judg-
ing the debate, the judges also decided
which of the affirmative speakers should
receive the Junior-Senior debating medal
given jointly by the Eumenean and Pan-
deinic Societies. This honor was award-
ed to Dunbar Ogden.

The meeting, which was regarded as
a joint program of the four literary so-
cieties, is the only one on record where
the regular programs were postponed
for Junior-Senior debate. All four so-

cieties were present in force, each root: |
ing and cheering for its team as it ap-|

peared upon the platform.

J. I. Knight, this year’s medal man in
his society, was chosen to represent the
Phis in the Junior-Senior debate, but
on account of his duties with the track
team he was forced to withdraw. This
left the Phi unrepresented, as the alter-
nate, Wooten, was from the Metrophi.
Although Wooten was an alternate, the
enthusiasm with which his speech was
received by the audience leaves no doubt
but that he was the best speaker of the
evening.

The affirmative advanced two main
arguments. The first, upheld by Henry
Patterson, was that in the name of lib-
erty the Philippines deserved complete
autonomy. The second, which was up-
held by Moore and Ogden, stated that
self-government would prove a success
in the Philippines.

On the other hand the negative main-
tained that self-government would not
prove successful in the Philippines, and
that they were better off under the pres-
ent system than they would be if they
had their freedom. Taylor, Burney and
Wooten each argued their point from a
different view. Their statistics from ac-
cepted authorities won for them the de-
* bate.

The debate was characterized by the
deep interest and enthusiasm of the
speakers both in their main speeches
and rebuttal.

The meeting was presided over by J.
F. Clark, from the Phi. Henry Morris,
a Eu man, kept time. The judges were
Doctors Sentelle, A. Currie, and Erwin.

an added attraction for the big athletic
day this year a number of Charlotte,
Davidson, and Statesville business con-
cerns have. offered prizes for the win-
ners of first and second places in all the

Vachel Lindsay Presents
Many of His Poetic Works

Famous American Poet Reads a
Variety of His Best Works to
Davidson Audience.

Vachel Lindsay, one of the foremost
of American poets, rendered interest-
ing interpretative readings from his wide
range of poetical works, in Shearer Hall,
Wednesday night, April 26th. His pre-
sentation was vigorous, and his poetry
exactly suited for the semi-dramatic in-
terpretation that he gave. Mr. Lindsay
should be spoken, and
| with his previous training as a Y. M. C.
A. lecture in New York, he left the im-
pression that he is an orator as well as
a poet. As an entertainer, lecturer, and
poet, Vachel Lindsay will always be he-
membered by Davidson men, ,

Mr. Lindsay opened his readings with

‘South Carolina Encounter

Fatal to Wildcat Hurlers

Wofford Game.

| With Tarzan Sorrells shoving his fast
one down the old alley in big-time fash-
jion and the rest of his mates pounding
| the apple to all corners of the lot, the

Wildcats won their third straight game,
defeating Wofford 4-1. Sorrells, who
turns them from the wrong
gave the Methodists one of the
most unpleasant afternoons they have
;ever spent. He caused six of them to do
a Casey and allowed but three safties,
| While he collected a brace of bingles him-
self,

Pat Crawford established a season’s
record when he handled 17 chances with-
Gut getting the razz. Luke Erwin also
j play ed a terrifying game at the mid-way
| station with perfect ease. McLeod,
| Brice, McMillian, and Sorrells, each of
| whom came through with two safeties,
| carried off the hitting honors of the day.
| The Wildcats picked up a two run lead
carlyin-the game. Brice scored in the
second on his single, Freeman’s sacrifice
aa MeMillian’s double, and Crawford
brought across what proved to be the
| winning run in the following canto. He
|splashed a one-timer to right, stole
second and counted on Brice’s poke to
left. The final Davidson runs came over
jin the closing frame, McMillan opened
with a single, Erwin helped him along
with a sacrifice, and Sorrells brought
him in with a smash to center, the blond
| port-sider taking second on the throw in.
Brown scored him when he nicked a
single to center,

Wofford’s lone tally came in the fifth
on a two-ply knock by Batson, a sac-
rifice hit and M. Erwin’s error. The
game was fast, being played in one hour
and forty minutes.
