From growth to maturity:

McGall Lecturer

changing paradigm

By ANN CuLP*
News Editor

Bill McKibben, an author and
environmentalist, gave a lecture
entitled “Between Hope and Fear:
An Environmental History of the
Next 50 Years” in the 900 Room on
Thursday night. He was chosen by
the Public Lectures Committee as
the McGall Lecturer when students
voiced a desire for a more environ-
mental speaker.

The Recycling, Environmen-
tal Action, Earth Day, and Biology
Comittees and Davidson Outdoors
helped to co-sponsor this speaker.
The strong support makes the idea
of an Environmental Affairs con-
centration that much more appeal-
ing.

As quantitative evidence is
formed, emphasis has been placed
on environmental problems. More
severe storms and higher tempera-
tures demonstrate that humans are
heating up the planet. In addition,

“the world grain supply has not ex-
panded in the past ten years.

“That makes changing as much

as we need to change very difficult.
Don’t make the assumption that the
appearance of environmental prob-
lems will make us go to work,
though,” says McKibben.

There are two types of envi-
ronmental problems according to
McKibben: those which have been
created by technology and can be
solved and those which occur be-
cause naturally occurring processes
happen at too high a level. One
example of the solvable problem
would be the use of catalytic con-
verters to keep carbon monoxide
created by cars out of the atmo-
sphere. However, those same cars
produce carbon dioxide which oc-
curs naturally and is also the chief
heat trapping gas now in the planet.
The average car releases its own
weight in carbon annually.

“Technology has to fight con-
tinually the mathematical momen-
tum created by growth. We’ve
pretty much locked ourselves into
that growth paradigm; most of us
live in a group of pretty relentless
consumerism,” says McKibben.

The only effective response to

the environmental
crisis would be a
dramatic shift in the
world’s lifestyle, a
world where one in
five people watch
“Baywatch” regu-
larly.

“As we are

R f Anna Judy
dragged into this McKibben said the world must mature, not

environmental era, grow in facing its environmental problems.

we find ourselves
facing intellectual problems,” says
McKibben. If the growth model
creates more problems than ben-
efits than we need a new model.
Changing paradigms calls on every
scale and every discipline repre-
sented in this room tonight.”

McKibben introduced the need
for the world to mature, not grow.
He says, “We are approaching real
physical boundaries. Every place
around us you can see our presence.
Now we need to move toward ma-
turity, a society that does not value
exuberant growth. We need to be-
gin developing in a spiritual, ethi-
cal, cultural sense.”

McKibben is the author of

numerous books including The End
of Nature, which has been trans-
lated into 16 languages.

The theme for the 1996-97
Public Lectures Committee speak-
ers was “Stewardship of the World,
Response to a World in Crisis, and
Service to Critical Needs of the
World’s People.” McKibben was
the third in a series of four endowed
lectures: Morris Dees, Director of
the Southern Poverty Law Center,
will be speaking on April 9 on
“Teaching Tolerance” in Love Au-
ditorium as the Wearn Lecturer.

President Kuykendall will be
speaking onthe Committee’s theme
on May 6.

Students advising careers

By ALLISON DoLPH
Staff Writer

Since last fall, Davidson stu-
dents have been able to find out
about summer jobs, internship, and
career opportunities by talking to
other students. Three career advi-
sors, or “CAs,” act as front line
people in the Career Services Of-
fice to talk to students and direct
them to available resources. Brent
Gilbert 99, Alan Thomson ’97, and
Lori Bramblett ’97 currently act as
CAs. Bill Felty, Associate Director
of Career Services, calls the CAs “a

great help.” Career advisors are an
asset to make referrals and interact
with walk-ins. The idea behind the
program is that it might be easier to
talk to one’s peers initially. The
CAs can also set up appointments
for students to meet with staff in the
Career Services.

Three new people will be
needed to replace the current CAs
in the fall. Prospective career advi-
sors may have an interest in
mentoring, counseling, or human
services work. Students should stop
by Career Services to pick up an
application, due March 28.

Lewis
publishes
research

By Jerrrey CoKER
Staff Writer

A promising study by Dr.
Carole Lewis will appear in an
upcoming issue of the journal
Brain Research. Her study may
help researchers to find an estro-
gen treatment that does not in-
crease a woman’s risk of uterine
and cervical cancer.

Estrogen prevents sexual dis-
comfort during menopause, de-
creases the risk of osteoporosis
and heart attacks, and protects
neurons in the brain. More and
more women are looking to estro-

the body after menopause.

may have beneficial effects on the
brain of female rats. It increased
the density of synaptic connec-
tions in the hippocampus which is
needed for cognition and memory.
This effect has been especially
beneficial in treating women with
Alzheimer’s disease. The 17-al-
pha proved as effective in treating
rats as 17-beta estradiol, the form
‘lof estrogen currently used, with-
out the increased cancer risk.
“Estrogen’s effects on the
body and brain are far reaching
and this is very obvious when the
body is deprived of it after meno-
pause. I hope to help us gain a
better understanding of the mecha-
nisms underlying its action,”
Lewis says.
The experiment was com-
pleted in collaboration with Dr.
Scott Washburn and Dr. Carole
Shydley at Bowman-Grey Medi-
cal School at Wake Forest Uni-
versity and with nearly a year’s
worth of assistance from Kristy
Ford, a Davidson College senior.
“She has been a wonderful help
and contributed a lot to the re-
search,” says Lewis. Brian Halton
he assisted last semester.
