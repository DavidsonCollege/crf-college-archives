The men who were nominated,
along with Scott, for the Davidson-

Mr. Burgess, more or less arguing
the question from the theme of
“practically vs. principle.”

The discussion was then opened

to the floor, and further arguments
were given by Mr. Burgess, sup-
porting his ideas of “psychic” and
“monetary” security.

A large crowd attended this last

open forum of the year, and Phi

heard stories in the ghost cata-
gorie from Bill Hamilton, who re-
lated a tale concerning a mad
Russian, Tom Abel, who gave some
of the story concerning the dis-
appearance of Amelia Earhart, and
Jack Stevenson, who told of the
more interesting pranks of medical
students. Mr. Hamilton added a
bit of humor by telling “The Se-
cret Lives of Walter Mitty.”

Finally the same thirty-five who
were present toasted marshmellows
around the fire. The party broke
up around ten-thirty.

FRIDAY, MAY 5, 1950

Students Use
Coffins As Homes

Two members of the freshman
class, George Nickels, and Wes
Pritchard live in what are perhaps
the most unusual of off-campus
lodgings occupied by Davidson stu-
dents. For some three months these
two have been boarding at the Ca-
they-Hoyle Funeral Home on the
Charlotte Highway, Upon interro-
gation they report that conditions
are much the same as those existing
in any private home with the excep.
tion of their closets which are cast-
uff coffin cases. There is also some-
what of a Poe-like atmosphere cre-
ated by the presence of a hearse
and two ambulances.

To earn their board they ride as
assistants on emergency calls, do-
ing minor first-aid work. Another
job consists of keeping the hearse
in readiness for funeral processions.
Wes says he lets George take care
of the latter since he doesn’t have
a great affinity for funerals and
what usually go with them.

As a whole the boys find it a
quiet life — “no one barges in to
interrupt our study” as Wes puts
it. In fact their only kick is with
the railroad schedule which sends
a train almost through the back-
yard at two-thirty each morning.
