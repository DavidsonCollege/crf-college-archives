This week, for the first time since
we installed the new computers at Da-

vidson, a student has reported the un--
authorized intrusion of another student —

into a user-file directory’ on the Prime
750. This intrusion involved unautho-
rized use of a password to gain access to
another student’s directory, review of a
file in that directory, and transfer of that

file to. another directory. I have dis-
_ cussed these acts with the student who
. violated the security of the directory and

with the Dean of Students. To remove
any doubt about the character of these or
similar acts, I list below the position of
the Computer Services Center on the se-
curity of User File Directories:

1. User File Directories. (accounts
assigned to users) are the property of the
people who own the directory; the: se-

| curity of information in these directories

is importaant to.the owners of.the direc-

‘| tories and to the staff of the CSC.

' 2. The owners of User File Direc-

tories (UFD) will work only in their own

| directories. and will not violate the se-
curity of directories that belong to other

people.

3. People who :use the computer
will not read the contents of directories
other than theirown, nor ‘will they. trans-
fer information from another person’s

An Ukauspicious Trip, But a Prendly

Davidson College: has a well-de-
‘served reputation not only for its educa-
- tional: system but also for its friendly at-

mosphere which can be felt by every

newcomer. Since I am the newest comer —

who came from the People’s Republic
of China on November 21, 1981, expe-
riencing’ an inauspicious ’ flight’ to the
United States, but receiving a friendly
treatment at Davidson, my experience is

"the freshest and most profound.

- The. airplane which I was boarding

10:25 on November 21. On my first trip
to the United States and in fact my first
which took .me

sick and jet-lagged. What is more, I was
astonished to find one piece of luggage

broken and the other missing at the San
.Francisco Airport.' No words could. de-
. Scribe how worried I was at that time. In

this. totally strange country I had no

friends: or relatives to whom I ‘could |

turn, With my.suitcase and air-ticket in
hand I was.like.an orphan, fearing what
disaster would. befall me on my way to
Charlotte and Davidson.

At 11 p.m. our airplane landed at

- Charlotte Airport where I did not expect
to be received by anyone from David-

son, for I thought that my cable of in-

fice or might be missing on the way just .
. like my luggage. Besides, it was already
late at night upon my arrival. But it was

beyond my expectation that Mr. Bold-
ing, who was supposed to be my host in
Davidson, met me at the airport, help-

ing me with my broken luggage and

helping me write a missing luggage re- |

port. Afterwards, he took me home,
which is not in Peking, but in Davidson.

some “Chinese food” without which I

would have starved to death.-Thanks to

the care given by Mr. aid Mrs. Bolding,
I'soon recovered.
Learning of my arrival,.Tony Dick,

_my roommate who remained single last

term, came enquifing whether I was
fully recovered.and what I needed. Act-
ing as a tour guide, he showed me
around the campus.

At that time I could not get my
Webster’s Dictionary which was.in my
missing luggage and wanted to borrow
one from the library. Unfortunately,
there was one copy belonging to the ref-
erence desk which could not be taken
out. After I talked my problem over
with James Moore, a sophomore. stu-
dent working on the library at the mo-
ment, he immediately offered his own
Webster’ s Dictionary to me as a gift.

’.Mr. and Mrs. Bolding’s hospitality,
Tony Dick’s concern and James
Moore’s generosity filled me with
warmth ‘and at the same time made me
wonder why they should have done all
this to a stranger like me. Is it because of
their curiosity?. Not at all. It is because
of nothing but friendliness which is the
characteristic. of every Davidsonian
whom I have met. This personal: expe-
rience. of mine has proved the friendly
feature of Davidson College which I
read from the college catalogue and

heard from other people and of-which I
- ‘was a little’ skeptical before I came.

However, seeing is believing. In my
opinion, Davidson College ‘is like a
small world where’ everyone enjoys a
unique: atmosphere of friendly human
relationship in addition to a highly com-
petitive and academic atmosphere. It is

‘seally fortunate for me to stay and

study in such an environment will never
fail to stimulate me to work land and

: contribute to Davidson.
