Coulombe reaches milestone

By Micuaet Kruse
Sports Editor

Senior Jonathan Coulombe,
who anchors the Wildcat staff, be-

came just the third pitcher in school
history to reach the 200-strike out
mark, doing
so with a
sixth-in-
ning whiff
in the series
finale ver-
SU. Ss
Marshall.
Going
into this
weekend’s
VMI set,
Coulombe led the Davidson start-

ers in wins (3), ERA (5.43), and
complete games (7). The seven
complete games is tops in the South-
ern Conference.

He has also only walked nine
batters in 63 innings. In his career,
Coulombe has a strike out-to-walk
ratio of almost 3.0.

Home sweet home

There must be something spe-
cial about Wildcat Park.

The team boasts a respectable
home record of 14-11 this spring,
but has won just once in 12 games
off campus.

Why the disparity?

“You kind of get in a comfort
zone at home,” explained coach
Dick Cooke during yesterday’ s rain
delay. “You probably see that with
alot of clubs in college baseball, but
I don’t really have an answer.

“We definitely don’t want to
get the Colorado Rockies stigma,”
he added, referring to the Rockies’
alarming home field advantage at
Coors Field in Denver.

The Wildcats do play 30 of
their 52 regular-season games this
season at home, but a nine-game
road stint, starting Wednesday at
UNC Asheville, looms.

Pitching coming around

With strong performances by
Mike DeSimone, Mordecai Stolk,

Coulombe, and rookie tandem Eric
Bowers and Jamie McDonald in
recent weeks, the pitching staff has
finally lowered its ERA under nine.

“We’ve been pitching pretty
well and the defense has been de-
cent recently,” said Cooke. “We
can’t expect to score nine or 10 runs
every game, so we really need pitch-

two-run seventh gave Davidson a
commanding 7-1 lead going into
the eighth in Saturday’s opener.

But the Herd (4-23, 2-10) tied
the game with a six-run outburst in
the top of the eighth and added a go-
ahead tally in the ninth.

Center fielder Luke Goodwin,
the Wildcats’ leading batsman,
wasted no time bringing Davidson
back, leading off the bottom of the
inning with a homer to right.

A Marshall pitching change
brought nothing but more trouble.
Quattlebaum was hit by a.pitch,
heavy-hitting first baseman Brad
Edwards doubled, and Jeff Coker
was intentionally walked, setting
the stage for Tyler, who had entered
the game as right fielder when
Quattlebaum was summoned to
pitch in the ninth.

Quattlebaum, best known for
his lethal bat, ended up picking up
the win on the mound.

In the nightcap, aseven- inning
affair, Davidson’s offense exploded
for three runs in the first, two in the
third, and three more in the fourth,
and the Wildcats coasted to the 8-5
victory.

Rookie hurler Eric Bowers
notched his second win of the sea-
son, giving up three earned runs in
five-plus innings of work.

Stafface Jon Coulombe logged
acomplete game Sunday, giving up
just three earned runs and walking
no one.

“He did a great job,” Cooke
praised. “He’s been throwing well

and had great command today.”

The 6-foot-7 senior also had
help from his teammates. Short-
stop Ben Brown, designated hitter
Brian Penny, catcher Dom
Talvacchio, Quattlebaum, and
Coker all had a pair of basehits, and
Edwards dropped a two-run homer
just inside the left field foul pole in
the first.

But all would have been for
naught were it not for Tyler’s fourth
hit — and first long-ball — of the
spring.

“His work ethic has put him in
a position where he’s physically big
and strong enough todo some things
like that,” Cooke said on Sunday of
Tyler, who is also a backup goalie
on the soccer team. “He’s certainly
maximized his opportunities. He
played well (March 15-16) against
Furman and got it going this week-
end pretty well, too.”

Tyler — who is quickly making
game-winners his trademark —
lofted a sacrifice fly to center.

A two-run double to deep left
by Kurt Davis tied the second game
at 4-4 after four innings, but VMI
took over from there.

The Keydets tallied four runs
in the sixth and Adams controlled
the usually fearsome Davidson
lineup the rest of the way, holding
the Wildcats’ big guns - Goodwin,
Quattlebaum, and Edwards - to a
combined 1-for-12.
