Transfer students come for different reasons

By NELLE McCORKLE

Sixteen transfer students
chose Davidson for varied
reasons. ; .

Academics attracted Bill
Madden, who praised “David-
son’s committment to liberal
arts, reputation for excellence.”
Madden, of Elberton, GA,
transferred from Young Harris
College. “T already love it here. I

want my family to move on cam- .

pus,” he said.
Ken Fulp wanted a “small,
intimate school of excellent

__academics” with “proximity toa__"""~

large city offering a variety in
culture and education.” Fulp
served in the Navy and attended

Hagerstown Junior College and

Florida Junior College before
coming to Davidson; he lives in
Panama City, FL. He called it
“very easy to establish a rapport
with both students and faculty
alike.”

Although he claimed to have
transferred from the University
of Florida to take “advantage of
the great social life at David-
son,” after two weeks of classes,
Matt Merrell instead noted
Davidson’s “great studying at-
mosphere.” Merrell, of Ormond
Beach, FL, called the college
“small and hard;” with an “in-

‘credibly talented teaching staff.
, John Young, Jr. of
Greensboro admitted he chose
Davidson for “academics, but it
sure wasn’t for the male-female
ratio.” Young transferred grom
the University of North
Carolina at Greensboro, where
his father, former Davidson phi-
losophy professor John Young,

Alumni involvement aided
both Jocelyn Smith and Cinda
Isley in the decision. Smith lives
in Boston, MA, but is originally
from Charlotte and attended
Queens College. “Many of my
family members have attended
Davidson and I became inter-
ested through them,” she said.
Smith’s mother, Carol Walker
Jordan, works at Davidson as
Careers Office assistant direc-
tor.

Along with “alumni support
and influence,’’ Isley called
“teacher/student interaction,
small school atmosphere, and

strong reputation” decisive fac-
tors in her coming to Davidson.

Isley, of Raleigh, left North.

she changed her major from
zoology in a pre-veterinary pro-
gram to political science. “The
people at Davidson are very
warm and friendly and go out of
their way to make me feel at
home,” Isley said.

Geography influenced Sara
Barton, Jeff Petry, and Jimmy
Rumple. Barton, of Atlanta, left
Swarthmore College to return
“closer to home.” “Excellent
reputation and’ weather” con-
vinced Petry to transfer from

Jamestown Community College
in his hometown of Jamestown,
NY.
Rumple, a married Trout-
man resident who formerly at-
tended Mitchell Community
College said, “I chose to come to
Davidson because I needed to
commute, and I felt it was the
best school in the area. I like the
atmosphere and the friendly,
helpful people when I visited. I
was impressed with the em-
phasis on a varied liberal arts
curriculum.”

Davidson’s size appealed to
Barton and.to John Fisher of
Whiteville, NC; who attended

~ North Carolina State University

last year.. According to Barton,
“people are  extrememly
friendly. Classes are hard but in-
teresting,”

Six of the 16 transfer stu-
dents enrolled as juniors; the re-
maining 10 entered Davidson as
sophomores or freshmen lacking _
only a few credits to become

men lives in campus housing.
For the first time this year, As-
sistant Dean: of Students Har-
riette Root linked each transfer-
ring man to a specific residence
hall. “The idea is to get them
(the transfer men) -more in-
volved, especially with up-
perclassmen, since the males are
off-campus.” Resident Advisor
Todd Wallenius of Belk base-
ment said. Wallenius said trans-
fer men will attend hall meetings
and hall-sponsored social eve- -
nts.

Other transfer students are
Ted Bowling of Troy, AL from
Marion Military Institute;
Becky Castleman of Louisville,
KY from the University of Vir-
ginia; Doris Davis of Houston,
TX from Vanderbilt University;
Zoe Anne Henderson of South-
ern Pines, NC from Hollins Col-
lege; Leigh McCoy of
Greensboro, NC from _ St.
Mary’s College; and Tylér Smith
of Oklahoma City, OKfrom the
University of Oklahoma.
