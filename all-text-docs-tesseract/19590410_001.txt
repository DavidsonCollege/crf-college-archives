Small Audience Finds
Bernard Peiffer Cool

By PERRIN WRIGHT
_ Davidsonien Music Critic

The Barnard Peiffer Trio, sponsored by the Gamma Kappa chapter of Phi Mu
Alpha music fraternity, played for a revealingly small audience Tuesday night in
Chambers Auditorium. Thé trio is composed of Peiffer on piano, Gus Nemeth on
bass, and Gerry Segal on drums; they have recorded on the Decca label.

The word for Peiffer's per-
sonal style is intellectual or
conservatory jazz, although he
managed to cover a wide styl-
istic range during the perform-
ance. His opening number, |
Could Write a Book, sounded
like a polished version of An-
dre Previn, but the next, Pied
Peiffer, an original, superposed
a French impressionistic sound
onto the West Coast blues foun-
dation. Still later, in Stomping
at the Savoy, he broke into an
Erroll Garner style.

Nemeth and Segal wore fea-
fured several times. Nemeth
did his best on the blues
choruses, playing fast work
and getting a good sensual
sound. Segal kept a steady
thythm going all the time,
shifting accents and effects
often and taking a few
equally placid solos.

The most natural playing of
the evening was on the blues
numbers. These were handled
in the cool West Coast style,
plus Peiffer’s own bold chord-
ing which sent them even farth-
er out. Blues for Django had
the most distinctive flavor of
all, namely Scotch. Several stu-
dents turned themselves in dur-
ing intermission. ,

The slow ballads began to
deteriorate into nightclub
productions at times, but
parts of them managed to
come through clean, simple,
and untouched by Jose Melis.

“From Du Pont Ruins
To Davidson Glories”’

By CHARLES ROSE '

Davidsonian Feature Editor
As a little boy he used to play in the ruins of a Du-
pont ammunition depot that was close to his home. He| was still a lost week scholas- group,

based on the twelve-tone sys-
tem, but it lost the semblance
of discipline which charactcr-
izes that school; Birdland was
made into a Prelude, Fugue,
and Trio, but the fugue was as
losely done as the rest.

Most of the time, the trio
played their coolest, and those
numbers got the best reception
of all. He could have played his
entire program that way with
at least as much success.

He also persuaded the audi-
ence to indulge in one of his
five-minute improvisations,
which turned out to be flashy,
but disjointed and often
tasteless,

Peiffer ventured into a few
classical and contemporary
forms with Rondo, Black Moon,
and Lullaby of Birdlend. Rondo
was easy to listen to, but it
wasn’t a rondo; Black Moon
was an original composition

Born in Washington, D. C.,
this composer-bandleader was
nicknamed “Duke” by an early
friend who admired his regal
air. The Duke's early life was
dominated by a love of paint-
ing, fur which he won a schol-
arship to Pratt Institute in
Brooklyn where he planned a
career in art. But Duke's inter-
ests had already begun to shift

after playing in several small
bands around Washington,
Duke with a five-piece band
moved to New York in 1923
and laid the foundation for a
career in original music.

By 1931 Duke had gained
the reputation for setting the
musical fashion with such
classics as “Black and Tan

Fontasy,” “Mood Indigo,” and

“it Ain't Got That Swing.” In
1933 and 1939 Ellington made
tours in Europe during which
his music was acclaimed as
one of America’s only two
original contributions to
world culture, the other be-
ing Walt Disney’s cartoons.

Soon after composing “Soll-
tude,” “Caravan,” and “IT Let
A Song Go Out Of My Heart”
for which he won ASCAP an-
nual awards, Duke introduced a
spirited ‘Jump for Joy,” which’
ran. for twelve weeks: in Holly-
wood.

In 1943 he “invaded” Carne-
gic Hall's fonghairs with his
jazz band and has returned
every year since then. In 1955
he composed and _ featured
“Night Creature,” which earned
the highest acclaim from the
critics.

Since Ellington’s rise to
fame in the popular trend of
Dixieland and the Paul
Whiteman symphonic jazz of
the late twenties, the Duke's
originality has gained wide
acclaim. “Look Magazine”
quotes Dave Brubeck as say-
ing, “lt is the raro artist who
has the imagination to con-
tinually meet the challenge
ef change. Duke Ellington,
who predates swing, has not
only met this challenge but
projects into the future.”
“Time” says of Ellington, “He
could play a week’s worth of
dances and never repeat him-
self.”

The Duke himself gave the

‘key to his uniqueness in ex-
piaining. “When I was a kid

taking piano lessons I couldn't
play musie that other people
wrote—so I began making up
my own music.”

“You get an idea for music,”
Ellington went on to say, “and
you let it rollin the mind. You
make all the big fat plans,
then you never get .around to
the plans. When you finish a
phrase at the piano—it sug-
gests something that sounds
better than plans.” That’s the
way the Duke writes a tune.
