that there will be several ladies

The weight of the building
will be supported by an interior
column every thirty feet. Be-
cause the interior walls wont
support the building, the floor
plan can be changed to acco-
modate new acquisitions with-
out weakening the structure.

“If the present rate of ac-

snrew-——an ex

quisitions is maintained — ten
thousand books a year—the lLi-
brary will last for, 3@ to 40

years,” Davidson declared.

Plans call for 400 to 600 seats,
most of which will be carrels.
In addition to the student car-
rels, there will be several car-
rels for faculty use.

According to Park, ‘“‘the li-
brary will be the one place on
campus where the student can
be by himself in order to study.
To keep an atmosphere condu-
cive to study, there will be no
classrooms in it.”

The E. H. Little library will
have a facade ‘‘which will be
harmonious with the architec-
ture of the campus,” Davidson
said.

“I think that the college and
I will be very pleased with the
design, which will conform with
the architectural style of the
campus,” he said.

rina’s sister. supposedly a

Eight College Exchange
Rumored End Disclaimed

By THOMAS AINSWORTH
Staff Writer ;

According to a recent rumor
going around the Davidson cam-
pus, the eight college exchange
program, of which Davidson is
a member and a leading pro-
ponent, would be terminated in
the near future unless a new
agreement was worked out be-
tween the participating schools.
The official reply to this piece
of information is that it “‘just
ain’t so.”

Dr. Jay H. Ostwalt, Director
of Instructional Development
and coordinator of the program
here, said that there was ‘“‘just
no basis’ for this heresay. Go-
ing on, Ostwalt stated that the
system “‘has been operating for
one year, and as far as we know
will continue. “‘Of course” he
admonished, “if (the number

written about 1597, is one of
Shakespeare's many romantic
comedies. with numerous

switches of identify designed to
keep the audience and the
characters guessing.

It is the story of a marriage
for money that turns into a
marriage of love and the tale
of a flirt who spots her prey
and reels him in.

of exchange students) drops be-
low a significant level. we will
discontinue the program. But
as far as we know, it will pick
up.”

Some of the problems with
the Consortium were discussed
by Ostwalt. He feared that a
few of the women's colleges
would limit the number of girls
they sent out if they didn't get
an increased percentage of men
in return.

He also mentioned the fact
that most of the fees of the
other home colleges, which
their outgoing exchange stu-
dents have to pay, were rela-
tively higher than Davidson’s.
For the most part, however.
Ostwalt cited the program's
troubles as being ‘‘largely a
matter of public relations,” the
girls themselves failing to ad-
vertise the program to their
fellow classmates being a fac-
tor.

In any case, the people closest
to the exchange consortium
want to see these rumors kill-
ed, including SGA President
Danny Clodfelter and Dr. John
M. Bevan. vice-president for
academic affairs.

“ Bevan expressed his concern
over the issue saying, “I don't

know anything about it, the
president doesn’t know any-
thing about it. and unless Dr.
Ostwalt knows something we
don’t, we will continue to parti-
cipate in it.”

It seems that this latest rumor
(there have been others in the
past year) originated from a
recent Student Senate meeting
in which this very subject came
up.

Someone mentioned that they
had heard this rumor and went
on to describe its details.

Even though it looks like the
Consortium will be around for
a while, Marie Ferrara, one of
seven Mary Baldwin girls in
the program, would hate to see
it abandoned.

“I really think it’s worth-
while for girls who are going
to Davidson,’ she says, ‘“‘but
maybe not for the boys coming
to us. I think what frightens

the girls, however, is that a
men’s college will be a _ lot
harder and they'll have to

spend most of their time study-
ing.”

Marie also points out that she
heard a similar rumor last year
that the program would be dis-
continued due to a lack of peo-
ple interested in it.
