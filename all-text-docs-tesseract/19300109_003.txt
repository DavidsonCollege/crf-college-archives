THE DAVIDSONIAN, JANUARY 9, 1930

Side Line Shots

At How the Wildcat Cagemen Look

By P. R. Alderman

Along with another New Year’s day
the 1929 grid season becomes a thing of
the past. The Pitt Panthers also van-
ished.

King Basketball reigns in the world of
Sports now after being reluctantly grant-
ed the throne by the gridiron.

It’s good to see Coach “Monk” take
charge of the cagemen since the holidays.
He’s got some good material to work on.

The Catawba game proved that the
Wildcats ‘have at least a potentially pow-
erful quintet this year.

Ex-Captain Carl Pritchett looks like he’s
going to be a strong contender for the title
of high-scorer again this year. He can
still drop ’em in from most anywhere.

The ’Cats aren’t a finished product as a
team yet. They didn’t show mid-season
form against the Indians but should be-
fore long.

Monk’s choice so far for his first-string-
ers is Captain Johnston, Pritchett, Rusk,
Goodson and Proctor. Four of these are
regulars from last year with Proctor tak-
ing Calhoun’s place.

Moore, Gilbert, Mathis, Martin and Mil-
ton have been acting as the first-string
reserves. With the exception of Moore,
they are all Sophomores.

With “Sleepy” Goodson and Jim Proc-
tor holding down the guard positions it’s
going to be tough-going to pile up a large
score against the ’Cats.

The Red and Black cagers have a tough
schedule ahead of them but the odds
aren’t against them like they were toward
the football men last fall.

Barring unforeseen set-becks the Wild-
cats have a mighty good chance to cop
the state cage championship. Monk has
plenty of reserves and that counts.

“Red” Laird has had his hands full with
both Varsity and Fresh practices in
charge but will now work with only the
first-year men.

There is about as much lack of really
green material among the Fresh as with
the Varsity. Several candidates for the
Kitten squad are former prep school stars.

Johnston and Rusk have both been
handling the forward position lately in
practice. With Pritchett certain for one
of the forwards, one of these two will
hold down the center’s job.

“Tex” Tilson isn’t having much trouble
finding candidates for wrestling this year.
It won’t be long before the matmen will
be seen in action.

Everybody hates to see the football
season end but there is still. plenty in
store for us here at Davidson. Monk and
Tex have some more fighting Wildcats.
Let’s back them like we did the gridders!

Current Basket Season

~~ Trips to be Made Into South
Carolina and Virginia

SIX BIG FIVE GAMES

Davidson Team Will Play Over
One-Half of Games
on Opponents’ Courts

The Davidson Wildcat
schedule, recently completed and = an-
nouced by Allan Wilson, Varsity Man-
ager, is one of the hardest that a Wildcat
quintet has attempted in several years. It
calls for sixteen games, nine of which will
be played away from home. Seven of the
tilts will be played at the Alumni Gymna-
sium, one on a neutral court, and eight
on the opponents’ floors.

Three trips will be made by the team this
year. At present they are in South Caro-
lina, where they played the Wofford, Ter-
riers last night, meeting the Furman quint
this evening. After exams, Coach Younger
will take his boys to the Old Dominion
for three games. After a two weeks’ stay
at home, in which four teams will be met,
the Wildcats again take the road for a
state jaunt, in which three Big Five op-
ponents will be encountered. The game
with Carolina on February 24th will close
the season for Davidson.

Six games will be played with Big Five
opponents, giving the Wildcats a good op-
portunity to make a strong bid for State
honors. Wake Forest and N. C. State will
be encountered once cach, while Duke
and Carolina are played twice. V. M. I.
and V. M.I., Southern conference mem-
bers, are also on the list. Counting the
games with the members of the S. I. C, in
the State, this will give Davidson seven
meetings with members of that body.

played, and the fourth will be played to-
night.
