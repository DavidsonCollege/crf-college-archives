Davidson College recently up-
graded its emergency notification
system, which currently consists
of public address speakers outside
and an electronic warming system
that sends text messages, emails
and voice recordings to students,
faculty and staff.

Known as the Students, Staff
and Faculty Emergency Response
(SSAFER) system, the notifica-
tion process is activated during
“any situation where we feel like
there could be serious injury and
or death because of a man-made or
natural incident,” said Chief Foun-

tain Walker, Director of Public
Safety and Police. “Each situation
can grow, and we have to get the
information out as quickly and con-
cisely as we possibly can. We just
don’t want to put erroneous infor-
mation out there.”

The Dean of Students Office,
the President’s Office, Information
Technology Services (ITS), the Da-
vidson Town Police, the Davidson
Fire Department and the Campus
Police each played a role in mak-
ing decisions about the upgrade. “I
don’t operate by myself,” Walker
noted. “We’ve all been having
these discussions about how this
system can work.”

SSAFER system implemented

Reverse Notification 911 system
since 2005, but as an institution “it
was time to upgrade because we
need to be able to communicate
better,” Walker said. “There are
also very specific guidelines for
higher education. For example, in
2010 the federal government will
make us responsible for timely no-
tification, so realistically we need
to have a system where we can no-
tify you within a very short period
of time.”

In addition to the SSAFER text
messaging capabilities, the public
address system is also new. “We’ve
always had a notification system;
the college had an in-house sys-
tem when there were phones in the
room we could call and
do a general voice mail
that would cause every
phone to ring, but we
did not purchase the
public address system
until last year,” Walker
said. “All we’re doing
is upgrading — every
year we're upgrading.

“The public address
system is for people
who are outside,” he
continued. “It’s a way
to get people’s atten-
tion. It has tones and
computerized voices,
and it’s also tied into
the SSAFER system.
It’s actually what I call

EAC encourages conservation

Haypen HiGcGiIns

Every year, environmental-
ly-minded students at Davidson
College organize a contest affec-
tionately known as “Do It In The
Dark.” During the month-long
competition, members of the En-
vironmental Action Coalition track
the electricity usage of the residen-
tial dormitories on campus. Results
are compared with a baseline and
reported to the student body.

What makes Do It In The Dark
an interesting case study that can
be related to the world at large, is
that artificial incentives are intro-
duced into the competition to spur
involvement that benefits the com-
monwealth.

EAC promises prizes—me-
tallic water bottles this year—to
whichever dormitory triumphs and
tries to raise dorm pride in order to
stimulate students to conserve en-
ergy in ways they might not usually
consider feasible.

In this way, Do It In The Dark
mirrors the use of real-world policy
instruments, such as carbon cap-

and-trade markets, tax deductions
for environmentally-friendly op-
erations, and carbon taxes, which
implement a carrots-and-sticks to
spur public safety against environ-
mental dangers like pollution and
global warming.

Do It In The Dark brings to-
gether two different groups (the
organizers and the competitors)
who have very different goals—the
organizers must harness the utility-
maximizing behavior of the partici-
pants to the organizers’ own ends.

While in a perfect world both
parties act altruistically in a con-
certed effort to save energy and do
good, it is difficult for the average
student to weigh the costs of a well-
heated room against the immediate
comfort it provides.

“Fifty-four percent of David-
son’s greenhouse gas emissions
come from electricity,” Sustainabil-
ity Fellow Kealy Devoy said, much
of which is generated at coal-fired
power plants. To make the benefits
of energy conservation more tan-
gible, EAC artificially substitutes
in a new reward: the prizes that go
to the winner of the competition.

EAC accepts that not everyone is
enough of an idealist to want to “go
green;’ what they do recognize, and
emphasize, is that everyone likes
ice cream.

The equation of saving energy
with getting prizes is misleading
but not altogether false: in the real
world, instead of prizes like the
water bottle and ice cream party,
saving energy results in perhaps
even greater prizes like clean air
and water and long-term economic
well-being.

Do It In The Dark’s larger sig-
nificance does not come from the
drop in school energy bills which
inevitably accompanies the compe-
tition, but rather from the messages
and lessons it imbues in students.

Saving energy can have tangible
rewards. This statement is, in fact,
becoming more relevant every day
as conventional energy resources
(oil, gas, coal) dwindle and more
and more governments offer great-
er tax- and market-based incentives
for participation in energy-saving
practices.

TB case
‘confirmed

CAROLINE Woop
News Editor

After months of fixation on
the spread of swine and seasonal
flu on campus, a new concern
has emerged: the presence of ac-
tive tuberculosis in the Davidson
community.

Yesterday, the College report-
ed that one community member
has been diagnosed positively
with tuberculosis, a disease that
rarely surfaces, even on college
campuses. “In my 15 years at
Davidson, this is the first time we
have had a case on our campus,”
Dean of Students Tom Shand-
ley reported in a campus-wide
email.

The individual has remained
anonymous, but College officials
report that they are undergoing
care at a local hospital and that
full recovery is expected.

Tuberculosis is caused by air-
borne bacteria and is contracted
by breathing infected air. Symp-
toms include extensive coughing,
fever, weight loss and fatigue.

“Although tuberculosis can
be serious, this is not a time for
alarm,” Shandley said. “Not ev-
eryone who is exposed to tuber-
culosis becomes infected, and
not everyone who is infected
becomes sick. The health of our
community is of primary impor-
tance to us, and we are commit-
ted to ensuring a safe and healthy
semester for all of our students,
faculty and staff.”

"The Davidson Health Cen-
ter, under the direction of Craig
White, M.D., promptly assem-
bled a page of frequently asked
questions about tuberculosis.
.The document covers general
information about the disease,
symptoms and protocol for test-

.ing students on campus.

Medical professionals test for
the presence of tuberculosis using
askin test, often called a PPD test

_(this refers to the tuberculin puri-

"fied protein derivative, the part of
the bacterium to which the skin
reacts). A positive reaction to the
test, characterized by localized
swelling at the site of injection,
indicates an immune response to
tuberculosis bacteria.

"This response can be caused
by active tuberculosis as well as
previous exposure or a previous
tuberculosis vaccine (which is
not administered in the United
States). A subsequent chest x-ray
reveals whether an individual
who has tested positive is infect-
