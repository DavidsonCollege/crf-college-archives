the YMCA’s three program series on the racial crisis.

“Those on campus and else-

marches, petitions, letters, and
so forth, will be in for a sur-
prise. Y president, Joe Howell
calls Kilpatrick ‘‘one of the

Library Seeks Increase

Of $44,000 In Budget

BY BUCK LAWRIMORE

The Davidson College Library
has requested a budget increase
of $44,000 for operation and ‘ex-
pansion during 1964-65. If the
request is approved, the present
budget of $93,000 would be up-
ped to $137,000.

“IT have every hope that with
the backing of the budget by the
administration the trustees will
approve the total request in
May.” President D. Grier Mar-
tin has predicted.

The increase breaks down in-
to two parts, Only $2,000 has
been asked over the regular
budget of last year to cover
rising operating costs. The re-
maining $12.000 is the total
estimate required to satisfy the
faculty’ members’ desires for
books in their particular fields.

“This estimate was compiled
in cooperation with the Self-
Study Program now under-
way,"’ explained the library's
director, Chalmers Davidson.
“We requested faculty mem
bers to make a survey of books
and periodicals in their fields
on hand in the library now, then
to request whatever they
thought would be necessary io
make our supply adequate.

“I think that the $42,000. as

Davidson requested the ad-
large as it is, will still not be
quite enough to make us ade-
quate. I regret that apparently
faculty members  misunder-
stood our requests for their sur-
veys and did not ask for all they
could really use,”” he added.

Davidson said that he and the
out
three requests for lists of de-
sired books, but that some of
the faculty still did not respond
as he had desired,

IAN that they would.

In case individual faculty
members want more books af-
ter the budget has been approv-
ed by the trustees, Davidson
said that an Excess Fund of
some $6,000 has been set aside

for that and‘similar needs.

“We never ask for library
staff raises in our budget, eith-
er,” he noted, ‘but for the past
six or seven years we have got-
en one, so perhaps the budget
will be even higher when ap-
proved."

He said that the budget does
not include expenses for jani-
tors and basic maintenance like
water and electricity, but that
the college itself handles those
costs.

“It's interesting that the li-
brary has requested an extra
amount so close to $40,000,"
President Martin observed.

“The Duke Endowment has
granted us $20,000 for expansion
of the library next year, on the

with the same amount. So the
library's requests fit in well
with our agreement with Duke,

reconfirmed when James Silver
rides in with the banner for
integration. Silver is well-known
as the professor of history at
the University of Mississippi
who has received much perse-
cution as a result of his numer-
ous stands for integration.

After being in Oxford for
thirty years, however, he has
chosen to remain, and comes
with an engrossing tale of what
is going on down in his region
of the Deep South.

Silver, who has worked close-
fy with James Meridith—the
Negro at Ole Miss and a history
major—labeled Mississippi a
“closed society’’ in a lecture
as president of the Southern
Historical Association.

Silver will arrive on campus
Thursday night, May 7, and
speak in the Morrison Room on
“William Faulkner as I Knew
Him."” And know him Silver
did. According to Dean Frontis
Johnston: ‘Silver knew Faulk-
ner over twenty years and was
one of his few very close
friends.”

Thursday chapel will be
switched to Friday to accom-
odate Silver's late arrival.

The appearance of the third
and last man in the racial crisis
series, Herbert Hill, on Monday,
May 11, will greatly strengthen
that first mentioned student at-
titude toward the Y. Hill. the
NAACP labor secretary, is one
of the foremost leaders in the
Negro revolution, _

To those who criticize the Y
for stacking the ‘‘for-against’’
deck at two to one, it might be
said that Alabama’s Governor
Wallace was originally intended
to even the slate. The Union
Roundtable Committee had
managed to secure in January
his promise to pay us a visit.

However, Governor Wallace
seems to find the intoxicating
campaign trails considerably
more inviting than the dry
campus at Davidson.

Gubernatorial Candidate Bozo
Wants To Put Taxes On Dogs

BY BOB STRAUSER

It started months ago as the
passing fancy of some nameless
gnome in the Welford suite. The
signs posted around campus an-
nounced, “Seabiscuit likes. Bo-
zo,’ “Liz drops Burton for Bo-
zo,"’ and there were other dubi-
ous gems of the undergraduate
imagination. Monday morning
chapel brought the object of all
this attention before the student
body.

Bruce ‘‘Bozo’’ Burleson, it
has been said in some circles,
is a candidate for governor of
North Carolina. By profession
he is a part-time professional
wrestler from Asheville, a man
for whom publicity is neither
an unknown nor an unwelcome
circumstance.

When Bozo speaks, Davidson
listens.

Juilliard Foursome
Closes 1964-65
Artists’ Concerts

The Julliard String Quartet
will perform with its Stradivari
instruments in the last program
of the 1963-1964 Davidson Col-
lege Artists Series Tuesday
night at 8:15.

In their countless concerts
since the inception of the Juil-
liard String Quartet in 1946,
these four artists have travelled
throughout the United States
and Canada, in Europe on both
sides of the Iron Curtain, and jn
the Middle and Far East, as
well'as Russia.

First violinist Robert Mann
was born in Portland, Oregon
where he also received his ini-
tial musical training. Mann is a
Juilliard alumnus, having stud-
ied violin there under Edouard
Dethier, in addition to perfect-
ing his considerable talents as
a composer.

Isidore Cohen, the second vio-
linist, is a native New Yorker
and also an alumnus of Juil-
liard, where he studied under
Ivan Galamian.

Violist Raphael Hillyer was
born in Ithaca, New York and
studied violin privately with
Serge Korgueff before entering
the Curtis Institute in Philadel-
phia.

The Quartet’s cellist. Claus
Adam, was born in Indonesia,
the son of an ethnologist father
and a lieder-singer mother. He
attended schools in Europe, be-
ginning his formal musical edu-
cation at the comparatively late
age of fourteen.

Monday morning, candidate
Burleson outtined his platform
with one key remark: “I want
to take the tax toad off the
people of North Carolina and
put it on horses and dogs.”
He went on to estimate that

open bars, legalized gambling,
and state-owned tracks would
bring one-and-a-half billion dol-
lars per year into the state cof-
fers. But there was more.

“Bozolands”’ would be estab-

lished for the state's elderly citi-
zens; surplus agricultural prod-
ucts (mainly eggs) would be
sold to Northern universities ex-
perimenting with such things as
a new egg roll; a ‘‘super-inte-
gration’’ program would leave
everything up to local initia-
tive. “I believe in everybody be-
ing treated fair.”

**What,"' asked a leading cam-
pus Humanist, ‘About legalized
prostitution?”’

In reply, Bozo first upheld the
institution of marriage and went
on to promise that ‘‘Streetwalk-
ers will get shots every week,
whether they need them or not.
T'll send them all to CCC camps
and learn them (At this point,
Bozo broke up in laughter) a
skilled trade. A real bunch of
queens will flock to this state
and it’s up to you young men to
take advantage of it.’ The Hu-
manist nodded, as though in ap-
proval.

Habitual interrogator Jonas
Lonnroth countered with anoth-
er question— ‘Where I come
from, we have some of the in-
novations you propose but still
50 per cent of the cost of gov-
ernment comes through taxa-
tion; how can you do better?”

Burleson began, ‘“‘Only the
federal government will get a
cut of the state proceeds: to hell
with the underworld. Where are
you from—New York?”

When Lontireth replied that
he was from Sweden, Bozo was
still undaunted. ‘‘I suggest you
bring in two or three top man-
agement men. You ought to
start moving some men out of
office . . . or uh—you know
what I mean.”

Bruce Burleson, performer,
is an interesting study. He
was graduated from Western
Carolina College in 1951 with
a major in PE and a minor in
history. (’"f put Western Car-
otlna on the map with my
wrestling and 1’ put this
state on the map with my pro-
gram.”’)

After a year in Baltimore, he
moved to California and work-
ed part time on a masters in
education at USC. He tried out
for the Pan-American Games in
1955 and for the U.S. Olympic
team in 1956. That same year,
he ‘turned professional and be-
gan his wrestling career.

At present, Burleson is an
employee of the Hicks Corpora-
tion in Asheville and is on leave
of absence without pay while
conducting his campaign, which
he has been planning since 1959.
Bozo requests that any contri-
