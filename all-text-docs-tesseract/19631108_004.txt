“Soloing will make a believer of you.” This is the way that Dick Forrester intro-

duced his reactions to the ROTC Flight Program. ;

Twelve cadets are in the’ program this vear: Haynes Kelly, Bill Beerman, Joe Mc-
Cormick, Leonard Turner, Ben McCoy, Ned Smith, Algie Guess, Atkins Embry, Hugh
Beil. Ivan Rohrer. Andy Sale, and Forrester.

It all began last spring for
the 12. when they expressed an
interest in the protgam and. be-
gan meeting its strenuous re-
quirements. Most of them re-
eeived their physical from the
flight surgeon at summer camp.

Forrester said of the
thorough physical, “If there
was anything to push, pull,
squeere, or poke, they did.”
The requirement that elimin-
ated most of the aspirants was
the one on vision—al! cadets
in the program must have 20-
20 vision.

In addition to the physical
requirements, there is an appti-
tude test that takes three hours
and a mental exam. The ap-
proval of the school officials and
the military instructors is also
required.

Fliers receive ground instruc-
tion in several fields such as

meteorology and map reading
in two three-hour sessions on
each Monday and Wednesday in
the ROTC Dept.

Cadets in the program fly
about two to three hours a week
out of the -Mooresville and
Statesville airports. Their air-
teacher is James L. Miller.. who
is a licensed Federa] Aviation
Conimission Instructor. The
plane they use is a Cessna 150
which has 100 horsepower. .

So far six of the fliers have
soloed. Kelly and Forrester
were the first to lose their
shirt tails in a ceremony each
pilot traditionally undergoes
following the first sole. They
have been followed by Turner,
McCormick, McCoy, and
Rohrer.

In return for flight training,
the cadets spend an extra year
on active duty if they are ac-

cepted into the Army Aviation
Program. The additional year is
spent in receiving training in

the flying of larger or rotary |

wing aircraft. Participants. in
the program feel that the extra

ROTC flight training has a
three-fold purpose: to motivate
students to seek a career in
Army Aviation and in the regu-
lar army. to screen applicants
for Army flight training, and to
create a pool of qualified pilots
to be used in an emergency.

Friday The Thirteenth

Friday the thirteenth marks
the highlight of the Union's
program for.November and De-
cember. This date. in Decem-
ber, is planned for the Union’s
annual Christmas party to be
conducted from 8 p.m. to 1 a.m.

As an added attraction the
party is being co-planned, co-
sponsored, co-ordinated, and co-
attended by Queens College.

The committee of girls active
in planning this event consists
of Caren Camicia, refreshments;
Eleanor Judd, transportation;
Linda McIntosh, decorations;
Betsy Heesman, candid camera;
Gracie Anderson, Queens stunt;
Barbara Mann, publicity; and
Rose "Mitchell, games.

Music will be furnished by
two combos and possibly a

jazz band. There will be »s
slow combo in the Morrison
Room, a fast combo in the
cafeteria, and, if obtainable,
the jazz group will play in the
“Cave.”

In addition to the three bands
many other events are schedul-
ed for entertainment. The win-
ning skit from the class skit
night at Queens will be present-
ed.

Another interesting activity
should be the faculty-student
stunts and games. The famous
fortune teller, Madame Zabor,
will return from her Austrian
chateau. It is hoped that free
ping-pong and billiards can be
held in the new addition of the
Union.

One of the highlights of the
evening will be the crowning
of the Union Christmas Sweet-
heart. Contestants will be
