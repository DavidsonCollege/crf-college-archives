BACK THE TEAM.

Foot ball at) Davidson during this
season of the year holds an important
place in the life of the college. A little
later other athletic interests will come in
to share this place, and practically every
man will have an opportunity to take
part in some form of athletics. Tt is un
fortunate that every man is not physi-
cally able or has not the time to take a
central place in one or more of these
-athletic activities.

However, we should not allow. the
fact that we are not ourselves on the
field to keep us from standing squarely
behind our teams, and just at this time.
this refers more especially to the foot ball
team. “These men are working hard, un-
der difficulties, to get into shape for a
heavy schedule, the first game of which
is almost here. They are asking nothin
from tis except. our fall support, and it
is our place to give it—not half-hearted
ly and luke warmly—as a critic and a
pessimist, but with a full conviction that
we know we have men representing us
who will live up to the Davidson reputa-
tion of fighting all the time—to the very
last second. givinsr all they have for the
college, and whether they win or lose.
that we can gladly sav that we are proud
of what they have done.

All of us have a feeling of pride when
our team trots out on to the field, and
even the most cold-blooded man cannot
keep the chills from chasing up and
down his spinal column when the. first
whistle blows in the beginning of a hard
game. We yell and fully enjoy ourselves
—when the ball is going our way—at
the Carolina game and at Charlotte
when Wake Forest is trving to cross our
goal, but how about all those weeks be-
fore when we should be showing some of
this selfsame spirit and thus helping the
team to get in shape for those very games
which we enjoy so much, when everv
minute of preparation counts in the final
result.

Ours can be a selfish viewpoint—of
enjoving ourselves and giving no help,
but on the other hand we can show that
“pep” now at the beginning of the sea-
son, with signs of encouragement to the
team and wholehcarted support of them.
A-good rousing “pen meeting” before
everv big game should always be a part
of the program, and he is a traitor to the
cause who does not lend his encourage-

Living

nent to this sign of appreciation arid
‘onfidence in our team.

Let us remember that when our team
walks out on to the field next Saturday
at Lexington, just as at every other game
this year, that they represent the stu-
dents of Davidson College-—~the best we
have—and it is our place and our privi-
‘ege to back the team.

THE DAVIDSONIAN PLAN,

During the short period of a year and
two months since the establishment of
THe Davinsontan we have received
the sunoort of the student body to a re-
markable degree. This apoiies not only
to the subscription list, which has been
gratifyingly large, but to the help in all
the work of the paper.

We all know that there are some de-
tails which have to be looked after regu-
larly or we will have no paper. Bur do
we all realize that we need the support
of, every student in giving news and in
time for writing assignments
which are being sent out all the time.

‘The staff is only a very small nucleus
of men who are countéd upon for cer-

tain work and who have shown that thev

can do this’ work faithfully and effici-
ently. ‘The main part of the paper
comes from the great. majority of stu-
dents who do not happen at this time
to be officially a part of the staff. We
would offer as a sutgestion that cach
man interested give his name to some
member of the staff and this name will
vo at once to the assignment — editor.
Then in addition, cach student should
keep in. mind some one connected with
the paper and:turn over to him prompt-
ly anv news that may come up. Tt mav
he alumni news, ar campus items, or
some interesting town item, ar possibly
the material for a leading article. But
whatever it may he, we want all the
news, and must depegd on the students
to give it. Tf it comes in written up in
good shape, it will be the more gladly
received.

Co-operate with us in making THE
Davinpsontan a paner which can be sur-
passed by none and at the same time.
receive a guaranteed benefit for yourself.

MAGAZINF TO APPFAR SOON.

The first issue of the College Maga-
zine will be out about the 1sth of Oc-
tober, and will be much larger than the

the manager. J. G. Patton, are now at
wark preparing the first issue, with the
helo of the staff.
