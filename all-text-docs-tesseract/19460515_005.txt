aggregations as North Carolina, Georgia Tech, ‘Tulane,
and William & Mary (the nation’s top collegiate team, in-
cidentally ) have not been met. However, no apologies are
necessary, for Coach Bill Lufler didn’t arrive here until
early in March and had but little time to whip together
either team or schedule. The bigger schools, such as Duke
and Carolina, had no open dates. Consequently, the Wild-
cats managed to walk over all opposition in what might
be termed their own class.
LUCK OF THE DIAMOND

No one who has viewed Coach Jamerson’s diamond crew
in action or followed them through the past season needs
to be told that they have been plagued by bad luck. The
breaks just haven’t been with the baseballers. It’s not a
bad nine; on the contrary it’s pretty fair and wel-rounded.
Many games could have gone our way, particularly the
last Carolina and Presbyterian contests. So, while they
don’t look too good on paper, don’t sell them short, and

LETTERS WITH MORALS

Printed below is a letter received recently from one of
the students, and participant in intramural sports. ~The
letter appears more effective unsigned, and so is published
anonymously. While | don’t agree with said letter in toto,
the moral is pointed toward the Davidson man and strikes
home. Unfortunately, there are facts behind the story.
Read and ponder. It may be worth your while.

Dear Jim:

The editor welcomes letters, perhaps you will. I] hope
you can catch my point here and put it into your column
in the nextissue.

The true test of a man’s sportsmanship, his ability to
lose smilingly and win graciously is encountered on the
playing field. But at Davidson, the testing ground is not
on Richardson Field or on the Varsity courts, but rather
on the intra-mural fields. Davidson men’s ears are al-
ways ringing with recently heard talks on sportmanship,
and when they represent the school, they think before they
speak and act. Not so on the intramural fields. ach man
is representing himself—his fraternity, yes, but mainly
himself. There are no official records that he is-aspiring to
only to win games for his fraternity and to be able to
tell the Betas or Kappa Sigmas that they won the day be-
fore, Therefore, Jim, I say that a man’s true calibre, his
ability to restrain himself comes out in the touch football,
volleyball, basketball, and softball played in our  intra-
mural set-up.

Jim, thjs “Davidson gentleman” stuff is sadly lacking.
I believe that the larger percentage of men at Davidson are
gentlemen and are capable of losing or winning as the
case may be and doing either in a fine and adimirable man-
ner. But some men, some upperclassmen, mind you, are
not so. These upperclassmen should be models for fresh-
men to follow. You notice I said should. But these upper-
clas#men run around protesting every close decision that
goes against them, play a dirt-tainted game, and seem to
spend their spare time thumbing through the rule book,
searching for loop-holes that the other-side is not aware
of. It does not stop there. Every fraternity, save for the
possible exception of one recently reorganized, spreads it
around the campus after the game is over that their loss
was only the umpire’s fault.

This is far from an ideal situation. If the athletic cup is
so valuable to a fraternity as to make it play the game

solely for the sake of winning, then I suggest we throw]

the cup away. If that is the reason for it all, let us do.a-
way with it, for it is ruining our game.

Softball is a game made to be played by men who love
to play the game. There are so many chances for a man to
play dirty, there are so many chances for a man to split
hairs, that there must be a certain code of ethics set up.
Right now some teams are playing cutthroat softball
while others play Davidson softball. Nobody likes the situa-
tion. Let us all begin playing softball for the fun in it.
Sure, play to win, but first play to play and let the score
take second place.
