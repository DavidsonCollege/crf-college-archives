faculty members and any ad-

cant is ranked on a scale of 1 to
10, with 10 being the highest
by each team member.

According to Professor of
Psychology Dr. Ostwalt, the
student whose average rank is
7 or above is a clear case to
accept, and one whose rank is
below 5 is turned down.

The borderline applicants,
with scores between 5 and 7
are put on hold for a second
rating.

Three categories of appli-
cants receive special benefits
from the admissions staff:
blacks, athletes and children
of alumni. ‘‘In the first rating
theoretically they don’t get
any special consideration,”’
said White.

“In actual practice you can-
not compartmentalize that
much. When I’m reading a
qualified black student’s folder
I figure we'll take him anyway
so Lhike his rating,” he said.

After the clear cut acceptan-
ces and rejections have been
determined, the middle rank-
ing applicants are reviewed
again. During this second
rating the special considera-
tion is taken into account.

‘‘We’ll spend two or three
long meetings going over (the
alumni’s children) in great
detail,’’ White said. ‘‘’like
we'll know Mary’s father is
deeply emotionally involved
with Davidson.”’

“TI don’t care how strong the
family’s ties are, if the student
will not be successful without
undo difficulty we won’t take
him,” he said.

White says religious minor-
ities, applicants of low econo-
mic status and children of
missionaries are looked upon
favorably by the admissions
committee, although they re-
ceive no special benefits.

‘‘We have no policy on reli-
gious minorities, but my guess
is that since they add a little
diversity they get a little edge
with certain faculty mem-
bers,” said White.

“I think I would feel some
obligation if an applicant is a
missionary’s son,”’ he said.
“The trustees would be disap-
pointed if they didn’t get
special consideration.”’

Does Davidson’s recruiting
format promote a homogen-
eous student body?

At present, students from
five Southern states— North
Carolina, South Carolina, Vir-
ginia, Florida, and Georgia—
represent 75 percent of the
total student body, according
to Leonard Satterwhite, Ad-
missions Counselor.

The remaining 25 percent of
the student population is
made up primarily of students
from four East Coast states—
New York, New Jersey, Penn-
sylvania, and Connecticut,
with some representatives of
Mid- and South-West states.
“There’s not that much inter-
est (in Davidson) beyond Tex-
as,”’ said Satterwhite.

The recruitment -schedule,
planned to a large extent
during the summer months, is
based on three factors:

One, where are the majority
of present Davidson students
from?

Two, where were the pre-
vious years’ applicants from?

Three, what areas does the
prospective list indicate as
interested in Davidson?

Priority areas are estab-
lished according to these fig-
ures. The greater the number
of students who have applied
from one area is, the more
likely the area is to be visited
by a Davidson recruiter.

The recruiting season is
from September to December.
In these four months, recrui-
ters visit as many schools as
possible, given the recruiting
budget, staff, and time.

The Admissions Office
doesn’t ‘‘plan any canned
presentation’’, according to H.
Edmunds White, Director of
Admissions and Financial
Aid. Instead, the presentation
varies with the location and
time of the high school’s
program.

North Carolina is covered
most thoroughly by Davidson
in such sessions. Individual

schools are visited by mem-
bers of the recruiting team as
well as members of the fac-
ulty, according to White.

In “roving sessions’’, each
college is given a table in the
high school’s gymnasium, and
high school students come by
the table individually to ask
questions and discuss the
college.

To those areas that cannot
be personally represented by,
but which show interest in,
Davidson, the college sends
letters of general introduction
to everyone on the prospective
list.

The college additionally
conducts motel interviews on
the East Coast to provide
interested high school stu-
dents from distant locals with
the opportunity to learn more
about the college.

And finally, Davidson stu-
dent volunteers speak in their
hometowns, both as represen-
tatives of the organized stu-
dent recruiting team and on
their own.

Prep schools currently rep-
resent ‘‘less than ten percent’’
of those schools personally
visited by Davidson recrui-
ters, according to White.

However, Duff Bruce, for-
mex, Admissions Counselor,
feels that this percentage will
increase because of the cost of
the college. ‘‘When (recruiters)
go into new areas, because of
past experience they usually

e%

go to prep schools first,” said
Bruce.

“Recruiting plays a very
important role in creating
interest in Davidson,’’ said
Satterwhite. It is important,
according to Satterwhite, in
terms of ‘‘disseminating in-
formation to students and
parents’’, talking with high
school counselors who often
don’t emphasize financial aid
possibilities, and providing
interested students with a
“contact person” in the Ad-
missions Office.

“Maybe we need to get into
more schools,’’ said White.
But, ‘‘because of the lack of
staff, you have to limit yofir-
self in order to get the most
from that staff...With two
(recruiters) on the road, it’s
tough at the office.”

“We can’t fly everywhere,”
explained Satterwhite, due to
a limited budget and increas-
ing costs. ‘If one person could
devote all of September to
December to recruiting, that
would be fantastic.” &

This year we did more
recruiting in terms of the
number of schools visited,’’
said Satterwhite, but David-
son is competing with “other
schools with larger recruiting
programs.”

Does Davidson recruiting
foster a homogeneous student
body? Said White, ‘‘the best
representation of this place is
like it is.”

SEVENTY-FIVE PERCENT of the students and parents at freshman orientation come

from five Southeastern states.

way to check that is high
school records.

“Of those who are academi-
cally qualified and motivated
those who have an interest
have a special plus, and I’ll
choose them over the others.

“Another thing I look for in
the male applicants in par-
ticular is whether they have
done any work to help them-
selves financially. That’s a
plus,” he said.

‘IT look for evidence of
academic performance in
terms of their ability, whether
they’re overachievers or un-
derachievers,’’ said Johnston.
“T look for some sign of leader-
ship qualities, working with
people.

“Tt boils down to a total
impression that is based on
bits of evidence. We're looking
for a good citizen as well as a
good scholar.

“We've turned down a num-
ber of people with high board
scores because they seemed to
be misfits.

“Any evidence of a lack of
integrity, the attempt to de-
ceive, or the holding back of
some vital information can
very well be fatal,” he said.

“The primary requirement,
where I start, is that I have to
be completely convinced the
student will succeed at David-
son and bea contributing
member of the committee,’’
said Maloney.

‘My ideal student is ranked
at the top of the class,
president of the student body,
played the piano for ten years,
and was, captain of an athletic
team.

“T like a student to show
some independence of spirit, a
student who’s different, a
student who has a unique
contribution,’’ he said.

“The first thing I look at is
the quantitative data which
indicate several things to me,”’
said Ostwalt. ‘‘one is academic
success.

“Ability is important, as a
contribution, but there are
many other fields in which
they can contribute—leader-
ship, music, drama, student
governments or athletics.

“T also try to be sensitive ta
unusual things about people
that they may contribute to
