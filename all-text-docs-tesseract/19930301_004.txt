SGA Phonathon Surpasses Original Goal of $175,000

By Mary McCrory

The smell of hot pizza wafted
down the halls of Chambers every
night around 6:00. People wan-
dered through the library with he-
lium balloons. What was this mad-
ness?

In case you missed it, the an-
nual SGA Phonathon ran from
Sunday, February 14, through
Wednesday, February 24. Every
evening “from 6-9 p-m., students
packed Chambers Gallery to so-
licit pledges from alumni.

With the organization of
Phonathon Co-Chairs Kelly
Cunningham, Bailey Foster, Tom
Koonce, DanNechemias, and Alice
Spivey, the Phonathon was a huge
success. Freshman, Independents,
Fratemities, Eating Houses, and
BSC worked together to raise
$181, 645 for the Annual Fund.

The Annual Fund provides
10% of the operating budget of the
college. Money collected from the

Phonathon will be put towards ath-
letic equipment, light bulbs, furni-
ture, WDAV, the living endow-
ment, and the Wildcat Club, among
other things.

This year, the brothers of
Sigma Alpha Epsilon pulled in
more than any other house with
$30,970 in pledges. Kappa Alpha
followed closely with $28,610, and
the Freshmen and BSC raised
$27,065,

Other houses were as follows:
Rusk - $22,300, Pi Kappa Alpha
with Warner Hall - $21,425, Phi
Gamma Delta with Phi Delta Theta
and Sigma Phi Epsilon - $14, 715,
and Connor - $12, 460.

Friendly houserivalry was not
the only reason toattend, however.
Prizes like free ice cream, free
movie passes, and a free dinner at
Woody’s were all good reasons to
attend. Also, dinner at houses on
the court were canceled so mem-
bers would eat pizza instead.

Calling for money wasn’t al-
ways easy, as some discovered.
Several students were turned down
by alumni whose children were
not accepted into Davidson. Also,
sophomore Chris Hood called one
alumna at a really bad time: her
house had just burned down! The
best way to persuade reluctant
alumnitopledge, according to Tara
Pyne, is to “Put it on a more per-
sonal level, don’t just read off the
page in front of you.”

Money from the Phonathon is
used for materials and activities
vital to Davidson students. This
should be the biggest incentive to

-go, even more than free prizes.
Also, this should be a big incentive
for alumni to give.

As Alice Spivey pointed out,
“Tt’s really a neat connection to
have between alumni and students.
You’re callilng for the school they
went to, and it’s a chance for them
to find out what’s happening here.”

members of Rusk raised $22,300.

Students and Faculty Meet to Discuss Diversity
Problem Exists on All Levels: From the Court to Classes

By Brad Johnson

Last Thursday night, a group
of faculty members and students
met for a dinner discussion on cul-
tural inclusiveness at Davidson.
Organized by Alice Spivey and
Rachel Dunifon through the SGA
and presented by Bill Mahoney of
the Religious Departmentand SGA
President Alden Smith, the discus-
sion aimed to bring a diverse group
of community members together
and to discuss the creation of a
more inclusive and integrated
Davidson.

Dr. Mahoney opened the dis-
cussion by asking why inclusive-
Ness was not more prevalent on
campus. He noted that some stu-
dents appear intolerant of people
of different genders, races, and
sexual orientations. He also stated
that he saw anxiety as the primary
cause of this problem, saying that
today’s pluralistic society creates
aneed for asense of stability and
belonging.

Criticizing Patterson Court
houses for stressing the grouprather
than individual and thus notallow-
ing for  self-identification,
Mahoney argued that many people
deny themselves the opportunity

to expand their world view.
Junior Rafael Candelario
agreed with Mahoney and added
that the court drew people looking
for an identity and thus, created a
certain amount of ‘inclusiveness

rather than the desired diversity.

From a different perspective,
SGA Vice-President Alice Spivey
argued that people too often ne-
glect the diversity present within
each house because greater em-
phasis is placed on the external
differences and appearances as a
whole.

The presentation was then
turned over to Alden Smith. He
stated that the movement toward
diversity must be led by the major-
ity. He also pointed out the expe-
rience of. Wayne Crumwell,
Davidson’s first black graduate,

who was far from happy with his

tenure at Davidson.

Problems discussed ranged
from the decreasing number of
minority students to the fact that
African-Americans often separate
themselves from the rest of the
students in the Commons during
dinner. The-committee also dis-
cussed the popular misconception

that the BSC is only for black stu-

dents.

Smithasked why the BSC was
criticized for being exclusive when
no one questioned the exclusive-
ness of the fraternities. He also
commented on the need for a new
college union that would cater to
the needs of all students and at the
same time would be attractive in
terms of social activities.

Homosexuality was also dis-
cussed. Dr. Sam Maloney shared
results of a questionnaire he had
handed out in his Christian Ethics
class. Of the students in the class,
100% agreed that they would vote
for a President without regard to
race or gender, butonly 50% agreed
that they would vote for a sexually
promiscuous or homosexual can-
didate.

It was proposed that inclu-
siveness be initiated in the class-
room. Smithcomplimented one of
his teachers for recognizing Mar-
tin Luther King at the end of class
on the civil rights leader’s birth-
day. Drs. McMillen and Curran
agreed with this sentiment and
added that students often appear
wary of discussing difficult issues
such as diversity in class.

sion was the admission process.
Some expressed concern about the
cap placed on financial aid. How-
ever, Dr. Homer Sutton, former
Dean of Admissions, stated that as
more money: was raised by. The
Campaign for Davidson, more aid
would become available.
Sophomore Anni Kirkland

__ Suggested initiating inclusiveness

during the admissions process. She
saw a questionnaire distributed to
applicants and dealing primarily
with the problem of diversity as a
way to alert potential students that
the school was serious about the
issue. She further argued that this
would allow candidates to decide
if they want to attend a college
where the issue isso prevalent. Dr.
Mahoney noted that the admis-
sions process is currently being

updated.
