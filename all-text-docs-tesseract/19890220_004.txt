Maki Mandela addresses UNCC crowd

By SUZANNE CRAYMER
In the UNCC auditorium February 8,
Maki Mandela, daugher of imprisoned
South African activist Nelson Mandela,

talked about the horrors of apartheid. Man- ~

dela drew from personal experiences as a
social worker to illustrate the black situ-
ation in South Africa.

She focused particularly on the plight of
children and their families. “The govern-
ment is trying to do away with the whole
race by intentionally killing young kids”
said Mandela. In several chilling stories,
Mandela told of 13 year-olds murdered in
front of their parents or taken away, never
to be heard of again.

The situation within the black townships
destroys family life for most black people
within South Africa said Mandela.

The blacks often work in the city, but
are required by the white government to
live in remote rural areas.

This means mothers must leave their
children at home while they live at their
employers and work as domestic servants.
Fathers are also absent much of the time
since jobs open for black men only include
migrant labor.

The government passed numerous laws
prohibiting parents from bringing their
children with them into the cities.

As a result, many are left in the home-
lands with their grandparents. Without
parental guidance, they often turn rebel-
lious or drop out of school. In her social
work, Mandela found children who died
due to lack of care or malnutrition.

“To the government, as blacks we are to

be used as objects and discarded,” Mandela
said. “They need cheap labor at the cost of
destroying our families and children.”
Repeated failure to change such racial
policies ‘as these has led blacks within
South Africa to violence. “Failure carries
new despair and that despair is reflected in
the acts of black youth today,” said Man-
dela. “The South Africa regime will not
issue reforms of its own volition.”
Mandela supported violence as a last
resort for change. She detailed the history
of revolt against apartheid and showed that
peaceful protest failed to generate reform.
Mandela said that if there had been
promising talks in 1985, then there would
be little violence today. In addition, she
mentioned the brutal government police
force which violently oppresses blacks

who try to rebel.

“The sword of South Africa is drenched
with blood, we must use organized force to
defend ourselves. No country has ever
achieved freedom without some kind of
violence” says Mandela.

Through her series of talks, she hopes
to educate people about South Africa.

Mandela compared apartheid to the hor-
rors of Nazi Germany and stressed that it
was too late for the Jews by the time the.
Allies moved against Germany.

“While the government may be succeed-
ing in deluding the world that they are
getting rid of apartheid, things are actually
getting worse.”

She hopes to remove Western blinders
and get people to respond to apartheid
before it becomes too late.

1988 Olympic team doctor speaks at SGA event

By BRUCE NEWSOME
Angus McBryde, a Davidson
graduate and member of the U.S.
Olympic medical staff in Seoul,

spoke Wednesday in Eu Hall.
McBryde discussed the impor-
tance of being involved in the
community. He said that you must
be active in the community even
if you have to start at-the bottom.
He started his community ac-
tivity in 1972 by working as a Red
Cross volunteer at Davidson bas-
ketball games at the old Charlotte
Coliseum. He would mainly look
after people who cut their finger
in the bathroom or had other
minor injuries. After 17 years,

however, he is still involved with
the Red Cross.

A danger of being involved in
the community is overextending
yourself. Hesays that he receives
requests daily for his money and
time from various organizations.
He must turn down many of these
requests since he cannot do all of
them and do any of them well.
McBryde recommends being in-
volved outside of your job but to
pick and choose where you de-
vote your time and money.

McBryde himself started at the
bottom of the Olympic medical
staff.

In 1980, he volunteered to work

at the U.S Olympic Training
Center in Colorado Springs. From
this beginning, he worked his way
up by working at Sports Festivals,
the Pan American Games, the
World Games, and finally the
1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul,
South Korea.

McBryde was given charge of
taking care of the U.S.’s Track
and Field team. This kept him
busy throughout the Games since
each Olympic-level athlete has
some sort of nagging injury. As a
result, he had to be at each of the
athlete’s events incase something
went wrong.

In general, he said that the

Koreans were great hosts and the
American press gave the South
Koreans an unfair reputation. In
fact, it was the American athletes
who were out of ‘control and
would not behave during the
opening ceremonies. McBryde
felt that this behavior was espe-
cially out of line in a country
where the citizens generally are
so well behaved.

McBryde commented on the
steroid situation, and on Ben
Johnson in particular. McBryde
says thata high percentage of high
school athletes in contact sport$
are taking steroids today.

The only way to stop this danger-

ous problem is to have spot unan-
nounced drug testing and to get
the NCAA and professional
sports united against this prob-
lem.

McBryde said that Ben Johnson
was obviously using steroids and
actually admitted it to the Cana-
dian team ‘doctor when Johnson
was informed of his positive test
for anabolic steroids.

Johnson now claims he knew
nothing about taking the steroids
and has claimed since the contro-
versy began that someone may
have sneaked something in a

’ drink he took right before the race

began.
