FRIDAY, MAY 8, 1953 THE DAVIDSONIAN

Ever since this writ-
er has been connected
with the sports life of
Davidson College's
Wildcats we have heard
{rom many sources and
. especially from the

™ past writers of this
* column of the pitiful
% Situation which pre-
vails concerning ath-
letic subsidization of
this school as compared
with that of others in
B the Southern Confer-
ence.

The cry has many
times been voiced for
Davidson to meet on the athletic field schools which are more
nearly our size and which spend more or less the same amount
on putting teams on the field. This is heard especially during
the fall and winter seasons when the larger and richer schools
leave the Cats badly outclassed.

What if some sort of rearranging or splitting up of the
present Southern Conference was to take place. Rumor has it
that that is just what is in the wind at the present meeting of
the conference officials in Greensboro which got under way
today.

PRESENT CONFERENCE HAS MANY FAULTS

In the past few years there has been growing dissatisfac-
tion all over the conference concerning the present setup and
the overcrowded conditions of the league. The league is also
too much spread out. It’s a long way from down at the Citadel
or Furman up to West Virginia or Maryland or George Wash-
ington.

The rumor which has come to our attention, which this
writer sincerely hopes is not just idle gossip, concerned a
meeting of the officials representing Maryland, Virginia, Duke,
State, Carolina, Wake Forest, South Carolina, and Clemson
which was to be held in Durham last night prior to the con-
ference meeting today.

If such a meeting did take place the only subject which
would pull such a group together would be the bolting by
these schools of the present Southern Conference and the
formation of a new conference.

LEAGUES WOULD BE EVENLY MATCHED

Such a bolt would leave West Virginia, George Washing-
ton, Richmond, William & Mary, VMI, VPI, Washington &
Lee, Davidson, Citadel, and Furman still in the Southern Con-
ference. West Virginia whose teams worked under the inde-
pendent status for many years might well return to that status

WOFFORD INVADES
AS WILDCATS CLOSE
LUCKLESS SEASON

Davidson’s_ winless baseballers
close out the 1953 season tomor-
row when they meet Wofford on
the local diamond in a contest
which affords the “last chance” for
a win. Gametime is 3:15.

It has been a rough season for
Coach Clement's crew with several
heart-breaking defeats, but fast
Tuesday the Cats lost one to South
Carolina that really hurt. After
trailing the Palmetto club for eight
innings, the Wildcats pounded out
five runs in the last of the ninth
to tie the score. The winning run
was waiting on third base, but it
never crossed the plate as a strike-
out finally halted the Davidson
rally.

NETTERS HOSTS FOR ANNUAL CONFERENCE TOURNAMENT

Hofferth Doubled

The South Carolina club came
back in the top of the tenth inning
to score one run and win the hard-
fought contest. A double by short-
stop Tom Hofferth brought in the
winning tally, as Tunstall held the
Cats scoreless in their last chance
to tie the score. John Smith, who
replaced Ish Bennett in the tenth
inning, was the losing pitcher.

Special credit is due to the David-
son infield for the sparkling per-
formance they turned in Tuesday.
In addition to executing three
double plays, they played a bril-
liant all-around ball game.

This afternoon the Davidson nine
was scheduled to play the Wolfpack
of North Carolina State here at
home. The State team, though
slightly weak in the pitching de-
partment, was favored to win.

their occupation of first place on
Monday of this week by downing
the Betas. The Phi Gams won the
only other game played by beating
the Pi Kapps. The tennis standings
are incomplete due to the great

Coach “Pete” Whittle’s tracksters will close out a success-
ful season tomorrow afternoon on the local track against N. C.
State. The meet will begin at the usual 1:30 p. m. for the field
events and 2:00 for the remainder.

The Cats will be slightly favored
and should push their won lost
record to a 6-3 count.

Last Saturday the locals routed
W&L and Furman in a triangular
meet to push their record to five
wins and three losses. Davidson
scored 80 points to W & L's 37 and
Furman’'s 35.

Koonce Top individual

Phil Koonce was top individual
scorer with 13 points. He took
tirst in the 100-yard dash and was
top man in the broad jump, in ad-
dition to a second place in ‘the 220-
yard dash.

The other firsts for Davidson
were taken by Shipley in the 440
Henry in the 880, Mitchner in the
220, Peterson in the discus, Feeney
in the two miles, and White in the
low hurdles. The relay team was
also first, but was disqualified.

A soft track due to rain the night
before held down the times in the
running events and considerably
slowed up the field events as the
footing was uncertain.

along with Miller. Garrison won
the mile and Sawyer was second
in the two-mile at the Carolina
Indoor meet in February.
Davidson's strength lies in the
sprints and distance events. Coach
Whittle will be depending heavily
on the showings of Shipley in the
440, Henry in the 880, and Koonce
in the 100.

come from behind to tie up the
contest. However, the winning run
was squeezed home in the first

extra inning by the Phi Gams.

Inclement weather caused the
post-ponement of all games on
Thursday of last week and last
Wednesday. Wet fields on Tuesday
also prevented games between the
Sig Eps and Betas and between the
ATOs and the SAEs. In spite of
slippery fields and soggy softballs,
the other four scheduled games
were completed.

Similar circumstances affected
the Inter-Fraternity tennis circuit
this week. Rain on Tuesday made
the courts too wet for play and
consequently only two games were

smaller schools after being left out by the big boys.

If such moves should occur two well matched 8 team
leagues would remain and the small schools would stop having
such lop-sided records and some really tight races for the
respective. conference flags would certainly result.

As the league now stands each team meets about half of
the other teams in the league and some never meet. That oc-
curs even in basketball where a larger schedule allows more
variety of opponents.

TEAMS HAVE NEARLY EQUAL RECORDS

Let us try to picture Davidson in a league with Richmond,
William & Mary, VMI, VPI, Washington & Lee, Citadel, and
Furman. All these teams have finished at or near the bottom
of the standings, with some few exceptions, ever since high
subsidization has come into existence.

Several of these schools have been stretching and expand-

The Cats finished with an im-

a strong start and a strong finish.
They copped their first three and

The golfers took the measure

They lost to Duke, Ohio, Florida,

The Wildcats will travel to Win-

in the three day Southern Con-
ference Tournament.
