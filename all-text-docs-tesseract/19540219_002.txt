Dean’s Appointment Approved

The permanent appointment of Dr. Pietenpol as Dean
of the Faculty has met with what might truthfully be described
as the hearty approval of the student body.

Since coming to Davidson College Dr. Pietenpol has won
the respect of all with whom he has come in contact on the
campus. In an unpretending and unassuming manner he has
established himself as one the student can trust.

At a college where much is said about cordial relations
between student and faculty, Dr. Pietenpol practices what
others preach.

The Dean himself would be among the first to object if
we seemed to eulogize him here. We wish only to give a word
of approval to a man whom we feel deserves it, and commend
the trustees and administration for a wise choice of a Dean
of the Faculty.

Editor Has Kind Word or Two
For Much Maligned Plaque

An underdog almost always manages to work up a little
sympathy from some quarters whether he has any real merit
or not.

During the last few weeks since the plaque commemorat-

ing the donors in the building drive was erected there has}

been no little criticism from some members of the college
community. We have heard little favorable comment about it,
but it is not for this reason alone, but because we feel it is
not necessarily a “bad thing” that we hasten to make a few
disjointed remarks in its favor.

Let us grant that perhaps from an artistic point of view
the plaque does not greatly enhance the appearance of the
corridor outside the auditorium. In the first place it is too
big and cumbersone, a fact which is attested to by the. wooden
stilts which support it from below. In the second place perhaps
philanthropists should forbid the public recognition of their
gifts if they are given in the most altruistic spirit.

Nevertheless men are so made that most of them appre-
ciate, if they do not require, some small recognition of good
works. There are few of us indeed that don’t let our right
band know what our left is doing. Certainly it is not incon-
ceivable that some of the plaques’ severest critics may event-
ually become benefactors of this institution, if they do, it will
be interesting to note whether they insist on complete
autonomy of the type they thought most fitting for earlier
contributors. "

As we have suggested previously there are certain aspects
of that tremendous piece of bronze that are not beyond re-
proach, or at which we cannot help but poke fun.

But it might well be borne in mind that it is the slab of
bronze itself that we think somehow a little far-fetched, not
the friendship for, and in some cases the devotion to David-
son College which it represents.

Students, Faculty Often
Stymie Class Discussions

In last week’s “Off-Moorings” Bill Moffett discussed
the problem of the seeming barrier between faculty and stu-
dents. This past week a professor here told a class that he
was hampered by the fact that students only infrequently
raised questions for discussion in class.

It is easily apparent that there may be a rather funda-
mental connection here, and that the latter instance is re-
lated to the former situation. There is lacking somehow the
feeling that professor and students are on the same team,
so to speak, and are working for common goals. Though in-
dividual relations of student and professor are often most
cordial, but as soon as the professor assumes the duties of his
station, and speaks “ex cathedra,” the barrier becomes too
often apparent. .

This is not true with all professors or with the same
professors all the time, but it is true enough in far too many
classes.

It is probably good that students frown upon the boot-
licker who seeks the professor’s approval by asking frequent
and indescriminate questions. But we wonder sometimes if
this taboo doesn’t grow so strong as to stifle valid class dis-
cussion. Fhere is little cause for jealously toward the man who
tries to exhibit his interest and knowledge. Teachers spot
these men as easily as students, and they usually get their
just desserts?

It seems to us that a genuine desire on the part of the
faculty to promote more student expression in classes, and
less reluctance on the part of students to participate, would
exert a healthy influence on student-faculty relations and also
help break the barrier.

U.S. In Danger If People Believe

Charges of Democratic “Treason’

Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wis-
consin has been vindicated on at
least one of the many assertions
which he has made in the past
few months, but contrary to what
he would have us believe, the na-
tion is at the most no better off
for it.

In_ his __nationally-broadcasted
speech “answering” former Presi-
dent Harry Truman on the White
case last November, McCarthy
made the statement that despite
President Eisenhower's publicly
expressed hopes to the contrary,
“The raw, harsh, and unpleasant
fact is that Communism is an issue
and will be an issue in 1954.” The
implication was that this was some-
thing over which neither Eisen-
hower nor McCarthy had any con-
trol, that Communism was just
destined by fate to be an issue in
1954.

Gave Fate a Scost

But it appears that McCarthy,
along with his fellow-appointed de-
fenders of “Americanism,” have
decided to give fate a healthy
boost early in this new year, with
the result that the Democrats, who
were in 1952 charged with creating
that “mess in Washington,” and
laxity in detecting Communists in
the government, are now becoming
the repeated objects of both ex-
plicit and implied treason charges.

Last week McCarthy charged
that the “Democratic Administra-
tion over the past twenty years has
deliberately and knowingly allowed

By DICK ROPER

Communists to take any position
in Government they desired.”

And from McCarthy's comrade-
in-arms, Senator William E. Jen-
ner of Indiana, came the assertion
that when the Republican party
took over last year it had found
“heaps of evidence of the stu-
pidity, the corruption, even the
treason of its predecessors.”

Extreme Extremes

Admittedly, these are only the
two extreme examples of Lincoln
Day oratory in which the charges

Ne Real issue.

The Republicans, it should be
pointed out, seem to have de-
veloped no real issue on which
they can appeal to the voters in
the coming campaign. That is one
reason, I believe, why many Re-
publicans have either actively en-
gaged in the present slanderous
campaign against the Democrats,
and why others who would not
like to stoop to quite such low
levels are at least tacitly condon-
ing these tactics. True, several

made by speakers were of greatly| party leaders have already indi-

varying degrees of seriousness.
But there are certain aspects of
the situation which make it dif-
ferent from the usual type of
political campaign.

In the first place, it is disturb-
ing to see such slanderous attacks
begin so early before a political
campaign. It is possible that when
the Lincoln Day speeches have all
been made, the charges linking
the Democratic party with treason-
ous activities and/or failure to re-
move known Communists from
Government will come less fre-
quently. But this will not happen
if Senator McCarthy can prevent
it. McCarthy, Jenner, and those
who support these two particular-
ly vocal public figures are, as was
indicated above, out to make
Communism an issue in the 1954
Congressional elections if they
possibly can, and to pin the label
of “traitor” on the Democratic
party as a whole. .

rectly censured the McCarthy-Jen-
ner tactics, but nothing positive
has so far been done to actually
discourage them.

What might oventually happen
is that the Republicans, without a
real issue, might almost be forced
by
group to use the Communism issue
as the principal one in the cam-
paign. Such a state of affairs
would be unfortunate for all par-
ties concerned — Democrats, Re-
publicans, and the nation as a
whole. For when a political party,
desperately groping for a weapon
that will keep them in power, is
forced to use charges of treason—
when such charges are clearly un-
founded—it is obvious that the
party which makes these charges
has lost its integrity; and if these
charges are accepted as true by
the people, the nation as a whole
will have lost its capacity to look

Why Does Y.M.C.A. Lack
Support of Davidson Student

As a member of the student
body, and as one who by necessity
helps finance the YMCA, I would
like to call the attention of the
student body to some attitudes
held toward the Y and offer some
suggestions as to a solution.

We all know that part of our
tuition is used to support the work
of te YMCA. Whether we wish it
or not we have a stake in the Y,
and it should concern us whether
we are “getting our money's
worth.” There are many members
of the student body who would pre-
fer not to be forced to become a
member of the YMCA. Most local
Y organizations are on a purely
voluntary basis, and I think rightly

there will be no need for compul-
sory membership. The Y cabinet
has become complacent in respect
to its service to the student body,
and one reason for this is the fact
that it does not have to perform
any real service to the student to
keep up its membership.

The YMCA des a needed
outlet for Sunday Scliool teaching,
youth work ete. but why should
the whole student body be forced
to support such an organization
when a large humber have very
little interest in this? Undoubted-
ly there are some members of the
student body who find the Y to be
of great value in their college life;
yet there are also those who see

By STEIN WILSON

no value in it at all. In my opinion
those who do not wish to join
should not be made to do so.

There are several reasons why
the YMCA is held in low esteem
by many of the student body, I am
not the first to state them, nor I
hope the last. The Y officials are
aware of many of their faults, but
they seem to be unwilling or un-
able to remendy them.

One of the prime reasons for
student contempt for the Y is
that it fails to allow enough stu-
dent participation. Each year the
Y sends to the student an invita-
tion to join in its work. Those run-
ning for president of the Y the
last three years have had this plenk
in their platform: “I will make
sure that these invitations are fol-
lowed up—everyone will get his
chance to work.” All three years
these invitations have been ignored
for the most part. Every year a
large number of students sign
these blanks, and some how the
same few members of the student
body get the jobs, The Y cabinet
is aware of this fault, as certainly
the student body is, but why does
it continue to happen? If the Y
is going to get the support of the
student body it had better allow
more willing students to partici-
pate in its program.

The failure of the Y Gift Fund
is an excellent example of the
student body’s lack of interest and
concern for the Y. Some would at-

tribute this failure to the fact that
the student body has the “wrong
set of values. It is true that the
average student spends more
money for a dance weekend than
he voluntarily gives to the Y. The
Y has a worthwhile project in
helping the Negro community of
Davidson, and I think most of the
student body realizes this. Yet in
discussing the.matter with other
students, I find that many did not
contribute to this cause simply be-
cause the YMCA was sponsoring it.
Much of the student body's dis-
content centers around the fact
that the Y is one of the many
things forced upon it. Most people
have a reaction against things
which they are forced to accept
without a choice, and I think this
has happened in the case of the
Davidson YMCA. I would like to
see the Y put on a completely vol-
untary basis, By doing so the stu-
dent would not feel the resentment
of having something forced upon
him. The Y, on the other hand,
would have to improve its pro-
gram by using the resources of a
larger number of the student body,
and thus encourage membership
and a more worthy attitude of the
student body. I believe that the
YMCA definitely deserves a place
on the Davidson campus, but I do
not think it is right to force the
student to become s member.

In the past. few years, this art
has developed to such a point that
now there is a real demand for
one writer on the editorial page
to continue in the semi-iconoclas-
tical position of tearing Davidson
apart—piece by piece, point by
point, personality by personality.

To be sure, it has always been
a journalistic prerogative to attack
and to point up shortcomings, but
today the style has gone to such
a past that unless a writer is rip-
ping limb from limb, he is con:
sidered an apologist.

Now what seems so incongruous
to this writer is that for year on
end, the same, or similar, line of
attack is trotted out, fitted up with
a few new adjectives, and made
to deal the same blows with little
or no appreciable affect on the
status quo.

Well, then, why continue beat-

eptitude in this way.

tion here that is derived
from the too homogensous
nature of the student body
end also finds itself in the
lack of traditional academic
spirit.
2. Conformity in meny forms,
one of which is the administra-
tlon’s control over our pro-
grams,

tween students and professors.
4. The air of unnecessary~
formality, arrogance and snob-

more than a few faculty members
are in favor of a change in chapel,
but as long as the trustees say,
“No”, our hands are tied.

Our hopes of rectifying these
vast failings in the Davidson sys-
tem are based on a fly-by-night lack
of realization. You see, the only
real way in which Davidson will
change will be through tlhe trus-
tees.

That august, conservative, tradi-
tion-bound, middle class, bour-
geoise minded group is so made
up that they not only will not
change their stereotyped attitude
but as well they cannot, because
of the nature of things.

In the first place, they cannot

have accurate knowledge of what

Davidson is today. They aren't here
to see it, and as the French put
it, “Pour comprendre, il faut que
vivir.” In other words, they
haven't an understanding of the
scope of present-day discontent on
the campus, and further, they will
never gain it.

Secondly, every alumnus of Da-
vidson is thoroughly convinced
that the school was at its best
when he was a student here. The
trustees are made up of alumni
primarily, as you have a continual
process of attempting to turn the
clock back, rather than looking
forward, or even surveying ac-
curately the present needs of the
student body.

Unlike some of my colleagues,
I am about ready to call it quits
on our trying to change for the
better. I would give it up entirely,
if only I, too, didn’t have .. . hope.

THE CABBAGE PLANTER:

THE WORRY CHRONIC

Beatrice’s life was almect
ruined because she was going
with the wrong type of man.
Be considerate of these mod-
ern Sir Gallahads, for there
are thousands of them. And
thenk your editor for exposing
these pitfalis of the “savorism
complex)” for they are far
more numerous than any of
you good folks even imagine.

o.h6.86h6t
Case LSM: Beatrice L. is a puz-
zled young college woman in her
early twenties, and she writes to
me to see if I can help her:

“Dear Dr. Todd: I am a puzzled
young college woman in my early
twenties, and I am writing to you
to see if you can help me. About
a month ago, a boy whom I had
been dating fairly steadily and I
decided that we didn’t have a real
community of interest, and that
it might be wiser for us to stop
dating each other. For about two
weeks afterwards, I was unhappy
at times, and not always able to
concentrate on my school work.

I am perfectly all right now,
though, am doing well in school,
am dating a number of other boys,
and am not unhappy at all.

I am puzzled, however, about the
two weeks after we broke up when
I occasionally felt unhappy, and I
wonder if there might have been
something wrong with me. Can
you help me, Dr. Todd?”

There certainly is something
wrong with you, Beatrice L., and
unless you and all the other
readers of this public-spirited
newspaper wake up to the facts,
then you're in for serious trouble
as a victim of the common “sav-
orism complex.”

Unsavory Beatrice

In the first place, I would say
offhand that you are conceited,
self-centered, egotistical and sel-
fish.

Moreover, though you were too
cowardly to come right out and
say it, I can tell from your letter
that you are used to running
around to taverns, engaging in a
multitude of unsavory affairs, re-
gardiess of whom it was you were
able to pick up in these taverns.
In general you were, and are, a
disgrace to your church and your
community,

Consequently, when this former
boy friend tried to make a decent
person out of you, you reacted
against his noble efforts. You
rushed back on the road to sin
and ruin, rationalizing it all with
a couple of glasses of demon liquor
at the bar.

By DR. MILLER T. TODD

Oeceitful Beatrice

I am sure that you,* being a
profligate tavern frequenter, smoke
cigarettes. Did you know that a
smoker burns up almost three
times the money each year on his
cigarettes as the average person
contributes to the church? If you
readers want to find out how you
can do something about this
menace, write for my booklet,
“How to Light Your Cigarettes with
Matches Instead of Money,” in care
of this public-spirited newspaper.

But this is not all there is to
Beatrice L's tragic story. As I
could early tell from her letter,
she interpreted her period of un-
happiness after breaking up with
her boy friend as a “savorism com-
plex” sign that she should go back
to the life of sin and disgrace
which she formerly led.

Bravo, Dr. Todd

Fortunately, I was aware of a
fact that Beatrice didn’t know: the
average person spends more time

which I was able to make after
reading her letter which I re
printed for you.

Not wishing to embarrass Beat-
rice, I didn’t send them a copy
of her letter; but merely told each
one that Beatrice had dated one
man for several months, but had
broken up with him because he
was virtuous. Actually, I wrote,
she is conceited, deceitful, un-
savory and a cigarette smoker only
when she is happy. Therefore, if
they were worth their salt as un-
savory boy friends, they would
think twice before they dated a
deceitful girl who might change
her ways at the slightest excuse.

In this way, I was able to help
Beatrice out of what was obviously
a horrible and ticklish situation.

If others of you young readers
are troubled with the same di
lemna, then write for a copy of
my free marriage counseling serv-
ice, “How to Pick a Mate Out of
State.” Written with the help of

being unhappy than he does play-j my first four wives, it has brought

ing the steam calliope.

So, unbeknown to Beatrice, I
went to the college town where
she is in school and where I was
able to find out secretly the names
of the men she is dating these
days.

Returning to Chicago, I mailed
a letter to each of these college
men, enclosing the full analysis

savor into thousands of unsavory
lives.

MUSIC, JAZZ, MARTERIE

By WATT McCAIN

At tonight's formal dance open-
ing the Midwinters festivities, Da-
vidson gets its first chance to hear
one of America’s foremost young
musical organizations. Ralph’ Mar-
terie’s orchestra, termed by Down-
best magazine as “the nation’s
most promising band for ‘54,”
should continue their campus pop-
ularity drive and 800 IFC mem-
bers should receive four hours of
real enjoyment.

The average Midwinters couple
will enthusiastically agree that
“he’s really good!”—that is, if Mar-
terie slurs over the better part
of the evening with cuddly bal-
lads and occasionally blasts off an
ear-splitting opiginal dominated by
the brass or a swinging bop to
pacify the South Caroling beach
beaucats. With concentration on a
drag beat adorned by swee’ melo-
dies and tender lyrics and with
insertion of several well-spaced
hand-clapping roof raisers, Ralph
an note another success in his
mute.

This is American music, an out-
growth of American jazz, but now
basically unlike jazz in having lost
that art characterized by a free-
dom to respond to a “feeling” of
rhythym, yet within the bounds
of harmony. In this sense jazz and
popular American music are
fundamentally different although
one’s genesis was in the other.

An outstanding dance musician
is more apt to be an artist of mass
psychology than one of jazz. Music
is big business. Great corporations
in the radio, movie, and rocord-
ing fields depend heavily upon it
for their existence; music affects
the welfare, too, of the dance hall
janitor and the TV cameraman. In
the music industry itself, com.
competition is keen and the herd
of dance bands are constantly
battling with one another for top
spot in the public ear. In order to
achieve success, or just survival,
the band must naturaly cater to
the demands of the public.
