Students Can Contribute, Too

“The goals of a liberal educa-
tion should include training to
develop a discriminating mind
in the fundamental ways of
thinking, to acquire ability to
handle complex ideas, to obtain
a mind capable of examining
the purpose of life. to acquire
the knowledge and skills neces-
sary to earn a living, and to
develop personality and char-
acter which will most effective-
ly serve others.”

—Dr. Pietenpol

Much has been said about David-
son College and its role as a liberal
arts college. Most of it has been in
philosophical and theoretical terms,
while little has been in concrete and
specific terms. With this background,
the Davidsonian feels that now is the
time to begin to work on a study of
the liberal arts curriculum from a
specific standpoint. Now is the time
to revise the Davidson course of
study.

The faculty at its February meet-
ing instructed the Curriculum Com-
mittee to re-study the present curri-
culum, and to present a revised pro-
gram to the faculty. No time limit was
set. This action represents the cul-
mination of the recent trend toward
revising the curriculum as already
seen in the progressive- changes in
the Mathematics and English depart-
ments.

The Davidsonian feels that the
student body has shown substantial
interest in this matter in the past, and
could contribyte valuable suggestions
toward this study.

For this reason, the Davidsonian

proposes that some interested student
organization (such as Phi Beta Kappa
or the Student Council) sponsor an
open forum to discuss révising the
present curriculum. The faculty com-
mittee could be the panel members,
and the students could ask questions
concerning the present program, as
well as make suggestions for revising
the course of study.

After the forum has been held,
a committee of students could draw
up and present to the faculty curri-
culum committee a report consist-
ing of specific suggestions for the new
curriculum. In this way, the faculty
could have the benefit of student con-
cern and suggestions for a more vi-
talized course of study.

As Dr. Cunningham said at his
news conference this week in refer-
ence to our present curriculum, “it
is so easy to Keep it that way.” And
Since it is so easy, the tendency is
to follow the path of least resistance.

If the students, therefore, are in-
terested in making a _ penetrating
study of this problem, now is the time
to initiate some action. The members
of the faculty curriculum committee
are Professors Lilly, Watts, Gallent,
Logan, McGeachy, Workman, and
Pietenpol, who is the chairman. These
are the men to whom student opinion
should be voiced.

We hope that some student
organization will accept the responsi-
bility of pushing for a more vitalized
and up-to-date curriculum at David-
son College.

Fine Arts

The Tenth Annual Fine Arts Festi-
vals, which extends from April 4 to
24, is currently, quietly in -progress.
The Festival directors have under-
taken “to contribute to a more sensi-
tive awareness and a deeper appreci-
tion of the place of art in our con-
temporary society.” It is an object
that, for the local campus, is lofty,
necessary and admirable.

At times it may seem to be a
rather thankless job when anticipated
large audiences fail to materialize and
cuts in the budget hamper prolific
‘plans, but. Professor Trakas and his
committee of four should be congrat-
ulated on their efforts to bring
glimpses of culture into a college
society that certainly lacks it.

Reductions that have diminished

funds to only one half of what they
were four years ago prevent the dis-
playing of exhibits like the million
dollar collection from the’ Metropoli-
tan Museum in 1953; but through dili-
gent planning, drawing from the
Artist Series performers and relying
on student body musical groups and
artistical talent, the committee has
formed a varied and enlightening pro-
gram.
In selecting outside performers
every effort has been made to obtain
those artists who are willing to explain
and share their work with the audi-
ence, those who will communicate
what they attempt to achieve.

The results have been excellent.
Who but Mrs. Muir herself could ex-
plain how she had imparted rhythm
and life to her paintings of South
Carolina plantation scenes? It is the
type of knowledge that cannot be
Jearned from a book nor bought for
a price “later.”

Professor Trakas speaks with opti-
mism about the festival and its fu-
ture. He cites the fact that student
and community attendance has been
slowly but constantly increasing in
recent years.

Col. Sapp Is
Valuable Citizen

As far as the Davidson community
and the college are concerned, the
transfering of Lt. Col. John D. Sapp
from _ his Davidson assignment
amounts to more than the mere shift-
ing of another Army career officer.

For the past three years Col. Sapp
has been the head of the ROTC De-
partment at Davidson. Under his lead-
ership and direction, the military de-
partment has risen to one of the most
respected departments in the college
system.

The delegation of authority to the
student cadets, and the increased
prestige of the ROTC have been the
two most noticeable achievements of
his administration. Moreover, the de-
partment has moved from its old and
inadequate facilities to its new loca-
tion in the basement of Belk.

Not only has Col. Sapp won the
respect and friendship of the college
students, but has been one of the
most civic-minded citizens in the town
of Davidson. His work in the com-
munity has included everything from
the Thanksgiving turkey shoot to the
automobile safety campaign. Proba-
bly the most notable achievement of
his continuous efforts is the new St.
Albans Episcopal Chapel that is now
nearly completed. Mrs. Sapp has also
taken a keen interest in the work of
the community and of the Episcopal
mission.

The college and the Davidson
community are losing two of their

most outstanding and interested citi-
zens. We give them our thanks and
offer them our best wishes in their
new assignment in Germany.

Voting for the editorship
of the college yearbook,
Quips ’n Cranks, will take
place at the chapel period
on Tuesday, April 23.

The two candidates,
Dave Bradford and Ed
Irwin, were nominated by
the Publications Board.

Their platforms appear
below.

DAVID BRADFORD

In writing the annual report
of Davidson College one might
ask himself (and justifiably so)
exactly what purpose does he
have in mind. Should he con-
form the facetious yet
satirical edi-
tions that scorn
every  estab-
lished practice
and institution?
" Should he go to
the opposite ex-
treme and por-
tray the college
and student as

Bradford as exhalted and
sublime association? Or should
he in an unbiased manner with
the help of a truly representa-
tive group display Davidson Col-
lege, not as the idealistic pres-
sure groups might want it, but
as it actually exists, a living en-
tity? The latter alternative is
my objective.

to

Basic Organization

But to be more specific let
me give a few precise points.

Organization is a problem that
has plagued nearly every an-
nual editor. The proposition of
how to be different yet not go
over board presents a unique

QUIPS AND CRANKS

challenge. It is my feeling,
however, that the annual should,
be highly sectionalized, the vari-
ous headings being Sports, Fra-
ternities, etc. From this basic
skeleton, the editor and staff
could branch out in a creative
and interpetive fashion.

Many of these departments

or sections need revitalizing.
The Honorary Fraternity sec-

tion has quite frequently been
thrown together in a sporadic,
haphazard manner, Originally
might well be used here. The
College Union Committee,
which has been ignored in the
past, merits recognition. As the
introduction is of considerable
significance to the outcome of
any publication, I should like it
to be unique, effective, and in-
teresting.

Senior Class Section

However presumptuous it
might at first appear to be, I
would like to see the idea of
a new séction materialize in
the 57-58 publication. The very
intrusiveness of this section
lies in the nature itself, that be-
ing a story of the Senior Class
and its four years here at Da-
vidson. This would be told in
picturesque form, highlighting
the main activities and events.
1 feel the inadequacy of such
a story would be counter-bal-
anced by the practicality of see-
ing and feeling a continuous
pattern in our college career.

In short as I look back over
the excellent publications and
especially the jobs done by the
last two editors, with whom I
have had the good fortune of
working under, I realize that

the challenge is demanding and
the responsibility is magnani-
mous. Yet I pledge myself, if
elected, td present to the best
of my ability an annual that is
in keeping with the honor and
dignity of Davidson College.

ED IRWIN

Thomajat defined an editor
as one who makes a long story
short and that is exactly what
the editor of the Quips and
Cranks must do. He must con-

dense every phase of Davidson
___life for the en-
tire academic
year into one
publication. To

alin,

© do this is a

l great responsi-.
bility to the

. dlass of 58 as

t vell as the Da-
vidson student

Irvin body.

Because of this great respon-
sibility to the senior class, I
think more decisions ought to
be brought to the class itself.
The nomination and election of
the person to whom the annual
is dedicated should be done by
the class as a whole not just
the editor. The editor also
should listen to his staff’s ideas
and make changes where ap-
propriate. In this way the Quips
and Cranks will represent the
school as a whole and not just
the ideas of the editor.

Experienced Staff

Since the annual is the one
permanent publication, it must
be made from only the highest
quality materials. To attain this
a talented and experienced
staff is needed. The staff must
be chosen in September so that
work can begin as soon as pos-
sible and dead lines can be

LETTER TO EDITOR

Vespers---Really Compulsory?

Dear Editor:

I think it Is time someone
gave an answer to Mr. McVay
and although I feel less than
qualified, I shall attempt to
state why I think compulsory
vespers is a better system than
voluntary vespers. I am not
necessarily at variance with
Mr. MecVay’s views. I just feel
that he has left out some valid
reasons which would supercede
his. I would like to confine my
remarks to the vesper_ ser-
vices, since I too feel that cha-
pel is just a student assembly.

I find it hard to call vespers
at Davidson compulsory. In
fact, juniors and seniors were
obliged to attend only seven
services out of fifteen first se-
mester by virtue of six regular
cuts plus two free cuts. The
system seems to be merely a
reminder to come to vespers

when you get a chance, but that
is nether here nor there.

Compulsory vespers is not, as
Mr. McVay intimates, an obli-
gation to believe or worship.
It is merely an invitation. Many
people, after being compelled to
do a thing which they did not
like, have found that this thing
was in reality good and that it
had been distorted in their
minds, I feel that vespers could
conceivably render such a ser-
vice in the spiritual realm.

Other reasons could be given
for the semi-compulsory ves-
pers systems on this campus,
but I shall stop here. Then, I
would like to say that I well
realize that these reasons are
traditional and conservative,
but they must not be discarded
simply on these grounds. I am
sure that they have not been
enunciated very well. I am also

aware that they are not com-
pletely valid in every case.
Neverless I feel that they are
reasons that form the basis of
a better system than that of
voluntary vespers.

In conclusion, I would submit
the negative reason for compul-
sory vespers. There are no good
reasons for abolishing them.
Mr. McVay did not give any
such reasons that I could find.
He just said that the attitude
of the students toward this was
not what it should be and that
we should not oblige anyone
to believe. Neither of which are
relavent enough to form rea-
sons for abolition. Before any-
one undertakes to do away with
such an institution as compul-
sory vespers, I feel that he
should present a better reason
than he just can’t find any rea-

son for keeping it.

met. There should be staff mem-
bers from each organization, and
these members should meet
with the editors to discuss any
new ideas and be informed of
the progress of the publication.

I call for no radical deviation
from the present layout which
has the different sections with
one section devoted to the
chronological listing of campus
activities. The fraternity sec-
tion should remain the same
size. I think that each fraterni-
ty should elect its own repre-
sentatives to do the copy and
layout for this part since each
fraternity would know who was
the most capable for the job. In
the sports section there should
be equal and adequate cover-
age, but I will try to surpass
my predecessors and have a
more complete coverage of the
sports scene.

{Editor Candidates Present Election. Platforms

Photography is always one of
the most important aspects of
any yearbook, and there is al-
ways room for improvement in
this field. The Quips and Cranks
is no exception. There should be
more pictures, and each one
well planned in advance so that
every phase is depicted in the
best manner possible.

Copy is another important
part of any publication and
should be improved on. Since
it is to be read in the future,
it should be accurate as well
as readable. The most talented
writers should be called upon
to furnish this fresh reading.

Proposing a more representa-
tive annual, sectionalized lay.
out, more complete sports cov-
erage, and better photography,
I submit my candidacy for the
editor of the Quips and Cranks.

COFFEE BREAK

Facts:

What Meaning? ' ~~” —

Beginning this week, the
Davidsonian is instituting a
new editorial column to re-
place “From the Top of the
Dome.”

John Bernhardt and Bob
Jones, both rising seniors,
will write for this new col-
umn to be called “Coffee
Break.”

The views expressed in
this column are those of the
writers, and not necessarily
of the Davidsonian.

We hope that you will
find this column interest-
ing, provocative, and time-

ly.
By BOB JONES

The popularity of TV’s lu-
crative quiz extravagancies is
incredible. Back in the old days
when Campbell’s Soup was
pushing “Double or Nothing”
the stakes often soared to $100.
Now, however, the new genera-
tion of progress looks on such
scant shekeles as just another
phase of the “unfortunate
Forties.” For with the pregnant
idea of a slick promotion man
and the financial doctoring of
a cosmetic company which
makes millions on women’s
vanity, a new era of uncreative
entertainment has been born.

CBS set the pace with the
“$64,000 Question,” soon fol-
lowed by the Not to Be Couped
network’s “Twenty-One.” Dur-
ing the brief history of these
programs and their offspring,
the star contestants have ranged
from a Pennsylvania Sunday
School teacher who packed her
purse at $32,000 (and then
picked up $2500 for reading the
Bible, with appropriate organ
background, on Ed Sullivan's
show), to Charles Van Doren,
astonishing Columbia Universi-
ty English instructor, who com-
pletely iced an already cool
$143,000.

The latest sequel to the Van-
Doren case is his support to
the government’s bond drive,
the promotion angle being “He
knows the answers about
bonds.”

Besides carrying the gross

misnomer “question” (the little
quiz amounts to a rather rugged
oral examination), there are
other “questionable” aspects to
what the programs reflect. As
Vivienne Nearing, the conquer-
or of Van Doren, suggested,
“Knowledge is for a different
end, for man to know himself
and the universe better.”

Surely the display of erudi-
tion made by the contestants
is remarkable, but in consider-
ing that twenty million uneru-
dite loafers are watching (eager-
ly held in suspense by elaborate
stage props and dramatic
sweating by the MC) one won-
ders if this is really TV's
“health restoring antidote to
Presley.”

No doubt. it’s fine to know
all the islands and countries
on the equator, the fate of
Henry VII's six wives, the
common thames for caries,
myopia and missing patellar
reflexes etc., but in the case
of the average college student
(say at Davidson) it often ap-
pears that the acquisition of
mere facts is considered to be
all that is involved in education.
This is dubious. As philosopher
Mortimer Adler, in discussion
about the quizes, put it, ‘Tm
aghast that anyone would have
this kind of information. I
wouldn’t be caught dead with
it.”

Sitting back and watching
someone else (say a contestant
or perhaps a professor) show
how much he knows is an en-
tertaining sport as atested to
by the somnambulism of twenty
million Miltown quiz fans.
When this is done in a liberal
arts college, however, it reveals
a glaring weakness: the lack of
creative intelligence.

A fact has no meaning; it is
only with an education which
assigns meanings to facts and
assimilates them into worth-
while experience that a mind of
significance is created. Joe Fri-
day's jargon about “Just the
facts ma’am” is not the motif
of intellectual investigators.

The cry for creative initiative
and independent inquiry at Da-
vidson has been made before;
perhaps someday, as Tom Mor-
gan brightly predicts, it will
not go unheeded.

Keep Sauve

Now to our dismal world comes another of those
pills which are designed to make everybody happy. The
name is promising—Suavitil, and the pill is supposed to
help with psychosomatic complaints. And, we deduce,
make people a little more suave all around.

Certainly there is a market for something like
Suavitil, what with high taxes, high budgets, tight money
and tensions in the Middle East. Thus far we have de-
pended mainly on the old fashioned aspirin.

But we wonder what the impact will be on that
great invention, the Miltini? This is a standard dry mar-
tini in which is dissolved some of that already-famous
tranquilizing drug, Miltown, for the ultimate in tranquili-

zation.

Will it be replaced by the Suavitini? If such a cock-
tail will just keep us suave, after three or four rounds,
we will hold the manufacturer to no other therapeutic

benefits.
