ACTIVITIES

DR. HOOD’S BIBLE CLASS
ORGANIZED LAST SUNDAY

At the organization of Dr. Fraser
Hood’s Bible Class last Sunday, J. C.
Wool was elected president; T. L. Fras-
er, vice-president, and H. H. Smith, sec-
retary and treasurer. Dwight Chalmers
had charge of organizing as Dr. Hood
was absent in Greensboro. Dr. Petten-
-gill taught the lesson and led the dis-
cussion,

It was -decided that the offerings of
the class would be kept separate from
the rest of the Sunday School collec-
tion and would be used for some spe-
cial purpose. It will probably be used
to support an orphan at Barium Springs,
as this, being near Davidson, will lend a
more personal touch.

The attendance will be boosted and
the record attendances of last year are
hoped to. be obtained. Every member
is on the attendance committee to en-
large the size of the class.

BIBLE CLASS ATTENDANCE
SHOWS FURTHER DECLINE

The record of the Wednesday night
Bible classes shows that attendance has
dropped from 295 on September 28th to
205 last week. Ninety were absent, and
the first number makes it plain that
hardly over half of the total number
of students were present at the first
meeting. Perhaps this decrease is due
to the fact that Thursday is a full day
for many. and some students feel that
they cannot spare even 30 minutes from
their studies. If this is true, it would be
advisable to change the time of the
meeting, which may be shifted to an-
other night with advantage to all. A list
of the various classes with the number
present at each follows:

R O T C COMPANIES PRACTICE
ARMISTICE DAY MANEUVRES

All companies in the battalion com-
posing the Reserve Officers’ Training
Corps unit of Davidson College are now
working’on the stunt drills to be given
on Armistice Day. Each company has
its own plans for the day. These plans
are not to be known by the public or
by the other companies until they are
seen enacted on the field at the given
date of November 11th. The companies
have selected their colors, but they also
have not yet been announced by the of-
ficers in charge.

MINISTERIAL BAND'S FIRST
DEPUTATION OUT LAST WEEK

The Ministerial Band, on Sunday, Oc-
tober 16th, sent out its first deputation.
Henry Patterson, R. Bitzer, and T. A.

Lacy, went to Huntersville and there)

conducted services in the Old Hopewell
Church. Both morning and evening
services were well attended, especially
by the young people.

The morning service was led by Bit-
zer in’a very unique way. He stated
the question: “Resolved, That every
young Christian not providentially hin-
dered should give full-time Christian
service,” and in true debater’s style he
proved that the ministry was the best
field for this service. Patterson closed
the morning service by showing the
great need of ministers, and what a
great life-work is open in this field.

At the evening service Bitzer, by
means of blackbarPeaharte; showed just
what our church is dot The service
was closed by Patterson making a per-
sonal appeal to all present in behalf of
the ministry.

The Ministerial Band plans three
more deputations for the near future:

one to Monroe, one to Harrisburg, and)
one to the A, R. P. Church at Hunters- |

ville. This is the first year the Minis-

terial Band has ever done any deputa-|

tion work, and the fact that their first
services were well attended is a great
encouragement to them.

tary Dwight’ Chambers was in Canton,

SENIORS PLAN FOR SENIOR
WEEK, NOV. 25TH-28TH

Ye Seniors, stop, look and listen!
There is a great day in store for you,
not far ahead. ' Beginning November

e5th.and extending through November

28th, there will be one of the greatest
eccasions ever held at Davidson College.
This occasion is going to be known as
“Senior Week.” It has never before
been even dreamed of at Davidson, but
without a doubt it will eclipse the grand
Junior speaking events of last year.
The program has been skillfully work-
ed out and promises to have a thrill in
store for almost every minute of the
time. On Friday morning the Glee Club
will make its first appearance before the
public, Under the able leadership of D.
P. McGeachy it has indications of being

the best in the history of the college. |

Friday afternoon the “Wildkittens” will
battle with the Clemson second team.
The Kittens have a history that can’t be
beat and the Clemson team is very con-
fident, so-the struggle promises to be
full of fight. Saturday morning the
carefully prepared program of the Dra-

_matic Club will be given together with
| Senior speaking, the faculty having made

Major Hearn and the other officers’ the whole day a holiday.

seem pleased with the way in which the
new men are learning to execute the
manual of arms. With just a week or
so more of drilling it is certain that the,
Davidson College unit will be as neat in
appearance and as precise in the execu-
tion of orders as any in the state.
D

Many of the faculty were also over on

the side lines Saturday.

One of the most striking events of the
occasion will be the Senior reception
Saturday night. The girls will remain
on the hill over Sunday.

Dwight Chambers, with his able com-
mittee on arrangements, will assist in
securing rooms for visitors out in town.
The reception rooms at the Gymnasium
will be decorated and used as faithfully
as they were last year.
