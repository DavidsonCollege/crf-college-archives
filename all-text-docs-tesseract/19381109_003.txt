Question

of the Week

There

has been some discussion
the “Count ‘em Out”

yell that our cheerleaders used dur-

about new
ing the game last Saturday against
Wofford. better re-
sponse ‘to this yell than to any oth-

There was a
er yell used, but we found a few
boys who didn’t seem to like the
yell and the time at which it was
used. The of the week:
“What is your opinion of the ‘Count
‘em Out’ yell?” seemed to be the
obyious question to ask

question

Here are a few opinions gathered
from the boys over the campus:
Ed Cloyd, Senior:

Those the David-
son vs. Furman game were the first

who attended

to hear and the résults of the
“Count ‘em Out” yell. Furman scor-
ed and their supporters responded
by “Counting “em Out”. Then what
happened? The Wildcats got a lit-
tle angry and proceeded to quiet the

see

Purple Hurricane.
If that yell from the Furman
stands helped Davidson to win a

game, isn’t it entirely possible that
we might aid one of our opponents
in the same way? Therefore, I say
forget the “Count ‘em Out” yell
and have the entire Student body
place renewed vigor and power be-
hind those characteristic
yells which really support our team.
Ed Watkins, Junior:

“T think the “Cout ’em Out” yell
is a lot of fun. It may be instru-
mental in making our opponents
fight harder, but still it helps our
team, too. The “praise Allah” cere-
mony gets more response than any
other yell. And, too, everybody can
count. The Salem girls seemed to
like it. It’s O.K. by me.

Charles Martin, Sophomore:

The “Count 'em Out” yell is out
of place at To our op-
ponents it is just rubbing it in, and
it shows in every way a lack of
sportsmanship. When this yell is
given, just put yourself in the op-
ponents’ position.

I think and you will agree that
it must be abolished to keep our
ranks among the highest in sports-
manship.

B. B. Plyler, Junior:

Until the question was proposed,
I had given no particular thought to
it. I can see no reason for not hav-
ing the yell except when we score
too much and even then we could
count by fives.

Charlie Yates, Junior:

The “Count 'em Out” yell, as it
was tried at the Wofford game
seemed fine as a novelty, but as
a permanent yell I am opposed to
it.

A yell like this seems to me to be

comparable to cheering when op-
ponents are penalized or when an
opponent is injured. This I feel is
detrimental to the Davidson spirit.
“Apie” Means, Junior:

I was at the Furman game when
the new “Count ‘em Out” yell was
first adopted—copied from Furman
who first, tsed it when they were
in the lead. IT the
time how ungentle-

remember at

grating and
manly it sounded.
Davidson has always boasted of a
traditional spirit surpassed by none,
but that spirit has always upheld the
ideals of gentleman and has
as motivatng power to
forward, not as
a means of deliberately attempting
to humiliate
guests.

a

drive our team

our opponents and

We have always been proud of
the fact that all opposing teams
have commented on our spirit and
sportsmanship.

Would you want to destroy this
feeling by taking advantage of some
such superiority as we did inthe
Wofford game? The victory will
bring due credit, but the yell
will do much detract from it.
I, for one, hope that the yell will
not be used again.

us
to

Tom Cauble, Sophomore:
I feel that the new “Count
Out” yell is impractical in that it

‘em

sounds good only when we have
run,up a large score on some weak-
er team. And in that case, it would
not seem quite like sporting conduct.

I see nothing wrong with it, how-

ever, if we should hold the lead Charlotte, N. C.
over some favored opponent. .
