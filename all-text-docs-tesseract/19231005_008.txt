uses, mainly an aerial attack. They can}
be relied on to put out a fast, smooth- |
working machine. |

WILDCATS WIN IN CONTEST
WITH BARIUM ——

preserve the life and traditions of David-
son and never let them become lost, be-
cause traditions and honors are inval-
uable. By the word “light” is meant that
we can shine for Christ in no better place
than here. We can acknowledge Him
and at all times point others to the light
of the cross.

The talk was thoroughly enjoyed be-
cause it was so practical and was pre-
sented in such a clear, forceful manner.

PASTOR SPEAKS OF CHRIST’S
CHARACTER

Taking his text from I Peter 2:4, 5, Dr.
Richards spoke last Sunday on the sub-
ject of Christ as a Living Stone.. “For
those conscious of weakness we preach
Christ,” began Dr. Richards. “If power
is sought for personal aggrandisement,
it is pitiable; if to serve Christ, there. is
nothing more laudable.”

Dr. Richards pictured the author of
the text as being unreliable and impul-
sive. Peter promised never to forsake
Him, and yet he bitterly denied Him.
Christ asked, “Whom say men that I
am?” Peter answered, “Thou art Christ;
thou art the rock.” And Christ replied,
“Thou art Peter; thou art the rock, and
on this rock will I build my Church,”
Conscious of what people thought, i.e.,

i that he was the rock, Peter wrote these

words, “I write of the rock, Jesus Christ.
I say it is just as possible for you to be-
come a rock as me.”

Peter speaks of Him as a living rock,
making those who come to Him living
stones. Think of a rock as of power,
of permanence, of protection. A rock
standing through centuries, subjected to
weathering and after centuries the same
old rock. Jesus «is the same yesterday,
today, and forever,

MEN IN THE INFIRMARY FROM
LOWER CLASSES

The infirmary has been well patronized
since the opening of school; ten men

have taken time to visit there for a short
while. There have been no serious cases
of sickness, however, according to those
in charge of the ward.

The Freshmen have been well repre-
sented on the sick list; eight of the ten
who reported at sick-call were first year
men, The other two are said to be
Sophomores. These statistics show that
if one lives through his first two years
of college he is either quite immune from
sickness or has learned to take care of
himself. It has been suggested that the
new men have been getting too many
boxes of “eats” from home, and getting
rid of them too quickly. :

Those confined were: L. B. Hope, P,
F, Causy, E. Bohannon, J. C. Frierson,
D. Lanier, W. A. Brown, W. H. Dodge,
R. R, Glenn, F. H. Brooks, A. W. Alex-
ander.

What Do You Know About Fire
Insurance?

Question 1. Your home is covered
by fire insurance. The back porch is
destroyed by fire. The original cost of
the porch is estimated at $150, but it
has been in need of repair for some
time and when burned was worth only
$100. According to the terms of your
policy, what amount should the in-
surance company pay you? What
clause covers this? /

Answer: $100. Covered by clause in
contract proper on page one of New
York Standard Policy, which reads:
“, .. does insure (name of person at

THREE MEN ARE KILLED IN
DYNAMITE EXPLOSION

On September 27th, at the rock-quarry
near the Catawba River, an explosion of
dynamite took place which killed one
man instantly and wounded others, two
of whom died later.

It was thought that the quarry was
clear of loads, and the drill-operator let
his drill down into a hole which had been
left from some previous work. This set
off a charge of dynamite which was in
the hole, unknown to the operator.

The head and shoulders of the drill-
operator, a white convict, were blown
completely off. Two negro convicts sus-
tained fractured skulls and died a few
hours later, neither of them having re-
gained consciousness. The blacksmith,
a white man who was not a convict, was
badly shot up with pieces of stone. He
was carried to a hospital in Charlotte.
Will Prim, a guard, was slightly wound-
ed in the head by stones, and others sus-
tained minor injuries.

length of the field. One of these passes
gained nearly forty yards, being one of
the few bright spots of the game.

Another feature was a drop-kick from
the forty-yard line by Dick Grey the
local quarter-back. This made a total
of 19 points for him of the 37 made by
the home team. There were no in-
dividual stars for the Kittens, every man
playing on a par, while the playing of
Jackson stood out for Barium.

WALKER MAKES SPLENDID
TALK TO VOLUNTEER MEN

Immediately after the “Y” service Sun-
day evening, Joe Walker gave an inter-
esting and helpful message to the Volun-
teer Band.

His message was centered around
three important words, used so many
times by Christ in His application of
truths, “leaven,” “salt” and “light.” His
object was to show the application and
relation of these three words to our own
student body.

With the word “leaven” he showed
how we, as individuals, are as molecules
of leaven in the bread, which in time
shouJd make the bread rise. So are we
the life of the campus and are expected
to make life here grow and develop.
“Salt” is a preserving agent. The appli-
cation to campus life is that we always
