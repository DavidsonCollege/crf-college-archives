FEC Ratifies Calendar
With Unbroken Term

By THOM NICOLL
Asst. Managing Editor

Scrapping a tentative calendar
for 1972-73 which scheduled
classes on January 1 and which
would again split the winter
term with the Christmas recess,
the Faculty Executive Commit-
tee (FEC) approved Wednesday
a plan by which the winter
term will begin after Christmas
on January 2.

The revised calendar, formu-
lated by John M. Bevan, vice
president for academic affairs,
will delay the opening of the
fall term until Sept. 21 rather
than Sept. 6 as had been plan-
ned. Commencement will be held
on June 3 rather than on May
20.

Next year’s Christmas break
will begin on December 9 and
classes will not resume until the
winter term starts on January

Bevan pointed to a new fea-
ture of the calendar, the Col-
lege Conference Recess which
will occur on Oct. 26 and = 27
after five weeks of the fall
term. The two days are espe-
cially intended for students to
talk at length with their advis-
ors and professors.

“This will allow us to do more
of the type of thing that a small
college should be doing, espe-
cially for the freshmen. It will

also give more breathing time
during the first term as com-
pared to the original plan,” Be-
van explained.

The new calendar will include
Thanksgiving holidays on Nov.
23 and 24. A week-long break is
scheduled between the winter
and spring terms. Both the win-
ter and spring terms will in-
clude one Saturday on which
classes will be held so that each
term will contain exactly 50
class days.

Bevan surveyed the faculty
for their reactions to the revi-
sions and found that among
those who responded, the revis-
ed plan was favored 3 to 1.

According to Bevan, an alter-
native plan would have been to
start earlier and to schedule
five weeks of the winter term
before and five weeks after the
Christmas break. However, this
would have rushed the first part
of the year for no real advan-
tage, he explained.

Student ‘reactions to the revi-
sicas were mixed. SGA Presi-
dent. Ralph Peeples said that it
was ‘not a bad plan.” He dis-
approved of having to return on
Jan. 1, but said that would be
better than Dec. 31.

Peeples said, “‘I don’t see
what’s so sacred about having
50 class days; that’s why class-
es are scheduled for Jan. 2.
Traveling on New Year’s Day

can really be dangerous. I might
come a day or two late myself.

“Not getting out until June 3
could be a_ disadvantage in
terms of getting summer jobs.
However the long Christmas
break will be an advantage for
getting jobs then.

“I don't think that a_ split
term works anyway, and I think
that the College Conference
break is am excellent idea.”

Freshman Steve Dodd said, ‘‘I
like the kind of calendar we
have now better. I don’t see
how the split term is such a
disadvantage. Personally, the
new plan will destroy a lot of
my vacation plans, I can also
see a real disadvantage in get-
ting summer jobs.”

SGA Vice President Bob Cun-
ningham approved the new plan,
saying, ‘‘I like this much better
than the split term. I also like
being able to finish exams early
in December and not having to
Start the new term until Jan-
uary. This summer will really
be good, since we get through
in early May and won’t have to
come back until Sept. 21.”

Freshman Senator Bob Cor-
lew said that he would prefer
to start earlier and get out
earlier. He also pointed out that
getting out later will mean in-
creased competition for sum-
mer employment.

RHC Accepts Responsibility
For Off-Campus Residence

By MIKE TANNER
Asst. Managing Editor

Dean of Students Will Terry,
Director of Student Housing
Scotty Nicholls and the Student
Life Committee (SLC), have
transferred the responsibility of
selecting tho-e students who will
be permitted to live off-campus
to the Residence Hall Commit-
tee RHC), in an effort to make
the selection process impartial.

According to SGA vice presi-
dent Bob Cunningham, the se-
lection in the future will re-
volve solely around a_ set of
priorities newly-established by
the RHC, which will determine
in what order students applying
for off-campus housing privi-
leges will be allowed to follow
through with their plans.

These priorities are as fol-
lows: 1) married students, 2)
Students with a medical or emo-
tional problem, 3) Students who
have the availability of rent-free
housing, 4) Students who have

son will be gone for a portion
of the academic year.

Priority six imcludes seniors
in no academic or disciplinary
difficulty, and priorities seven
and eight follow likewise for
members of the junior and soph-
omore classes respectively.

Priorities one through five
are considered the major ones
and any student qualifying un-

der any of these will automat-

ically be allowed to move off
campus. Those applicants not
qualifying under any of the first
five, beginning with the senior
class and moving down the
ranks to the sophomore class,
will be placed in a lottery in
order to fill the remainder of
the off-campus spaces.

Cunningham pointed out, how-
ever, that the RHC has nothing
to say about the number of stu-
dents who will be living off-
campus but rather, only who
those students will be. The
number of off-campus dwellers
is determined every year by
subtracting the number of avail-
able dormatory places from the
projected enrollment.

‘‘We won't be able to get ev-
eryone off campus who would
like to be but this new system
does further student involve-
ment and provides impartial se-
lection,” Cumningham said.

Will Terry expressed definite
approval of the transfer of re-
sponsibility. ‘It’s my conviction
that students should be permit-

ted to handle matters of this kind
as often as possible. The RHC
expressed a willingness and de-
sire to handle off-campus hous-
ing.

‘‘We have gone over together
the criteria and procedure for
off-campus housing and they
seem to be dealing with the
matter in a business-like and
thorough fashion,” he continued.
“It is my hope that students
will respond to this positively
and will continue to deal with
the matter fairly.

Symposium.

Symposium Staged
For Asian Problems

By RICHARD ROMEYN
Staff Writer

The changing balance of pow-
er in Asia was the topic dis-
cussed in a symposium Wednes-
day evening.

Professors Fredrick Gage and
William Jackson, who organized
the forum, feel that there is
“the need for the Davidson com-
munity to be informed concern-
ing the shifting roles of the ma-
jor powers in Asia.”

The first speaker, Dr. Thom-
as Robinson of the Council on
Foreign Relations began the
discussion with observations on
“China’s Relationship to the
Rest of Asia’.’

In discussing the recent trip
of President Nixon to The Peo-
ples Republic of Chima, Robin-
son concluded that agreements
reached during talks there will
cause a shift in the power struc-
ture in Asia. In his opinion the
so-called ‘‘Shanghai Communi-
que” marks the beginning of a

‘“‘protoalliance” between the
United States and China. This
along with other factors could
cause an ‘‘understanding” be-
tween the other powers in Asia,
Japan and the USSR. Robinson
folesees that the interaction of
the four powers will create a
balance of power in Asia which
he feels would be the most sta-
ble form of alignment.

Robinson concluded that the
agreements reached by the
United States and China will
perpetuate am era of peaceful
coexistence between the two
countries. However, he express-
ed concern that US-China rela-
tions might deteriorate with the
death of Mao, causing a power
shift in favor of the Soviet Un-
ion.

Other speakers at the sympo-
sium were Dr. George Williams.
of Notre Dame _ University,
speaking on the role of the So-
viet Union in Asia, and former
Davidson professor Dr. John
Fuller, who spoke on the role of
the United States in the area.

Accelerated Program Allows
Students To Graduate Early

By BRUCE MALOY
Staff Writer

This Tuesday, College Presi-
dent Samuel R. Spencer, Jr.,
said the Program for Accelera-
tion which was recommended by
the Educational Policy Com-
mittee (EPC) has been approv-
ed by the faculty and is now in
effect.

This program allows students
who meet the requirements to
get a degree in three years and
one summer by taking four
courses per term.

Vice President of Academic
Affairs John Bevan pointed out
that the unique aspect of this
program is that there is no ex-
tra charge for the fourth course

as there was previously. “‘This
means that a student can get a
four-year education at three-
year prices,” stated Bevan.

When asked if this program
points to a trend in higher edu-
cation, Bevan replied, ‘‘In the
fifties and sixties there was a
movement toward three-year
graduation as the result of in-
creasing enrollment and econom-
ic problems. The most popular
three-year degree program was
the tri-mester or summer se-
mester plan.

“This system never was very
effective for a variety of rea-
sons,” Bevan continued. ‘‘It in-
creased costs, the poorer stu-
dents tended to go to the sum-

mer semester; and the draft
caused many people to increase
rather than decrease their time
in college.”

Bevan went om to say that no
more than five per cent of any
class will be allowed to accele-
rate at first in order to prevent
a financial crisis caused by a
decline in the number of stu-
dents. He added that once it, is
clear that the admissions can
keep pace with the students
graduating early that this limit
will probably be modified.

Students desiring to accelerate
must have maintained a 3.0 av-
erage for each of the two pre-
ceding terms and must have the
consent of the Curriculum Re-
quirements Committee,
