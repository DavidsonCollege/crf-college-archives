Patterson Court Council Proposes Alcohol Policy Changes
Monitoring, Times of Parties, and Weekday Parties Emphasized by Court Committee

By Mandy Curtis

In a meeting of the CCRL on
Thursday, April 1, revisions of the
current alcohol policy presented
by the SGA, Patterson Court Coun-
cil, Residence Life office, and the
Dean of Students office were re-
viewed. Among the revisions the
Patterson Court Council has pro-
vided three main amendments to
the policy that would reassert the
responsibility of the houses on the
court.

Since January, the PCC, made

Sexual Assault
Victims "Take
Back the Night"

By Leigh Rawdon

On Tuesday, March 30,
Davidson students "took back the
night" asthe third annual ceremony,
held in the 900 Room, focused on
individual experiences of sexual
- assault to promote awareness
among the student body. The pro-
gram intended to allow emotional
responses rather than mere intel-
lectual discussion about the conse-
quences of rape and molestation.

Senior Sara Carlson organized
the Davidson event for the third
year based on the national Take
Backthe Nightprograms. She notes
that, “Every year we see an in-
creasing awareness in the student
body and in the faculty that makes
Take Back the Night more neces-
sary and effective.” She empha-
sized thateachof the speakers com-
mented on the importance of active
programs like the Rape Awareness
hall meetings.

Approximately 150 students
sat on the floor of the 900 Room to
participate by supporting and learn-
ing about those in the program as
well as those victims who did not
speak. Audience members were
asked to wear blue string bracelets
out of respect for victims as well as
totie blue ribbons toa tree torecog-
nizeany friendor acquaintance who
has been assaulted.

Statistics reveal that one of
every four college women are vic-
tims of rape or attempted rape,
making sexual assault more com-
mon than left-handedness. The
majority of victims are between the
ages of 15 and 24, while rapists
usually fall between the ages of 16
and 25.

The program included perfor-
mances by talented Davidson stu-
dents in support of their peers.
SophomoreB.J.Rudell, who reada
poem, explained that he recognized
the importance of the event when
he heard about a friend who had
been assaulted. Freshman Laura

up of the presidents and treasurers
of the fraternities and eating houses,
has been working to provide revi-
sions of the alcohol policy. Their
final assessment of the policy as
observed since the start of the year
was submitted to the CCRL two
weeks ago along with additional
provisions which, .if approved,
would be implemented next year.

The proposal from the PCC
States that the alcohol policy was
“designed to encourage responsible
drinking and a more positive

Patterson Court atmosphere.”
However, the PCC feels that in-
stead, the policy has created a re-
sentment of the administration
among the students.

The council wants a policy
that the students have helped to
create ratherthan the current policy
which they feel has been imposed
upon the students and enforced
from the outside. As stated in the
proposal, the council would like to
see a policy that is based primarily
on“risk management.” This would

provide for the protection of the
students and for a self-regulating
system.

According to PCC advisor
Kurt Holmes, there are three main
aspects of the PCC proposal that
the council has emphasized. They
include alcohol monitoring, times
of parties, and weekday parties.

Alcohol monitoring is felt to
be the biggest of the three con-
cerns. The council stated that pres-
ently the monitor system is not
well-respected. The PCC recom-

mended a monitor policy that is
“partially internal, encouraging
better communication between all
monitors and providing support
among Patterson Court members
forarisk-freesocial environment.”

According to Holmes, the PCC
proposed that there be a single
college-hired alcohol monitor, two
Patterson Courthouse “risk” moni-
tors provided by the sponsoring
houses, and one Davidson College

week heralded the arrival of Maya Angelou,
the celebrated poet who read her poetry at
President Clinton’s inauguration. Her beam-
ing face hung on every bulletin board and
around every comer of Chambers .and the
Union, drawing attention and crowds to the
1992-1993 Reynolds Lecture. But what Maya
Angelou gave us in Love Auditorium on
Wednesday, March 31 at 8 p.m. was less
lecture than song. .

After being introduced by President
Kuykendall, Angelou took the podium and
lifted her voice to sing in several different
languages. When she finished with foreign
languages she picked up with English and
continued to sing and enlighten the audience
for the next hour and a half.

She started by speaking of love: filial,
erotic, romantic, and self-love. Angelou first
used African-American poetry to discuss these
different kinds of love.

“The woman I love is fatand chocolate to
the bone, and every time she shakes, some
skinny woman loses her home,” Angelou re-
cited from a 19th century folk song.

Maya Angelou spoke in Love Auditorium the evening of March 31.

Swatches of her fascinating life came
through in her talk as she described what it was
like to be acast member in a touring version of
“Porgie and Bess.” While the company was in
Morocco, Angelou wasasked to sing acapella.
“When I finished, 4,500 Arabs jumped up and
started to shout it with me. I stood there, my
knees locked up. I didn’t know what to do.”

Before taking on Europe and Morocco,
however, she first had to live through a child-

hood in Stamps, Arkansas. At 12 years of age,
she decided to recite some poetry for her
church. After memorizing whole scenes of
Shakespeare, she selected Portia’s speech in
The Merchant of Venice. There was one small
problem, however — a six and a half foot
grandmother who wasn’t so sure about this
Shakespeare character. According to Angelou,

Photography Not Included in New Visual Arts Center

By Mary McCrory

When students enter the com-
pleted visual arts center next fall,
they will find painting, drawing,
and sculpture studios, etching and
lithography classrooms, gallery
space, and a lecture hall at their
disposal. They will not, however,
find a photography program or a
darkroom facility awaiting them.

If Davidson had a workable
darkroom facility already, this
would not bea large concem. The
conditions of the only darkroom
on campus, which is located in the
basement of the Union, are far from
ideal. According to Kristina
Nevius, “It’s incredibly hot be-
cause it’s next to the boiler room,
and there is only one enlarger, so
you can’t ever develop prints and
film at the same time.”

Finding such conditions frus-
trating, and disappointed that the
art department offers no photogra-

phy classes, freshman Kristina
Nevius decided to do something
about it.

In hopes of demonstrating stu-
dent interest in a photography pro-
gram at Davidson, she addressed a
petition to Dean Terry calling fora
darkroom facility inthe Visual Arts
Center.

All together, 156 people
signed it, but eventually Nevius
stopped petitioning, finding that
the problem was not lack of inter-
est but lack of money. There is
enough interest that space already
has been set aside in the Visual
Arts Center, but so far no. one has

stepped forward to endow a pho-—

tography professorship or to equip
the 500 square feet of allotted dark-
room space.
According to Herb Jackson,
Professor of Art, such project
would cost approximately $2 mil-
lion. “Right now there is only a

cinderblock wall. To finish out
the space into a darkroom facility
with the right equipment is expen-
sive.”

Although a darkroom in the
Visual Arts Center will have to
wait, there are other possibilities
for photography at Davidson.
Nevius is optimistic about im-
provement, since she has been told

that the existing facility may be
improved if she will submit a pro-
posal to the Activities Tax Coun-
cil. Money for such a renovation
would go through the Davidsonian
and Quips and Cranks. budgets.
Also, William Brown, Director of
the Union, has expressed interest
in creating darkroom space in a
new College Union.
