Three Prepare For Trip To Africa

By Meredith Boone

While most Davidsonians have
already settled into the daily grind
of classes, parties, and occasional
study sessions, some students are
still at home, trying to decide just
what one packs when going off to
Africa. Three Davidson juniors,
Lara Teal, Heather Tarpley, and
John Rowe, have chosen to spend
the fall semester in a unique study
abroad program. The Wildlife
Biology and Range Management
program in Kenya, offered by the
School for Ficld Studies, allows
ordinarily mild-mannered college
students to apply their textbook
knowledge to a practical research
situation in an exOlic setting.

The program is sect up on a
research facility located on the only
privately owned game ranch in
Kenya. The research is done witha
goal in mind, and the students
contribute to the overall body of
knowledge as they learn. While
students take classes six days a
weck, they also participate in small,
individual research groups which
study one particular elementof the
overall project. The purpose of the

game ranch is to discover how to
maximize Kenya’s natural food
resources without destroying the

wildlife ecosystem. So, although

the students do get away for a few
safaris, they do not studying typi-
cal lions, tigers, or bears.

The students/researchers spend
much of their ume studying the
effects of non-predators such as
giraffe, gazelle,andzcbraoncattle.

. Interestingly, when cattle are

housed with natural wildlife, the
cattle inflict far less damage on the
land than they ordinarily would.
The long term goal of the game
ranch and research center is to
discover the best proportions of
cattle to wildlife so that these pro-
portions may be maintained
throughout the nation and Ken-
yans will be able to use these find-
ings to their advantage.

To finance the research center,
the owners “crop” 30 of the wild
animals per week in the on-site
slaughterhouse and sell the meat
to a tourist restaurant in Nairobi.
Some of the research determines
how many animals may becropped
and what effects this cropping has

on the social structures of various
specics.

This year, the program director |

withdrew on short notice, and the
program was in jeopardy as the
administrators struggled to find a
replacement. When a South*Afri-
can professor was found, there was
much concern that, since Kenya
has only very recently recognized
the South African government, the
prospective director may not have
been able to geta visa. Fortunately,
because of South Africa’s recent
reforms, the Kenyan government
was willing to grant the visa, thus
saving the program.

When asked to describe her
experience in Kenya last fall, sen-
ior LeAnn Simmons called it“very
interesting” but “rigorous.” In
addition to living without electric-
ity in thatched huts, the students do
all the cooking themselves. How-
ever, in spite of this as well as the
countless pre-trip medical visits and
difficulties in packing, these three
students are eager to begin their
African adventure: an experience
that they expect to be incredibly
rewarding.

Love Of Learning Program
Inspires Students And Teachers

By Prem Manjooran

The Love of Learning program,
the brainchild of one of the truly
remarkable individuals here at
Davidson, Brenda Tapia, has
evolved beyond her wildest hopes.
Five years after the pilot class first
came to Davidson, the program
has become not merely a fixture,
but it has emerged as a genuine
effort to coalesce the facilities our
campus has to offer with the crea-
tive talents and output of some of
Charlotte- Mecklenburg’s bright-
est and best.

The students that attend the
program during the month of July
are highly motivated individuals,
talented and gifted, and more
importantly, aware of their rela-
live strengths and weaknesses.
They are quite determined to trans-
late that immense latent potential
into tangibly appreciable terms. It
is indeed a revelation, to compare
the students thatattend some of the
other programs thatrun simultane-
ously with the Love of Learning
students. These students are strug-
gling to combat the handicaps of
their background and are success-
fully elevating themselves above
the rut that threatens the average
high school student in the state
system.

A lot of the program’s success
stems from the rigorous and struc-
tured format that permeates the

program. Every moment of the
day iscarefully budgeted and filled
with some sort of activity. Break-
fast is at 7 am; so the day starts
really early -- try 6:15 for starters!
Classes commence at 8 am and
run through noon, broken up only
by amandatory library study hour
at 10 am. A lunch/nap break is
assigned from noon until 2 pm,
after which the students split into
two groups. One group goes to

_Baker for a two hour session of

physical activity. The second
group goes to class, and at 4 pm,
the groups switch. After dinnerat
6pm, they all head back to class at
7 pm. Study Hall and a free hour
are followed by lights out at 11:30
pm.
The program’s primary focus
is unabashedly academic and there
are absolutely no excuses offered
for the work-loads imposed. The
momning session is devoted to Math
and English while the afternoon
classes are in the sciences. The
program, designed to develop and
focus the students’ competitive
edges in terms of the forthcoming
academic year, also provides them
with the individual attention and
tutoring which they do not have
access to during the school year.
The net result is a more aware and
qualified classroom candidate, and
astudentthat can effectively com-
pete on merit alone, for those pre-

cious few seats in demanding and
competitive colleges in the coun-
try. .
Just as the program makes a
commitmentto the students in terms
of helping them be “the best they
possibly can,” the students in turn,
make a commitment to the pro-
gram to return each summer, until
they graduate from high school,
and to give the program their best
efforts and talents, so that their
potential might be tapped and chan-
neled along more effective and
competitive lines. There isno more
appropriate testimony to the suc-
cess of the program than the new-
found willingness of several pri-
vate sponsors to provide the finan-
cial assistance the program so sorely
needs.

On apersonal level, asa part of
a team of 18 Counselor-Mentors,
the month I spent with the Love of
Learning program this summer
ranks very high among my more
productive and rewarding experi-
ences here at Davidson. I was quite
ashamed of the opportunities that
some of my friends and I have
squandered over the last three years
at school, while there are these
incredible kids, hoping for an op-
portunity to go to a school like
Davidson, and knowing that for
financial or other reasons, it will be
ahard struggle. —

And the loss, I think, is ours.

Did you find drop/add particu-
larly painful this time around? If
sO, you weren’t alone. The Regis-
trar’s office postponed drop/add
until Monday at 1:30 due to a
computer hardware malfunction.
When Sue Ross relayed this mes-
sage on Friday to a waiting line of
students the moaning began:

“Drop/add has been an abso-
lutely miserable experience.” ~

“This is amusing.” -Marie Hunt-
