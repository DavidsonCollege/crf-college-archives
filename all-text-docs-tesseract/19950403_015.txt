IN THE SPOTLIGHT — AGAIN

Big Game

from page 1 $

Davidson host the game.

“Despite being favorably com-
pared with Atlanta, we’ re not plan-
ning at this time to bid for the 2004
Olympics,” he joked. (Atlanta will
host the 1996 Summer Olympics.)

The game comes directly on
the heels of the NCAA Soccer
Championships, which ended a
three-year run here in December.
Last fall, Davidson hosted the
“Game of Week,” a 10-game pack-
age featuring the best college teams
in the country. Last spring,
Davidson played host to the men’s
World Cup team for its tune-up
against Moldavia.

Students will have an oppor-
tunity to purchase tickets. for the
“game on Friday, one day before
they go on sale to the general pub-

lic. At $8, the tickets will be avail-
able to students, faculty and staff
on a first-come, first-served basis
that day.

Those tickets are for seats lo-
cated next to the premium seats
which will go for $15. But, if
students jump early, they should
be able some very good seats.

No additional seating will be
added for the game, leaving capac-
ity at Richardson Field at about
5,300. The women’s team has
been drawing between 1,500 and
2,200 fans in games earlier this
year in small markets and drew

10,000 for a game in Dallas.

Sargent said he hopes, and
expects, to draw about 4,000 fans.
He said he expects the student tick-
ets to go quickly beginning Friday
morning.

As anadded bonus, that week-
end in April is also Alumni Week-
end, giving the many alumni who
return one last event before they
leave Sunday.

Sargent jump-started the pro-
cess to host the game about three
months ago by calling the USSF to
._ see if the organization was inter-
ested. He called about one month
ago to remind them of the idea, but
considered the chances remote that
a game would be played here.

Then, Thursday morning at
about 7:15 a.m., the events direc-
tor of the USSF called Sargent and
told him the USSF was interested
in playing a game at Davidson.
The deal was then finalized at about
1 p.m. Friday.

Davidson does not receive any
revenue from the game beyond a
rental fee, but gets a bundle of
exposure, especially in the soccer
world. The USSF, as the NCAA
did for the final four, will likely
hire many people at Davidson to
run the event.

“We were fortunate to have
done the other things because that
gave us national recognition,”
Sargent said. “Hosting the U.S.
exhibition against Moldavia helped
us to get to know the people at the
USSF. . .. We’ve worked with all
of them before. They know that
our system works.”

- “It’s kind of surprising how it

all happened,” he added. “Nobody —

thought we would get the college

championships the first time, but
since then, one thing has built on
another. For most people, one
month isn’t enough time to get
everything ready, but we’ve de-
veloped an infrastructure, and our
people have experience.”

Unlike the men’s team when
it played here before about 4,000
fans, the women’s team that shows
up will be the same as the one that
goes to Sweden. The men’s team,
on the other hand, featured only
some of the players that eventually
made the final roster.

Some of the top players in-
clude Mia Hamm, Tisha Venturini,
Michelle Akers-Stahl and Kristine
Lilly, all of whom played at North
Carolina, which has absolutely

dominated women’s collegiate soc-
cer for the last 10 years.

The women’s team won the
World Championships, the
women’s equivalent to the World
Cup, for the first time four years
ago by rolling over its competition
in China, outscoring its opponents
25-5.The championship marked
the first time that any U.S. soccer

team has won a world title. Akers-

Stahl scored 10 goals in the 1991
tournament.

That team was coached by
Anson Dorrance, also the Tar Heels
coach. At one time, half of the
national team’s roster was made
up of then-current or former North
Carolina players. Now, Tony
DiCicco heads the team, but Tar

Heels still dominate, comprising
seven of the team’s 18 players.

The U.S. will compete in
Group C in the World Champion-
ships, along with China, Australia
and Denmark. The tournament
runs in much the same fashion as
the World Cup, with teams ad-
vancing after round-robin play to
the single-elimination rounds.

So far this spring, the women’s
team is 3-1-1. The Scandanavian

women’s soccer teams have tradi- -

tionally been recognized as the
world’s best, and Finland is no
exception.The U.S. team, however,
is strong once again, and, as it
boasts some of the top soccer play-
ers in the world, is expected to
contend for the world title again.
