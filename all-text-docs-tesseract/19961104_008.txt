OPINIONS.

MONDAY, NOEMBER 4, 1996

Please entertain me by hear-
ing these proposals which might
improve life in the United States of
America. First, the voting process
stinks. Nobody is satisfied, there
are not enough candidates, and each
vote isn’t worth doo-doo, right?
Two separate elections with a run-
off between the top two vote get-
ters would reduce this pessimism.
In the first election, people could
vote for anyone, regardless of their
chance of being elected.

For example, I like neither
President Clinton nor Bob Dole.
If I chose to vote in the initial
election for Harry Brown, some-
one I prefer but realize will not
win, I wouldn’t take a vote away
from a candidate who could win.
For all the Perot fans out there,
you could vote your heart in the
first election and then vote for ei-
ther Dole or Clinton after you real-
ize that your man will always come
in third. In the second election, the
vote would be more valuable be-
cause there would only be two
candidates. The winner would
automatically have a majority, and
people could vote for their second
favorite candidate instead of tak-
ing votes away from that candi-
date as occurs with one general
election right now.

Second, we complain a lot
about the environment, so let’s do
something about it. Recycling is
great, but it is expensive and
laborious. Why not tax the hell out
of items which are sold in difficult-
to-recycle material? This would
either encourage manufacturers to
invent more environment-friendly

products or provide enough money

to recycle those items. How come
beer manufacturers don’t sell beer
in plastic containers? Maybe a tax
on their use of bottles would en-
courage them to try using plastic.
Also, we should increase incen-
tives to recycle by taxing people
who do not. This can happen at the
grocery store, for example. By
bringing in old 2-liter Coke bottles,
a shopper would be

won’t have to pay much more.
Actually, it might do us some good
to gradually reduce our use of the
bottle. The extra tax money could
goto health care, mostly to pay for
those with health problems related
to their smoking habits. As it is
now, healthy people pay more for
non-healthy people, many of
whom are smokers and alcohol

country, whether it be Peace Corps,
the military, or civil service, would
force people from all backgrounds
to work together for the good of

our country. Young men and

women who have to complete this
year of service between the im-
pressionable ages of 17 and 25
might learn a lot from each other.
We need to integrate all races, so-

cial classes, religions,

exempt from the tax
on the Coke product.
Or, by recycling large
bottles of beer, the
price of the un-pur-
chased beer would be
significantly less. Be-
sides shot-gunning,
what is the point of
beer in small cans or
bottles anyway?
Don’t we all prefer it
in a glass? And have
you heard of anything
more ridiculous than

and ethnicities to bet-
ter understand each
other. Learning from
personal relationships
is far better than Ricki
Lake’s version of race
relations. Soldiers in
battle seem to connect
and unite despite ex-
treme differences in
- the interest of the coun-
try. It does not take an
army united in combat
for people to become
united, however. If

pony bottles?
Hmmn, let’s see how
much glass we can produce so that
someone can drink a shot of beer
and then openanew bottle. Larger,
recyclable containers save a lot of
material. :

Next, our health is awful.
People eat, drink, and smoke too
much. The government already
taxes tobacco and alcohol, but we
should tax them even more. Now,
don’t threaten me just yet. Any-
one who uses tobacco shouldn’t.
If you are willing to pay more in
order to use tobacco, so be it. If
you are not, you might just save
your life. And as for us beer drink-
ers, if we recycle our bottles, we

abusers. If people have enough
money to pay for these products
after the tax increase, it follows
that the rich are taxed more due to
their preference for expensive
goods, not by government force.

Finally, we are a fragmented
society. We have made great
strides in terms of attempting to
put everyone on an even playing
field, but we still have not broken
many barriers. The reactions to
the Rodney King andO.J. Simpson
verdicts both show the extreme
race-based division which de-
stroys unity in this country. A
mandatory year of service to the

people from different
backgrounds were
forced to work together toward
improving the country, don’t you
think we .could reduce violence
based on race or creed? By better
understanding the plights and as-
pirations of a diverse group of
people, we could use diversity as a
means for unity.

How does all this relate to
Davidson? If Davidson is a micro-
cosm of the United States, we share
many of the same dilemmas. Look
at how much material we waste
each weekend at parties. We are
forced to have a certain number of
cans for each 21-year old, and then
we are ordered to pour the contents

of the can into a plastic cup. If we
must pot use kegs, we should be
able to drink the beer straight from
the can and then recycle the can
afterwards. The school could re-
ward fraternities and eating houses
which recycle, such as a reduction
in fines or a ‘get out of jail free’
card in case they fail to register a
party on time, etc. And how many
times have we heard complaints
about race problems here? Just
walk into the Commons and you
will see the divisions. Although
classrooms and freshman halls at-
tempt to unite a motley mixture,
we have to admit this rarely hap-
pens. Perhaps mandatory commu-
nity service during the freshman
and sophomore years in small, di-
verse groups would improve race
relations here. These ideas are not
all mine, so don’t praise or blame
me entirely for presenting them to
you. Much of Latin America prac-
tices the policies of recycling, and
if I am not mistaken, France uses
the above electoral system. I be-
lieve that a trial run of these ideas
for two years would reduce prob-
lems and increase the quality of
life in this country. I would greatly
appreciate comments from anyone
concerning these ideas. I’m not
too proud for nasty criticism, but
unless you are Ross Perot or Ricki
Lake, we should be able to debate
in a polite way.

We should all become more
involved in the well-being of our
country. My ideas might sound
radical and scary, but I believe
they are practical and sensible.
Sometimes whatis sensible is scary
as well.

Greg Garrison

Fear and Self-Loathing in Cyberspace

You know, sometimes you
might feel like you’re a tool, a
goof, a socially inept individual.
That’s okay — there’s a distinct
possibility that you are.

If you find yourself feeling
this way, and you know that other
people feel the same way about
you, I can offer you a few ways to
overcome these feelings of self-
loathing.

Now, at this point you may be -

saying, “Stop righthere, Greg. You
always make a joke out of every-
thing, and there’s nothing funny
about my’ self-deprecation.” This
may be true, but there is plenty
that’s funny about other people’s
self-deprecation. It’s okay — take
a look around and laugh. As your
parents have surely said, if you’d
only think about others once ina

while, you might be a little better —

off , wouldn’t you?

One way to feel better is to
become active in “raising the
community’s consciousness.” Do

something like putting signs that

read Hunger Affects... Everyone’

in restrooms around campus.
There’s nothing like reading such
a profound message while using
the pisser to raise a wo/man’s con-
sciousness and to make him/her a

glance around furtively every few
seconds.

Now, at this point I must say
something to those of you who are
reading this because you’re look-
ing for an excuse not to study,
rather than suffering from

an icy, hateful stare, but that’s just
their way of saying,“I won’t be
able to check out pictures of naked
sixteen-year-olds because I’m so
embarrassed by someone looking
over my shoulder, and my night’s
ruined, but I love you anyway.”

socially responsible indi-
vidual. :

This may seem like too
much work, or you might
not like taking stands on is-
sues in public restrooms or,
anywhere else. My advice
to you, then, is to check out
the internet. ae

If you’re a horny young
wo/man and feel like you
can’t’ alleviate this sexual
tension with another person,

é

If you don’t like -
your personality,

the ’net has
something for
you too.

If you don’t like your per-
sonality, the ’net has some-
thing for you too.

You can create a whole
new identity for yourself and
get to know other people
who have created whole new
identities for themselves.
Hell, you might even meet
that special someone and be
able to talk about “how I
met Mr./Ms. Right ona chat

or if you’re a repressed individual
who “wants to do research on por-
nography,” there’s plenty out there
to satisfy your aching loins. Sit in
the back row of one of the third-
floor Chambers computer labs,
spend hours on Netscape, and

toolishness. If you need to use a
computer to write a paper, head on
up to the IBM or Mac lab and type
it on one of the back-row comput-
ers. ;

The pervs who sit back there
most nights will probably give you

line,” instead of the oh-so-
boring stories that those of us who
are well-adjusted have or will
someday have.

If you can’t find a mate, try an
internet dating service. There are
plenty of other heartsick people
out there, and at least one of them

will surely be lonely enough to
accept you for who you are, don’t
you think?

If you just don’t want to admit
that junior high is over, you can go
play a Dungeons-and-Dragons-
type game and live in a fun little
fantasy world comprised of wiz-
ards and demigods. Hot damn,
wouldn’t that be fun?

Finally, if you are in love with
Barbara Streisand or Kenny G and
don’t feel like anybody around here
can identify with you, the ’net will
provide you with hours and hours
of joy as you find thousands of
other sickos worldwide who share
your taste in musicians.

Now, you may try these or
other options and still feel like
you’re a dork, but take solace in
the fact that there are plenty of
other dorks at this school who feel
the same way.

Don’t blame me if you’re a
loser. Ican try my best to help you,
but I’m not a miracle worker.
