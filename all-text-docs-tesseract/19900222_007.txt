Here are some
facts you may

not know

By MICHELLE SERRANO

1, Yesterday, Wednesday, February
21, was the anniversary of the 1965
assassination of civil rights activist
Malcolm X.

2. Egypt is in Northern Africa. (This
is of course very basic, butsome people
havea problem admitting this because
they don’t want toassociate Egypt with
Africa).

3. The Egyptian, Imhotep, was called
the “real father of medicine” because
he described the circulation of blood
4,000 years before Europe discovered
this bodily function.

4. The Angolan leader, Queen Ann
Nzinga, resisted the colonization of her
country by Portugal for40 years during
the mid-1600s.

5. Olduvai Gorge, in Kenya, East
Africa, is the site of the oldest human-
like fossils to have been fan by
archeologists.

These are just a few African-Ameri-
can History facts that have been left
out; so if in doubt--check it out. Be on
the lookout for more knowledge
throughout this month.

The above facts were taken from The

Glory: Finally, a tribute to black Civil War soldiers

_By RUSS MATTHEWS
STARS: Matthew Broderick,
Denzel Washington, Cary El-
wes, Morgan’ Freeman
DIRECTOR: Edward Zwick
RATING: * ** 1/2

Glory is the'true story of the
54th Massachusetts Infantry,
the first black regiment raised
by the Union to fight in the
Civil War. The potential be-
hind such a story makes you
wonder why no one ever
thought to make itintoa movie
before now. We should be
thankful however, that some-
one finally has and that they
have done an excellent job. The
result is a lavishly produced
spectacle in the finest Holly-
wood tradition, tempered by
the sensitivity, reverence and
attention to detail, absolutely
demanded by the landmark
subject matter.

With astory so rich in poten-
tial the film makers had a vari-
ety of themes to choose from.
The men of the 54th dealt with
their own mutual differences,
racial prejudice in the North as

well as the South, and the need’

to prove that blacks could fight
as well and as bravely as
whites. To their credit, the
filmmakers do not choose a
theme to on harp for the entire
movie. Instead they present a
finely detailed portrayal of the
men and their lives that allows
isd spesiaaaadl to caw its own

conclusions.

A majorcomplaintabout this
film has been that while it is a
story of blacks, the focus is
placed mainly ona white char-
acter. While thismay have been
a legitimate complaint with
such films as Cry Freedom and
Mississippi Burning, it is not so
with Glory. Glory is as much
about men at war as it is about
black history. The white char-
acter that serves to advance
much of the story is Col. Robert

Gould Shaw, the commanding
officer of the 54th. The leaderis .

often the most compelling
character in any story, espe-
cially when dealing with the
military, where a leader’s deci-
sions can mean life or death for
hundreds of others. Also, let-
ters written by Shawat the time
provided the best, most accu-
rate record of the daily life and

progress of the 54th.

Col. Shaw is played by Mat- —

thew Broderick. He is a good
choice, infinitely more satisfy-
ing than some square-jawed
mannequin from central cast-
ing. Broderick’s less-than-ma-
cho features remind the audi-
ence thatheis, afterall, just like
them. The difference is that
Shaw is weighed down by the
awesome responsibilities of
command and is desperately
trying to avoid failing in them.
Like his character, Broderick
also seems to be struggling
with his responsibilities, but

. unfortunately does not suc-

ceed quite as well. Most of the
time he looks uncomfortable in
his first grown-up role. His
dialogue is often labored and
marred by a bad attempt at a
Boston accent which he thank-
fully loses during key scenes.
The audience will tend to
overlook these flaws however,
due partly to Broderick’s ear-
nest effort, but mostly so that
they can enjoy the perform-
ances of Morgan Freeman and
Denzel Washington. Freeman
plays a former grave digger
whose quiet strength and un-
derstanding elevate him to the
vitally important position of
sergeant major. Washington is
Tripp, a runaway slave who
seethes with barely controlled
fury and lives only for his
chance to fight. This excellent
portrayal has been recognized
with a well deserved Oscar
nomination. | Attimessome
of the characters and situations
seem cliched. Like many other
war movies there is the com-
mander who is ruthlessly pre-
paring his men for the horrors
of combat, the second in com-
mand who questions his meth-
ods (Elwes), and the tough as
nails drill instructor. Also, asin
many Civil War movies we
find runaway slaves who were
whipped regularly and white
southerners who think that’s
the way it should be. These
thing: seem fh cucned to us, but

today’s audience mustremem-
ber that in 1863 it was all very
real.

In fact, one of the films great-

_eststrengthsis the realism with
‘which it portrays the era. Cos-

tumes, props and sets are all
meticulously detailed. This is
especially evident during a
scene in which the 54th parades
through the streets of Boston
while thousands of spectators
cheer. Not only technically
impressive, Zwick makes a
powerful statement simply by
showing the reactions of black
men, women and children in
the crowd. As the soldiers pass
by, we are struck with the full
force of what it means for the
others to see black men in uni-
form. In this and other ways
Zwick spans the 127 year-gap
and enables the modern audi-
ence to identify with people
whoare, insome FEAPEEN:) alien
to them.

Surprisingly, Zwick main-
tains this bond with audience
even during the battle scenes.
The sheer insanity of Civil War
tactics to our modern sensibili-

_ ties actually helps to heighten

thesuspense. Neat rows of men
line up scant hundreds of feet
from one another and trade
murderous. volleys with
single-shot muskets before
charging into desperate hand
to hand combat. The effect is as

_ exciting, intense and terrifying

as anything in Platoon or Full

Metal Jacket.

The final battle scene is per-
haps Glory’s greatest achieve-
ment. The 54th leads a near
suicidal assault on Ft. Wagner
in Charleston, South Carolina.
Zwick devotes just the right
amount of time anticipating
the battle, then throws us into
the fray. The night battle is daz-
zling and accompanied by a
stirring original score (per-
formed by the Boys Choir of
Harlem) that should have re-
ceived an Oscar nomination.
Mostsignificant ofall, is that by
this point we are no longer
conscious of the fact that the
men of the 54th are black. We
know only that they suffer and
so we suffer with them.

Glory isa fitting tribute to the.
achievement, courage, and
sacrifice of the men of the 54th
Massachusetts Infantry. In
years to come it will serve to
inspire generations of people,
black and white alike.
