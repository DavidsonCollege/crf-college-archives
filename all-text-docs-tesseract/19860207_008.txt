Sleeper album deserves second glance

By LEE EICHELBERGER

Kate Bush has been making records in
the U.K. for years now and her popularity
there has only increased, while here in the
U.S. she has never reached more than a
select audience. This situation might
change with her new album Hounds of
Love. The self-produced album, more than
three years in the making, is a rich collage
of aural styles and textures that invites re-
peated listening.

Hounds of Love works as a complete
album rather than a collection of songs, as
each track progressively reveals another
layer of Bush’s psyche. In the record’s
opener, “Running up that Hill (A Deal With
God),” Bush croons, “It doesn’t hurt me /
Do you want to feel how it feels?” as she
seems to invite the listener into the depths of

her dream-like: self-perception. Thus begins
this intriguing journey into Bush’s mind
where she shows herself as a child, “afraid
of what might be” and as a woman who
asks, “c’mon let me live”.

But it is not the lyrics which distinguish
this record, rather it is the overwhelming
aural power that Bush creates instrumen-
tally and vocally. Even lyrics that, by them-
selves, would appear trite , “You're like my
yo-yo / That glowed in the dark,” are over-
come when a song’s sound and arrangement
transcend them. The music’s power comes
from its texture and obvious craft; it oozes
with a sensuality that ears cannot deny. It is
based on a combination of keyboard and
rhythm arrangements, but Bush invigorates
this formula by adding unusual musical ele-
ments. From the traditional Irish arrange-

ments that flavor “Jig of Life” to the Grego-
rian choruses of “Hello Earth,” this sound is
completely original. It is dreamy without
being disengaging. Bush’s greatest instru-
ment, though, is her own voice which per-
meates each track and adds that emotional
“umph” that her lyrics lack.

If Bush borrows any musicaf tech-
niques, they are the rhythms, which resem-
ble recent peter Gabriel, and an emphasis
on sound effects which is very similar to
Pink Floyd. But Bush’s music doesn’t
alienate the listener in the way that Gab-
riel’s or Floyd’s does. In fact, the familiar-
ity that her melodies and silky voice evoke
is frightening. Ultimately, Bush's style is
just as indefinable as the styles of Peter
Gabriel or Pink Floyd, yet much more ac-

cessible.

In the final evaluation, though, the
music on Hounds of Love is beautiful and
powerful, it is not matched by the murky
lyrics. For Bush does not communicate lyri-
cally the passion that her music directly im-
plies. This is not to say that she cannot,
since “Under Ice” and “Jig of Life,” prove
that she can combine musical and lytic pas-
sion successfully. None-the-less, the sheer
aural impact of the album is astonishing.
And for this reason, the abscence of hard-
hitting lyrics is hardly noticeable as the lis-
tener is swept away in an aural ocean of
creamy melodies and cradled by Bush’s
vocals. Musically this album is flawless,
but it fails to be a great record since it is
grounded by underdeveloped lyrics.
