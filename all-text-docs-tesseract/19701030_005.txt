‘Where's That New Freshman?’

‘Paris In

By EMERSON BELL

During my four years ai
Davidson, I justified those
long hours of dedication and
dateless Saturday nights” by
dreaming about the = spring
of my senior year.

After discarding the usual
notions of orgies, drunken
brawls, etc. which every
Davidson senior contrives,
my mind became fixed on
“Paris in the Springtime.”

I'm not sure how I arriv
ed at this conception. The
only problem that I could
foresee was how to disguise
cleverly my Paris spree as
an acceptable plan of study.

Strategy move No. 2 ele-
vated my Davidson training
to its finest hour (this
scheme was quickly becom-
ing more challenging than
impressing a Sweet Briar
girl).

With the aid of the Bene

I discovered the Alliance
Francaise - a language
school in Paris that requires

only 80 franes ($16.00) to be

dent. I'd found my_ school..

It was only after receiving

soon threw myself into the

Of primary interest to the
Davidson mentality is the
fact that a bottle of wine

The whole ‘“riot’’ turned
into a big game of chase be-

Another weekend

I set out hitchhiking.

On Anonymous Petitions

To The Editor:

In the years that I have -

been at Davidson, I am sure
that I have read at least a
thousand petitions and edi-
torials which were mimeo-
graphed and stuffed wafer
my door.

I'll wager though that I
could count on my. right
hand the number of those
that were signed by the
authors.

The reason for this I can't
say. Yet it appears that at
campus
when debate and controversy
flourish, our school roster
seems to be composed not

of students with real names
but of 1000 AD HOC COM-
MITTEES.

While there are no ) legal
guidelines at Davidson con-
cerning the practice of sign-
ing our’ distributed litera-
ture, there should at least be
ethical guidelines from. a
personal standpoint. :

It is an unfortunate prac-

tice that we proliferate our

ideas so freely, yet rarely
dare to. be connected with
those ideas. Perhaps an
opinion worth expressing is
also worth claiming.
