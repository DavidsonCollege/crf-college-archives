‘Smoking is more of a habit

The French love to smoke.
Coffee and a smoke, dogs and

smoke. It always seems like it’s
puff away, every five seconds,
on a stub of burning weed. Back
home it’s the young and heal-

medical awareness about the
cancerous effects of cigarettes.
The “Mr. Coffee’ machines

connoisseur slowly fills his
daily fix. How does one find a
dealer? You have great variety
among the many assorted stu-
dent-populated cafes all around
town. The only catch is the
‘seventy-five cent to a buck
twenty-five price tag per cup,
and at that cost you need a lift
to get you through the day.

screeches to a dead halt to

Every detail you’ve ever
heard about French cuisine
from rich food to bizarre a la
anything, exists. Although usu-
ally the elaborate meals are
found only in expensive restau-
rants, the easiest delicacies to
be found are the abundant onion

* soup, quiche, and omelettes.

On the other hand, if you find

that the burned sauerkraut
didn’t turn out as you'd hoped,
there’s no reason to worry. Just
serve wine instead. It becomes
very clear in the first week in
France that at a little less than
a dollar a bottle, wine can be
used as a substitute for any

_meal or occasion whatsoever.

Montpellier is located seven
miles -from the Mediterranean,
but is surrounded by billions
and billions of friendly little
grapes. Those guys work all
year drinking in the local rain
and soaking up the beautiful
sun, just so that when the
Davidson group arrives each
year there’s always an abun-
dance of sweet alcoholic wine to
greet us. How’s that for not
needing an introduction?

Contrary to the fact that
mid-week wine soirees are more
frequent here, the work load has
been quite sufficient. The whole
month of September was spent
in four hour a day grammar
classes, which tied with four
hours a night of studying tend
to be a bit much. The two week
break in October was truly a
festival even for those who
didn’t get to the Oktoberfest,
yet the direction and intent of
our education has a different
focus.

Okay so it’s not.a Humes

- lecture or ‘God, another Eco
‘review.”’ Yet, in the routine of

every day we are struggling to
learn the ‘‘foreign’’ language, to
comprehend the French mind,
and to adapt to the strange
French ways. Rarely does a day
go. by without learning a new
word or finding a new ‘‘experi-
ence” (how we hate that word.)
Even building up the courage to
ask directions at a busstop or to
break the ice at dinner to meet a
Frenchie can be the most diffi-
cult and learning time of all.

Entwined in al} this worldli-
ness exists the warmth of the
small and personal experiences.
the post office presents a diffi-

-cult challenge to the rookie in

France. Not only is it obligatory:
to stand through three lines to
be told to return to the first (the
old circle game!), but one must
