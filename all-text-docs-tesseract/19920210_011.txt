These gifts are fundamental to the success of the project.

A$2 million dollar endowmentis required by the college, in addition
to the cost of the building. The interest accumulated on the endowment
will be included in every year’s budget in order to cover maintenance
expenses. Jackson explained that the function of the endowment is to
prevent hikes in tuition that would otherwise be required simply to
maintain the facility. As of now $5.5 million has been pledged.

If you are interested in more information about the building. or
donations, contact Laura Foxx in the Development Office at (704) 892-

be.

2. Trisha Yearwood - - A bold
statement, yes; unfounded, cer-
tainly not. She is the only female
artist in country music history to
have her debut single (“‘She’s In
Love With the Boy”) go number

one. Her voice is exciting, yet

beautiful. Garth brooks said it
best: “She could sell oil to the
Arabs with her voice”. Watch for
her to keep climbing.

3. Patty Loveless + - She has
come very close, but has never
really been the consensus reigning
queen. Her full-throttle, gut-
wrenching, yet still tender vocals
never fail to land her songs as hits,
and she won’t be giving up the
fight any time soon. Excellent
live.

4. Mary-Chapin Carpenter - -
The first on this list to’ write her
own material; and what clever,
gripping, caustic, and intricate
material it is. I especially recom-
mend her to you members of the
Davidson community. Not only
has she stayed just outside of main-
stream country with some folkier,
bluesier fare; but also she has writ-

*-ten material (much of which does

not make it to radio) for the intelli-
gent listener. Twice she has
stopped the show at the CMA
awards. She was the ACM’s best
new female in ’90 and has two
Grammy nominations this year.
Her music is outstanding; her live
show is dynamite; and she is
quickly getting national attention.
_ 5. Wynonna Judd - - Another
bold statement, considering her
first single has been on the radio a
few days. She no longer has her
charismatic mama by her side to
promote her; she’s on her own
now. - But, I always felt. that
Naomi’s presence held Wynonna
back in song selection, When it
comes to vocal talent and beauty,
she may be at the top.
6, Pam Tillis - - Keep an eye

on her. Her vocals are pleasing

and her writing is very clever and.

catchy. With “Don’t Tell Me What
To Do” under her belt and “Maybe
It Was Memphis” all over the radio
today, she is building a following.

7. Lorrie Morgan - - could be
underestimating this one, but she
seems to have lost a lot of ground.
She’s got the talent and the strong
backing of her record company,
but she’s:just not hitting the radio
the way she was a year ago.

8. Kathy Mattea - - Boy, talk
abouta slip. Last year, she was the
top female vocalist. Her new al-
bum is great, but she is not getting
any publicity, and she is not re-
cording commercial music. Often
accused of being too far from the
mainstream, the last move she
needs to make is to move further in
that direction.

9. Tanya Tucker - - Okay,
look. She’s bigger than this, and I

know it.. (This one falls into that
“personal preference” category).
Her older stuff was wonderful and
clever; I justdon’tthink she’s worth
all the hoopla she’s been getting.
I’m still bitter about her beating
Reba for best female at the CMA’s.

10. Holly Dunn - - Ever since
this summer, when “Maybe I Mean
Yes” was yanked from the radio
under the accusation that it en-
couraged acquaintance rape, Holly
Dunn has been a non-entity. Her
music; much of which she writes,
is great, though; look for her to
come back.

So, those are the top women in
country today as Isee it. Ihope you
agree (and I hope I didn’t leave
anyone out)! Come back next
week, and we’ Il check out the fell-
ers. (Garth will not be included in
this ranking so consider on your
own who the top guys are. . .)
