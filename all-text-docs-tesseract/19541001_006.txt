SERGEANT
SKETCH

One of the most experienced men
of the Davidson College R.O.
T.C. staff is M/Sgt. Clark M. Thaler,
who has had almost 16 years con-
tinuous service with the armed
forces in sundry capacities.

Sgt. Thaler finished school and
received his commission in 1938.
He entered the armed forces in
1939 with the 80th Field Artillery
Battalion, with which unit he ma-
neuvered throughout the South
during the winter of 1939-40.

He reported in August, 1940, to
Schofield Barracks, Hawaii, with
the Eighth Field Artillery Battal-
ion. This unit defended the Hono-
lulu sector after the Japanese at-
tack on Pearl Harbor.

Sgt. Thaler moved to Guadal-
canal with the 25th Division in
December, 1942, still attached to
the Eighth Field Artillery Bat-
talion. He was removed to New Zea-
land in June, 1943, for hospital
treatment and was returned to the
United States in November, 1943.

After two more months in a hos-
pital, Sgt. Thaler reported to 608th
Field Artillery Battalion at Camp
Carson, Colorado. After maneuvers
in California and training at Ft.
Benning, Ga., he departed for Eu-
rope in January, 1945. Crossing
Europe with the Third Army, Sgt.
Thaler was in Austria when the war
ended. He had several months oc-
cupation duty and returned to the
United States in August, 1945. -

Sgt. Thaler joined the 82nd Air-
borne Division in July, 1946, after
spending several months in train-
ing at different camps. He left Ft.
Bragg in August, 1949, to go to
Japan, where he joined the G4
section of Eighth Army Hq., Yoko-
hama. ;

In May, 1951, he joined the First
Cavalry Division in Korea, where
he assumed command of the 82nd
Field Artillery Battalion. Sgt. Tha-
ler remained in this capacity until
January, 1952, when he returned
to the United States.

Sgt. Thaler reported to Ft. Bragg,
where he remained until January,
1954. During this period. He com-
manded the 442th Field Artillery
Battalion observation at Ft. Bragg.

It was last January that Sgt. Tha-
ler was separated from active com-
missioned duty and reported to Da-
vidson. He has four more years to
serve with Uncle Sam, after which
time he plans to retire to a farm
near Boone, N. C. Sgt. Thaler's wife
is a former army nurse whom he
met in Hawaii. The Thalers are
now living in Mooresville with their
two sons, but they plan to move to
Davidson around Christmas.

recent years. These have been
made possible not only by a broad-
ening of the camera's artistic goals
and outlook, but by important
technological advances.

While the Salon has proved a
moving artistic experience to
thousands of viewers not actively
concerned with photography, it has
a particular attraction for fans be-
cause each photo is accompanied
by technical data describing the
camera settings and type of equip-
ment used in producing it.

Dr. W. G. McGavock, Davidson
Professor of mathematics, writes
from Madison, Wisconsin, that he is
engrossed in a year of studying on
his Ford Fellowship. The only trou-
ble with the place, he remarks, is
the search of his person that goes
on every time he leaves the univer-
sity’s library. Davidson has spoiled
him!

\Cotton Council Looks

For Maid Of Cotton

Memphis, Tenn. — An exciting
six-month international tour and a
fabulous wardrobe of 50 costumes
may be waiting for some cotton-
land college girl in 1955.

The National Cotton Council has
announced that the 1955 Maid of
Cotton contest now is open. And,
the Council says. Cotton Belt col-
leges have supplied 15 out of the
16 Maids in years gone by. If this
year’s contest runs true to form, it
is likely that the 1955 Maid of Cot-
ton will be found on a college cam-
pus in one of the 18 cotton states.

Any girt born in a cotton-produc-
ing state who is between the ages
of 19-25, has never been married,
and is at least-5 feet 5 inches tall
is eligible to become Maid of Cot-
ton. Entry forms are available from
the National Cotton Council, P. 0.
Box 18, Memphis, Tenn.

Entry forms must be completed
and returned to the Cotton Coun-
cil's contest headquarters post-
marked no later than midnight, De-
cember 1. Two photographs must
accompany the completed entry
forms. One must be a head and
shoulders picture and the other a
full length view.

The Cotton Council emphasizes
that the Maid of Cotton competition
is not a beauty contest in its usual
sense, Judging is on the basis of
intelligence. personality, and poise.
as well as appearance.

From the group of entries, ap-
proximately 20 girls will be select-
ed to come to Memphis for contest
finals. The two-day contest finals
will include personal interviews,
photography. and a final appear-
ance before an audience at Ellis
Auditorium. At that time, the 1955
Maid will be announced.

The girl who is chosen 1955 Maid
of Cotton has an action-packed, six-
month adventure ahead. She will
tour some 40 major cities in the
United States, Canada, and Europe

fashions and a good will greeting
from the cotton industry. The
itinerary of the Maid will be ex-
tended in Europe next year, and
it also will include the Pacific
Northwestern states and Vancouv-
er, B.C., for the first times.

As official envoy from the land
of cotton, the Maid will appear as
featured model in all-cotton fashion
shows in each city she visits. She
will present a good will message to
mayors, governors, city and civic
leaders at each tour stop.

Throughout her whirlwind trav-
els, the young cotton emissary is
constantly in the spotlight. Her ac-
tivities are widely featured by ra-
dio, television, newspapers, and
magazines.

At the beginning of her cotton
tour, the Maid of Cotton will go to
New York to spend the month of
January. There she will be com-
pletely outfitted in a fashionable
year-round cotton wardrobe. Best-
known designers in the United
States will create smart cottons for
every occasion and for every sea-
son for the Maid to wear on her
tour. The wardrobe will show latest
developments in cotton fashion fab-
rics and will illustrate the season's
pace-setting fashion trends. Euro-
pean designers will add cotton
fashions to the Maid's collection
during her visit abroad.

Sponsors of the Maid of Cotton
are the National Cotton Council,
the Memphis Cotton Carnival, and
the Cotton Exchanges of Memphis,
New York, and New Orleans. An of-
ficial chaperone representing the
Cotton Council will travel with her.

Texas Western College supplied
the cotton industry’s 1954 Maid.
She was blue-eyed, 20-year-old Bev-
erly Pack of El Paso, an outstand-
ing junior student at the Texas
college. Beverly has returned to

school this fall to complete work

to carry news of American cotton|on her degree.

STUDY SEEKS TO RENEW CLOSER BONDS
BETWEEN COLLEGE STUDENTS, FACULTY

Hartford, Conn.—(LP.)—Ameri-
can colleges and universities which
believe that the best teaching is
done in the tradition of “a teach-
er on one end of a log and the stu-
dent on the other” are concerned
that growing student personnel ser-
vices are cutting a notch in the log
between student and teacher.

Studies on how to utilize person-
nel specialists in college without
interrupting the close student-
teacher relationship are being made
by the Commission on Student Per-
sonnel of the American Council on
Education, headed by Dr. Albert C.
Jacobs, , president of Trinity Col-
lege. .

A major concern of the commis-
sioner Dr. Jacobs reports. is that on
many campuses student personnel
work “is regarded by both students
and faculty as a separate service or
administrative activity, an ‘em-
pire’ apart from the rest of the
institution, failing to be understood
as fundamental in the total educa-
tional process. The concern of the
commission has been of eliciting
greater recognition of the oppor-
tunity which the teacher has in
working with students, not one of
seeking to circumscribe or diminish
the opportuniy of the student per-
sonnel specialist.”

In seeking “the impediments
which prevent the teacher from
making the student the central fo-
cus of teaching,” Dr. Jacobs noted
“the continuing expansion of knowl-
edge and the difficulty of the teach-
er informing himself in his own
and other fields; the pressure of
individual research; the interest of
the teacher himself, recognizing
that many teachers are interested
only in research, shutting out en-
tirely the welfare of their students;
that this interest may be due to
practical necessity because of in-
stitutional policy of ‘up or out,’
‘publish or perish;’ a special ignor-
ance on the part of many teachers
as to what students really are like
and what are their major prob-
lems.”

He also stressed as obstacles the

competing demands for the teach-
er's time — faculty committee ser-
vice, outside employment, partici-
pation in student affairs, and com-
petition in the fields of science and
government; a difference in basic
philosophy, some staff members not
agreeing with the premise that stu-
dents are the primary business of
a college or university.

The pressures of greater number
of college students forecast for the
next decade may mean even less
faculty member time available per
student, Dr. Jacobs warned. The
Commission, he said, has agreed
that it is more important to stim-
ulate reappraisal of the integration
of student testing and counseling
through informal discussion than
to-“sell” a particular program.

Law Admission Test
Announced For 54-55

Princeton, N. J. — The Law
Schoo] Admission Test required of
applicants for admission to a num-
ber of leading American law
achools, will be given at more than
100 centers throughout the United
States on the mornings of Novem-
ber 13, 1954, February 19, April 23.
and August 6, 1955. During 1983-
54 some 8200 applicants took this
test, and their scores were sent to
over 100 law schools. °

A candidate must make separate
application for admission to each
law school of his choice and should
inquire of each whether it wishes
him to take the Law School Admis-
sion Test and when. Since many
law schools select their freshman
classes in the spring preceding
their entrance, candidates for ad-
mission to next year’s classes are
dvised ordinarily to take either the
November or the February test, if
possible.

The Law School Admission Test,
prepared and administered by Edu-
cational Testing Service, features
objective questions measuring ver-
bal aptitudes and reasoning ability
rather than acquired information.
It cannot be “crammed” for. Sam-
ple questions and information re-
garding registration for and admin-
istration of the test are given in a
Bulletin of Information.

Bulletins and applications for the
test should be obtained four to six
weeks in advance of the desired
testing date from Law School Ad-
mission Test, Educational Testing

THE DAVIDSONIAN

3-Year Arts Program

New York, N. Y., @P.) — A
pioneer in liberal arts education
since 1919 through the develop-
ment of the nationally-known
courses in Contemporary Civili-
zation and the Humanities, Colum-
bia College, the liberal arts un-
dergraduate school for men at
Columbia University, is now plan-
ning to eliminate the fifty-year-old
“professional option” program for
all except engineering students.

At the same time all students
will be required to include an area
of concentration in their program
which will require at least 24 points
of study in some one department.
These thorough-going changes,
which are expected to increase sub-
stantially the liberal arts content
of the last two years, will become
effective this month for the Class
of 1958 and those following, accord-
ing to Dr. Lawrence H. Chamber.
lain, dean of the College.

The reorganization of the U

College has been the subject of
extensive faculty and student dis-
cussion since the end of World
War II, particularly as to profes-
sional option. This plan permitted
College seniors to spend their last
undergraduate year as a graduate
student in the University’s profes-
sional schools of medicine, dentis-
try, law, engineering and architec-
ture.

It was originally instituted to in-
sure that preprofessional students
would have a minimum of three
years of liberal arts education but,
as most graduate schools began to
require a baccalaureate degree for
admission, its purpose became lost.

In recent years, the professional
option plan, according to Dean
Chamberlain, has actually served
the direct opposite ‘of its original
function by eliminating one year
of liberal arts education for the
preprofessional student. At the
same time the rigors of specialized
professional study, sometimes far
distant from the College campus,
denied to the professional option
student the time and opportunity to
maintain his extracurricular activi-
ties during the important senior
year.

Discussing the eld Upper College
program, Dean Chamberlain cited
the fact that in the past a student
could be graduated from the Col-
lege with a minimal number of
courses in any one department.
Because of the necessarily intro-
ductory nature of such courses, a
student could complete his college
program with a cursory knowledge
of many disciplines, but without
any concrete and |‘ comprehensive
understanding of one particular
field.

He also pointed out that under |
the old plan many of the seminars |
were of an advanced nature, requir. :
ing several courses in preparation,
as well as being elective. These two
factors worked to prevent numer-
out Upper College students. from
choosing or being eligible for sem-
inar courses, thus missing suffi-
cient opportunity to exercise the |
independent judgment and _plan-
hing which the Dean felt must be,
an integral part of a liberal arts
education. |

Internationalists To
Convene Tuesday At 4

The first meeting of the Inter-
national Relations Club will be held
Tuesday afternoon at 4 p.m. in the
Green Room of the College Union.
All freshmen who are interested
as well as interested upperclassmen
and the old members are especially
urged to be there for this import-
ant planning meeting for the year’s
activities.

There are many organizations
and clubs on the campus, but this
is the only one which gives the
student a direct chance to get out
of the cloister which is Davidson
life to look at the world beyond.
Last year there were many inter-
esting programs and discussions
centering on understanding inter-
national affairs and contemporary
problems including panels on “Eu-
ropean Attitude Toward the United
States” and “Christian Morality
and Power Politics.”

The club will be meeting once
a month as usual, and all students
are always welcome. This year the
officers will be Roy Davis, Pres-
ident; Kiki Lewis, Vice-President;
and Gilbert Gragg, Secretary.

Grad Schools, Firms
Must Fight It Out
For Senior Classes

Chicago, 111.—(.P.) — Opportuni-
ties for gradyate study in science
and engineering are greater than
ever before, but so are the tempta-
tions that cause college students
to end their formal schooling at
the bachelor’s degree level. The re-
port comes from Dr. Marion H.
Groves, assistant dean of the grad-
uate school at Ilinois Institute of
Technology, who attributed both in-
creases to the critical shortage of
scientists and engineers.

Dr. Groves said educational in-
stitutions are offering more fel-
lowships and assistantships to in-
duce outstanding students to work
towards master and/or doctor's de-
grees.. He pointed out that the na-
tional government, private indus-
try, research organizations, and pro-
fessional and scientific groups are
sponsoring an increasing number
of fellowships for graduate study.

The number of graduate fellow-
ships at IMinois Tech has grown
from 10 to more than 50 during the
last five years. Dr. Groves reveal-
ed. The value of these grants has
increased greatly during this per-
iod, he added. “It appears that all
fellowships for 1954-55 will award
stipends of $2,000 or more,” he ex-
plained, comparing the figure to
the $1,400 average fivé years ago.
He said that fellowships allowing
full concentration on the academ-
ic program last year ranged from
$1,750 to $2,150. with an average
stipend. including tuition, of $1,-
990.

Dr. Groves also offered some
striking figures showing how the
value of assistantships has increas-
ed during the past 10 years—more
than doubled, in fact. The assistant-
ships will provide $1,750 during the
1954-55 academic year, compared to
$825 a decade. ago. Five years ago
the figure was $1,275.

He pointed out that the tempta-
tions to forego further study for
an immediate position in industry
have never been so great as they
are at the present. Each graduating
class, Dr. Groves explained, is con-
fronted by the numerous represen-
tatives of companies who come to

Wide CulfureRange |MEXICAN STUDY
A Student Must’ Now| AWARDS AVAILABLE

St. Louls, Mo.—(LP.)—A liberal
education must include a knowl-
edge of several fields of religion,
philosophy, history, the social
sciences and physical science, de-
clares The Reverend Maurice B.
McNamee, S. J., associate profes-
sor of English at the St. Louis Uni-
versity.

“It is becoming more and more
apparent among educators that dif-
ferentiation in the curriculum and
in the course content for various
levels of students is absolutely
necessary, if we are to salvage the
notion of a liberal education from
our modern ‘educational waste-
lands.’ St. Louis University has be-
gun some significant experiments
in this area of differentiation.
Three years ago she introduced a
program of general studies for
weaker students devised to give
them some significant breadth of
intellectual experience but tailored
to their capacities.”

Father McNamee pointed out
that because of the mass produc-
tion we have in this country, the
one who is apt to suffer most is
the genuinely superior student. Be-
cause of the huge numbers in ¢ol-
lege today, the curriculum and
teaching methods are leveled down
to the average student and the real-
ly superior student is not apt to
find a real challenge to his intel-
ligence.
