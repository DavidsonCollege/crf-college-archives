Playing for the love

Or is it paying for the love?

Now I know the going trend
for Opinions article lately has been
to rip on Davidson, but I’m mov-
ing on. It’s too cold out for golfing
on Covington anymore, so it really
does not matter what shape it’s in.
No, the cold is here and it’s time to
sit inside on the couch and watch
sports. Here is where my troubles
lie. When I was a young lad, it
used to be that Sundays were filled
with the enjoyment of watching
the great sports heroes of the NFL
or NBA. I looked up to these
fantastic athletes with great admi-
ration, dreaming of one day be-
coming a Cleveland Brown or
Philadelphia 76er. But now pro-
fessional sports have fallen apart.
Money rules and the fans lose.

First of all, pro sports fran-
chises have lost all attachment to
theirhostcities. Being from Cleve-

land (and proud of it), I’m mad as
hell about the Browns moving to
Baltimore. When I think of pro

fans to follow the home team be-
cause the home team only sticks
around for a few years before mov-

football fans at their best, thinkof ing on to another city. Am I sup-

Cleveland and

my neck and let out with, “Go

Panthers, Wahoo!”

It’s not only the owners that
are being greedy. The players are
just as guilty.

Cleveland’s not the only city that
is losing its teams because of greedy
owners. Poor Houston is losing
the Astros and Oilers in the same
year. Itis becoming impossible for

posed to be a Baltimore Browns
fan? I don’t like Baltimore, they
stole my football team. I can’t root
for them. I guess my only choice is
to let a little extra sun beat down on

- Mourning is
the perfect example. The city of
Charlotte loved Zo. His ugly mug
was painted in downtownasaform
of respect and gratitude towards
the good he does as a player and

member of the community. But he
simply cast aside any feelings of
devotion towards Charlotte, the
Hornets, and his teammates in or-
der to make more money. Let’s be
realistic, when your making eighty
million don’t you think you could
pass ona few extra million in order
to stay in a town and help an orga-
nization which has placed its fu-
ture on your back. Zo was sup-
posed to be the future of the Hor-
nets—now I think we should just
paint over his face with a huge
dollar sign. ‘

Well, that’s about it. Just had’
to vent a little frustration with the
whole pro sports scene. I guess
this is just another reason to appre-
ciate Davidson sports. So go out
there and support the Wildcats be-
cause they play for the love of the
game.

The
Importance

of
expression

I am writing this article in re-
sponse to Dewey N. Ervin, Jr.’s
letter to the editor last week. In his
letter, Mr. Ervin expressed his dis-
content with many of the articles in
The Davidsonian, particularly in
the Opinions section. While I am
genuinely sorry that he is offended
by some of the “unnecessary exple-
tives,” I feel he is promoting some-
thing that contradicts the value of
education. Although I think the
news and information articles of
the paper should be journalistic
and proper in both content and
form, I feel that the Opinions sec-
tion should be reserved for just
that, opinions.

To write an opinion article for
the Davidsonian, a paper read by
almost all students, faculty, and
administrators, is difficult because
of the possible scrutiny the author
could receive. When one chooses
to publicly express their feelings
about an issue, he or she is ex-
tremely vulnerable to criticism,
resentment, and stereotypes. But
what kind of academic atmosphere
would we be living in if we had to
always say the “proper” thing or
pretend to feel the way others feel?
Isn’t a large part of college finding
yourself and understanding your
feelings? If itis, then one needs to
have a forum in which he or she is
allowed the freedom of expression
without resorting to bombastic lan-
guage in order not to offend any-
one and sound more intelligent.
While I commend Mr. Ervin for
expressing his own opinion on the
subject, I also commend all of the
writers of opinion articles for ex-
pressing theirs.

Sunday evening ritual

Well, here I am again, 5:30
p-m., Sunday, a gun to my head.
Advice for all you underclassmen:
don’t live with the editor of the
Opinions section of The
Davidsonian (the rest of this sen-
tence has been edited). Either way,
I press on, rack my brain, and
present to you the fragmented
thoughts which sprinkle from my
ears.
I saw Goldeneye on Saturday.
Matinee is definitely the way to go.
I just don’t understand why .007
doesn’t die so they can stop hitting
us over the head with the same
movie-in-a-can. If you’ve ever
seen aJamesBond movie then you
know what Goldeneye is like. Save
your money. Without Roger Moore

or Sean Connery there is no James ©

Bond. You wanted them to get the
girl, not this new guy. I don’t
know—the movie was ok.

Eating Houses. Every girlI’ ve
talked to about the female organi-
zations on Patterson Court is less

than satisfied. The fault of the
eating houses lies in the lack of
bonds which are formed. Fraterni-
ties go through a rigorous bond-
forming period called pledging.
Eight weeks of rolling around,
waking up early, studying together,
fun with 20 (or 10) other guys that
go on to become some of your
closest buds—not to mention the
friendships which form between
the freshmen (or sophomores) and
upperclassmen who show them the
ropes. The women have no such
time. In the outsider/male per-
spective I see no difference be-
tween an eating house and the Com-
mons. Why don’t we divide Com-
mons into three different sections
and all the girls can go there and eat
(with an occasional dance or two).

My point is that as
freshwomen, girls choose where
to be a member, and they base this
choosing on where their friends
are going, so no new bonds are
ever formed; the old bonds just get

stronger until your a senior, sick of
your friends, and have no one else
to play with. I may be wrong. Just
a thought.

And what’s the story with
these inspections of the senior
apartments. I suppose they are sort
of good because they force us to
clean at least once a year, but they
are really annoying. It’s sort of
like cutting off the beer at mid-
night during court parties, yet an-
other instance of Big Brother look-
ing over our shoulders. Some-
times I think they make these rules
just to get under our skin. I don’t
see how RLO can even find the
time to inspect all the apartments
considering they can’t find the time
to do any maintenance work on
them. If you’ ve ever put in a work
order you’ ll understand. Prompt-
ness is certainly not their thing.

My apartment failed because
we had a few pieces of wood lying
on our porch. Not really a health
hazard, but I guess they are a bit

unsightly. Actually, the only rea-
son the wood still occupies half
our porch is because we one day
plan to build an entertainment cen-
ter. Of course, the one offered to us
for free by a local couple wasn't
good enough. No, my roommate,
construction man, felt building our
own would be so much more satis-
fying. Unfortunately we all lost
the zeal for woodwork about three
minutes after we carted all the wood —
to our apartment. So there it stays.
Last night I came hope to find a
sapling sitting outside the front
window. I guess the wood was
getting lonely and decided to mul-
tiply. Strange but true.

Sorry for another
[expletive edited] article. If you’re
bored, want to procrastinate, have
a word processor you haven’t used
in a while, think you’re funny, or
can type/write, please contact el
Jéfe at-2148 so I don’t have to
subject you to another piece of
junk like this. Thanks.
