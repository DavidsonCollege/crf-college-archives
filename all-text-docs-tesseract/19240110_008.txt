BILLY SUNDAY WILL SPEAK

(Continued from page 1)

Great enthusiasm is being manifested in his
sermons. He puts every ounce of energy
he has into them, combining a tongue of
Demosthenes, the reasoning of a Webster,
and the endurance of an Olympian athlete.
His zeal, however, does not detract from his
forcefulness.

Mr. Sunday has been offered a million dol-
lars annually as a movie actor and several
thousand daily as a chautauqua lecturer. He
is a man of recognized powers, who is de-
voting them to a worthy cause. It is in-
teresting to note that he began his career in
an orphans’ home.
