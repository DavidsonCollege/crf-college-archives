Musical cast finds success, hard work

By JOHN WOOD
Staff Writer

The glitter, the laughs, the fun
and the fantasy of last weeks
‘Anything Goes’’ performances
are over.

The performances, which had
Davidson College people, the
Davidson community and
others enthralled, laughing and
tapping their way out of the
theater, ended with a climae-
tical performance for the cast
Saturday evening. The set was
dismantled by 2:00 a.m. Sun-
day.

“Tt’s best that way (taking the
set down that night)...there is
no use for it any more,’ Set
Designer Joseph Gardner
commented, ‘‘you sort of get
used to it.’’ He had spent over a
month designing the complex
and movable set with rotating
rooms. Gardner also was
Costume Designer.

Several of the veteren actors
and actresses commented that
it was important to forget the
fantasy and play; remembering
it as a chapter in their lives and
. going on to other activities.

Monday, the set was gone and
only a few remnants of the stage
decor were noticed back stage.
Janitors were sweeping the
aisle ways in preparation. for a
Tuesday musical performance.

Aside from the consumate
and complex set, the casting
and direction of the musical was
a demanding job in itself.

formances. The dancers, who
had long, concentrated
rehearsals were affected
considerably. Most had no prior
experiences dancing.

Many of the students involved
have had some academic
problems because of the time
demand of the play.

Cast selection

_ Auditioning began, unusually,

prior to spring term at the end
of winter term. 78 persons
applied for parts in the cast and
in a three part--three sitting
weeding process the final cast
of 32 members was selected.

There were approximatly 100
persons involved in the whole
production.

The three parts included
reading on stage for Barber,
singing for the play’s Musical
Director Michael Pittard and
dancing under the scrutiny of
Choreographer Linda Mallonee
and Musical -Stager Nancy
Gardner. The latter judging a
person’s ability to learn a dance
step.

The schedule for the play
started after spring break with
reading through the play, then
the cast began mastering their
movements on stage and finally
the dress rehearsals. All the
while the ‘“‘acting’’ segment is
working, Pittard, Mallonee and
Gardner ‘were working in-
dividually with the singing and
dance numbers.

Ellen Schlaefer who played
Mrs. Harcourt, Steve Pharr
who played Bifly Crocker and
Alison Peeler who played
Virtue, one of the Angels, had
either leg or foot problems

- during rehearsals. This made

all the more difficult.

Back stage during the per-
formances, what with stage
crew and make-up people, the
scene was often hectic. Many
costume and footwear changes
on the part of the major roles
including the sailors had to be
made with the stage crew
“staying way out of the way,’”
according to one of the crew
members.

While designing the set
Gardner had to consider con-
stantly the limited space on the
stage in light of a relatively
large cast.

The cast would show up by
6:30 for an 8:15 showing in order
to be made-up in the small
make-up room. This was partly
due to necessity and partly due
to the cast not wanting to be
harried before show time,
according to Hal McCoy who is
now also known as Moonface
Martin public enemy no. 13.

Barber is known by the cast
as\not only an excellent and
personable director but an
educational one as well. He
gave the responsibility of

‘developing the role to the given

cast member, according to
Reno Sweeney’s role player
Patricia Arnold, Pharr and
McCoy. Alterations, corrections
and changes were latter made
in colaboration with him. This
gives the cast member an op-
portunity to struggle with her--
his part and hopefully learn a
little about themselves as well
as the character. One of Bar-
ber’s commitments in drama is
its educational rewards for the
cast, crew and audience.
Some of the cast »members
developed their characters by
by adding what are known as
bits or business, little actions
that are not neccessarily called
for in the script but add to the
role, as late as the opening
night. “This is what we were
hoping for,’’ Gardner said.
‘We have had an ambitious

year,” he asserted concerning
the three major productions this
year. They all involved a large
cast and a great deal of time
and commitment on the part of
the students.

Last musical

The last musical the depart-
ment produced was “Oh What A
Lovely War” written by a
British acting ensemble. The
Davidson production was in
1969. -°

Both Gardner and Barber
expressed skepticism about
another musical for next year.
The work and demands on all
involved would be too great for
a musical two years in a row.

This rendition of ‘Anything
Goes’’ was a re-hash of the

original production of 1934. At
that time the format, which
included a shipwreck, had to be
changed due to the sinking of a
real ocean liner. It was then
altered to generally the same
plot as the one just performed.

In 1962, a group of people
wanting to make the epitome of
the Cole Porter musical, added
a number of his songs, pulled a
few, and changed the script to
incorporate the new Porter hits.

The play has ended. Those
who worked long and hard to
pull off a tight and professional
show now move on to other
shows and projects and we have
Cole Porter’s ‘“‘Anything Goes’’
to hum for who knows how long.

“Shows have to end,”’ con-
cluded McCoy.
