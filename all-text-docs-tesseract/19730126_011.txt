The Cleveland Indians, one of
the best conglomerates of
freaks ever seen on the courts
are definitely a power to be
reckoned with as they are also
3-0 in League A's division 1.

The remnants of defending
champion Watts I plus Dennis
Cholak and Jack Willits make a
deep, strong team that looks to
be the best of a balanced tow
leagues. So far they have
beaten W1-A 98-51, the KAs 63-33
and crushed the Crankateers 79-
39.

The darkhorse in this division
of League A is definitely

Bill Garrett, who thus became
Davidson's only victor in. the

able to get one six point pin and
one four point major decision.
Davidson could only get three

point decisions other than the

Rob Benton said that
“Washington and Lee wrestled
very defensively.) which
makes it difficult to turn a man
onto his back.

Lee Monday 24-14.

Then on Sunday at full
strength they sent the WI1-A
wimps back to the dorms at #1-
37. On Tuesday they got their
third win as they rebeled against
the KAs to look away in a 61-
43 victory.

In Division 2 of League A the
Delts who are sporting five
teams (jock fraternity?), have
areal fine one in PDT 1.

Delt #1 is 3-0 and they have
taken an average victory
margin of 20 points in their
three wins. Last Tuesday their
balanced attack shut "US" up
47-34. Then on Sunday they
crushed Loo Kat Mee 60-36 and
finished up Wednesday by
slugging it out with PAX #1
before running away at 61-46.

The Delts don't give many
second shots as their tough 2-1-2
zone D has only given up 38.7
pts./game.

The SPEs with one of the
most organized and determined
teams in the league are also 3-0
as they look to one of the top
players in IMAC ball, John
**Duke™ Sims.

Sims is the leading scorer in
the both leagues with a 22.5
average as he has led the SPEs
to wins over Loo Kat Mee. PAX'
A. and US. all victories coming
by about 20 point margins

Ah ves. there is also the
loosest team in the world in this
division, the PKAs #1. Coach
Jim “Low-low’ Lowry and his
detensive coordinator Tommy
“the beached whale’ Verlin

have piloted this team of frater-
nity cast-offs to a perfect 3-0
slate.

The PKAs wheezed past the
Old Men, cruised by Cosbis
Cosmos, and then ripped Deals.
Coach Lowry, when asked why
he has turned so many big leads
in the squeeker victories, said
that, ‘everybody gets a chance
to play on my team.”’

This is evidenced by the fact
that nine men have scored in
each of the PKA #1 3 wins.

Due to space and the amount
of scores that need to be report-
ed, League B will be covered in
detail next week.

However, now, for the first
time in DAVIDSONIAN history
are the top 10 scores in League
A. compiled by the C.A. and
Buck's Sports Bureau.

John “Duke” Sims of the
world reknowned SPEs leads
the rest of the bodies with a 22.5
average.

Marty Williamson is in no. 2
with the Gamms at 21.0/game.

Next, holding at 3. is Sam Up-
church from US at 20.7.

Mark Rodgeman is 4th at 20
pts. for the tribe from
Cleveland.
