Besides the 400 yard free

meet, Voight also set a new 50
yard freestyle mark. For the
year Voight remains undefeated
in all the races he has entered.

Mark Tommerdahl set a new
school record in the 1000 meter
freestyle, bringing to four the
total of school records. set this
year. This high total of records
for this early in the season is
indicative of the team’s hard
work throughout the fall term.

Coach Pat Miller was deligh-
ted with the victory and re-
marked, ‘‘I knew we had a
chance to beat UNC-W, but I
never imagined a victory by this
type of margin. I thought that
we might win by a few points at
the most.”
