U.S. News ranks Davidson 5th in value, 12th in financial aid |

By Mary Clare Jalonick

Just when you thought it was
over, U.S. News and World Report
has come out with another college
ranking for Davidson. Ina follow-
up issue to the annual “Best Col-
leges” list, the magazine has ranked
universities and liberal arts col-
leges according to value and “‘dis-
counted value.”

Davidson was ranked Sth in
the liberal arts category for value,
aranking that is figured by quality
of the school as compared to price.
The number is based on “sticker
price” —tuition plus room, board,
and fees.

Davidson was ranked 1 2th for
“discounted value,” a ranking that
U.S. News urges readers to look at
a little more closely. This ranking
is figured by subtracting an aver-

age of need-based grants from the
sticker price.

Director of College Relations
Jerry Stockdale explains his inter-
pretation of the rankings: “We
don’t have the financial aid re-
sources available that other col-
leges do. Our aid is not strong. We

The 1994 “sticker price” is

$22,534.

However, some schools have
no merit scholarships, while
Davidson awards them to 20% of
students. Davidson’ s average merit
award is $3,435.

Kelton has confidence in

that ranked highest while spending
the least amount of money.

rankings at all.” ee

Kelton is not concerned. “If
you look at the list, there are not
many on there with really high
rankings in the other categories.

Freshmen disappointed
with homecoming

By Meg Wolff

With first. night down and
Homecoming in the not-too-dis-
tant past, rumor has it that the num-
ber of freshmen who received in-
vitations to fraternities this year’s
homecoming parties was signifi-
cantly less than in yéars past.

While many freshmen, includ-
ing Jonathan Frost “had a great
time — I think everybody really
liked it,” many people say that as
many as 50% of the freshmen did
not get invited to a house. KA
social chair Howdie Coonley ex-
plains that most houses, in order to
generate a list of people to invite to
homecoming, have the brothers list
freshmen that they have met. Those
freshmen then almost all receive
invitations to the house function,

Patterson Court Council Presi-
dent Josh Worsham doesn’t think
anything was different this year:
“Homecoming is primarily a rush
function - we (Patterson Court

~ Council) pretty much leave itupto

the houses.” Worsham suggésts
that the early homecoming date
may be at fault: “Maybe because
homecoming was so early this year
problems came up - guys didn’t
really get a chance to get involved
inahouse.” Coonley agrees: “Since
Homecoming was so close to first
night down, we just didn’t get a
chance to meet a lot of the fresh-
men.”

Sig Ep social chair Chris Mann
remarks: “It seems all the houses
try and invite as many freshman as
possible - it was not meant to be an
exclusive thing, especially this year
when there was so little time to
meet freshmen.”

PCC president Worsham
stresses that there is plenty of time
left for freshmen to become in-
volved in a house: “Fraternity rush
goes until November, so everyone
should have a chance to get to
know the house of their choice.”

Davidson’s standings. “Our tu-
ition is low for the quality we have.”
Efficiency

U.S. News also ranked college
efficiency. The rankings were
based on the school’s overall score
divided by the amount that they
spent per student, or the colleges

means more pro-
grams and activities and smaller
classes. I’m not convinced that
spending less money per student is
good.”
Moving in the Right Direction
Stockdale says that “as money
comes in, we should improve our
position.” With the Campaign for

Davidson, the new Belk scholar-
ships, and individual donors in-
creasing our resources each year,
Davidson is becoming more com-
petitive within the ranks of finan-
cial aid.

Jamie May, Director of De-
velopment, says that the Campaign
for Davidson has already contrib-
uted $38 million for need-based
and merit scholarships. The five-
year campaign, begun in 1989, has
almost reached its goal of $150
million.

May says that Davidson's fi-
nancial giving ability will always
be improving. “Without a doubt
the college will continue to em-
phasize money for scholarships.
But our needs are so great that I
would never foresee a time when
we wouldn’t need more grants.”

The Women’s Issues Committee is experincing record involvement during its regular
meetings. Chair of the committee senior Sarah Orsbon, along with her committe, has
planned a variety of activities including a weeken d of backpacking with women professors
and evenings of dinner and discussion with faculty.

awareness to international con-
cerns.”
What are some of Perry’s
greatest contributions to
_ Davidson?

Ortmayer feels that Perry’s
personal contacts have been in-
valuable to the school in many
ways, but especially in the devel-
opment of the Davidson in Wash-
ington program. “He has an amaz-
ing range of contacts—from people
_ who know him to those who actu-

_ ally worked under him. He has
been the key to not only bringing
influential speakers to Davidson
but to broadening the Davidson’s
program in Washington, D.C.”

How do students feel about
Perry’s contributions and
retirement?

Perry leaves some big shoes
to fill in the eyes of many students
at Davidson. _ Eric Rosenbach,
President of the SGA, says, “Perry
is the ideal role model—certainly
my mentor while I’ve been at
Davidson. If my life turns out to be
as accomplished and fulfilling as
his, that would be all I could hope

”

for.

Rosenbach believes the high-
lights of Perry’s work here include
his success in actually getting stu-
dents interactively involved in for-
eign politics, especially through
the activities of SAC. “Davidson
is one of the very few colleges in
the nation that has a program such
as Dean Rusk to enhance interna-
tional itudies, and the fact that it is
here and has been so successful is
due to Perry.”

Senior John Murchison says,
“In his class, Perry’s outside per-
spective—the fact that he has actu-
ally lived and done what he is
teaching about—is critical for stu-
dents.” Rosenbach agrees: “He
takes his experience into the class-
room and provides an invaluable
perspective into foreign politics—
one that an average professor sim-
ply cannot offer.” Sometimes
coined “Storytime with Jack,” his
lectures are entertaining and infor-
mative because “any lecture has a
story to accompany it, whether it
be of people he has met or experi-
ences he has had,” says sophomore
Michael Farley.

On a personal level, Perry is

known for always being readily
available to students. Whether to
discuss class topics, prospects for
international studies, or the
weather, “Perry’s door is always
open, and he is willing to discuss
anything,” says Farley.
What will Perry do following
his retirement?

Though -he may be retiring,
Perry does not intend to vanish
from the Davidson community. He
and his wife will probably take a
little time off to travel—possibly
for a year—and then return to
Davidson. ee,

Despite the loss of Perry as
director of the Dean Rusk Pro-
gram, his service to Davidson will
not be forgotten. When thinking of
Perry, Farley says “only one thing
comes to mind. Last summer some-
one tell me, ‘The greatest use of
life is to spend it for something that
will outlast it.’ While his teaching
brings to class his unparalleled
experience and dedicated service,
his actual service to people as am-
bassador, professor, and friend ful-
fills this creed and affords an ex-
ample we can all look to with ap-
preciation and awe.”
