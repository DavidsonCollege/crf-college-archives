ligion. We blame our lack of interest in
our religious doctrine on the fact that Christ
lived so long ago, and that we cannot know
Him as He lived then. “But,” said Mr.
Chalmers, “this is actually the reason why
we should know Christ better.” He went
on to show that we should understand Christ
better now than His first disciples did, be-
cause we know more about him. He seems
real to us._Mr. Chalmers quoted statements
about George Washington and Woodrow
Wilson, made in their own time, which we
now know to be utterly untrue. This shows
that it takes centuries to get a true opinion.
The actual cause of our laxness in matters
of religion, as he sees it, is a lack of atten-
tion. We are always doing something else.
We have no place for Christ. He is lost in
the crowd.

Reverend Chalmers brought a new under-
standing with his message Monday morning.
It was enjoyed:and appreciated by all that
heard it.

is a vice-president. of-the-Y, is a member of
the Reporters’ Club, was president of the
Sophomore class last year and a member of
the Beaver Club. °

All are members of the Junior class.

These four men were pledged at a meet-
ing of the chapter held Monday, November
7, and will be initiated about two weeks
hence.

HOMECOMING CELEBRATION
HELD LAST WEEK-END

(Continued from page 1)
when Carolina defeated Davidson, 12 to 0.

On Saturday night the Pan-Hellenic Coun-
cil again sponsored a dance. This time it
was an informal dance in the Hotel Char-
lotte, with Reeves Pope and His Southern-
aires furnishing the music. A capacity crowd
attended,- with all men who played against
€arotina~being admitted as guests of the
Pan-Hellenic_Council.

All fraternities gave house parties this
week-end, and a number of charming girls
were here, so that the old grads saw that
the younger generation is just as pretty as
those who came before it.

Taking it all in all, and despite the loss
of the game, Homecoming was a big suc-
cess, and next year the celebration will still
go on, and Duke will furnish the opposition
for the annual Homecoming game.

BROWN WINS SECOND

HONORS IN SYMPOSIUM

(Continued from page 1)

having served on the Freshman debating
team last yedr and qualified for the varsity
team this year, “Skip” Brown is president of
the Sophomore class, a member of the
Beaver Club, of the Forensic Council, and
of Beta Theta Pi social fraternity. His home
is in Rivers Edge, N. J.

While at Athens he arranged debates with
the University of Georgia and Rollins Col-
lege. These debates will be held by the
varsity team on its regular southern trip.
first of these debates will mark the

opening of forensic relations between Geor-
gia University and Davidson. The team is
deemed especially fortunate to have secured
a debate with Rollins. This Florida college,
noted for. its liberal ideas, is said to have
one of the finest debating teams in the South
and East. Included on the Rollins schedule
is a debate at Dublin, Ireland, and one -with
Oxford University to be broadcast over
WEAF some time this winter.

CAROLINA DOWNS
DAVIDSON 12-TO-0

(Continued from page 1)
started in an attempt to score. Led by Buck
Mills, ably assisted by Fred Fleagle, George
Wingfield, and Johnny Mackorell, the ’Cats
threw a scare into the leading Tar Heels.
Magckorell got around left end for ten yards
and a first down, and Mills duplicated his
feat. Then Mills whipped a 26-yard pass to
Morris, who was downed on Carolina’s 22-
yard marker. After tivo passes had been
grounded, Mackorell shot one to Morgan,

which was good for 14 yards, but it missed
a first down and'the ball went over. Caro-
lina then took the ball and advanced stead-
ily, being deep in Davidson territory as the
game ended.

A man without passion is only a latent
force, only a possibility, like a stone waiting
for the blow from the iron to give forth
sparks.—Henri-Frederic Amiel.
