Spencer Is Quoted in
Times’ Word Puzzle

Friends of Dr. S. R. Spencer
have. learned that The New York
Times Magazine (Sunday edition)
of July 31, 1955, carried a quota-
tion from his recently published
biography ‘of Booker T. Washing.
ton.

Puzzle fans have long been
familiar with the Kingsley
“Double-Crostics” that have fea.
tured The Saturday Review of
Literature and the magazine sec-
tion of the Sunday Times. The
typical puzzle consists of two
parts: first are the definitions of
key words listed vertically:
second are the words forming a
quotation.

On page 42 of the issue men-
tioned, the complete puzzle reads,
‘His stepfather agreed that
Booker might attend school only
1f he would put in five hours at
the salt mine between four in the
morning and nine, and two hours
after school in the afternoon. This
hard bargain Booker accepted joy-
fully.” The initial letters of the
key words read. “S. R Spencer,
Je., Booker TJ. Washington.”
