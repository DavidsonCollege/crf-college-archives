Scott Suspects Foul Play InGovernance

To The Editor:

The adoption during the sum-
mer of the Academic and Gov-
ernance Regulations is one in-
dicator that whatever trend to-
wards more meaningful involv-
ment of students in the opera-
tions of their universities has in-
deed by-passed the trustees and
select administrators of David-
son College.

Perhaps some facuity mem-
bers should also be included as
contributors to the insensitive
document, but their involve-
ment has tended to be more in
the area of Section |, that deal-
ing strictly with academic af-
fairs, which was compiled with
some meaningful student as-
sistance.

In addition, the very nature
of academic relationships lends
greater justification to the way
in which it was passed as com-
pared to Section II, that deal-
ing with .student conduct and
courts.

I would suggest five major
reasons why the 1971 edition of
the Governance Regulations
would be viewed as a violation
of student rights and dignity
and, consequently should be
categorically rejected.

It goes without saying that
the method of adoption by-pass.
ed all legitimate avenues of
student consideration. Even
though I was aware that the
trustees were in the process of
drafting a new structure for
handling student conduct, I
doubt very seriously that there
were many other students who
were as fortunate.

My awareness came from a
tangential association with Stu-
dent Government, an impotent
body to be sure, but one which
serves as a hotbed of campus
gossip.

There was, of course, no pos-

Tl Drink To That.’

sible way for the incoming
freshmen to be aware of con-
duct changes, and no effort was
made to inform them that a
midsummer trustee meeting
might alter former statutes.

No student referendum was
held; very few meetings were
arranged and those that were
poorly publicized. Students were
given one chance to meet and
to express their sentiments with
the trustee committee consider-
ing conduct revision and even
though student attendance at
this meeting was impressive,
only thirty percent of the trus-
tees bothered to attend them-
selves.

Dr. Bevan insists that the
trustees met frequently with
one or two students to get the
student viewpoint.

Although this concession may
have appeared monumental to
the trustees, it strikes me as
somewhat akin to sending two
trucking firm executives into a
meeting with the nation’s rail-
road leaders in order to demand
adjustments in rail policy giv-
ing trucks a rate advantage.

During their mid-June meet-
ing, after all students had de-
parted for the summer, the
trustees upon the advice of Dr.
Phillips and Dr. Warner Hall
accepted the committee’s pro-
posals.

No student vote was ever tak-
en or requested. A student poll.
listing the options or requesting
reaction to the one proposal was
never circulated.

The second reason is that the
trustees never presented a writ-
ten draft of their conduct con-
siderations until after students
had left for the summer.

Student government and the
president of the student body,
made frequent requests for a
written document however ten-

tative it may have been.

The conduct committee of the
trusfees refused to do so on the
grounds that they wanted to
keep the affair as open and as
subject to change and sugges-
tion as possible.

They were afraid, so we were
told, that a written draft would
be interpreted as a premature
imposition upon the students,
and that they wanted the stu-
dents to understand that they
were still wrestling with the
problem.

Apparently, once students
could no longer be reached for
assistance, the trustees were
moved to compile a_ written
document and to accept it.
Again, all this happened after
the academic year was over.

The third reason that the reg-
ulations should be viewed with
suspicion was the way in which
it was presented in the fall of
this year.

Freshmen received their
copies as though they were the
primordial guide for forgive-
ness and salvation, as a type of

Davidson corruption of Ham-
marabbi’s code.

I was told to read the docu-
ment carefully and that if I
had any questions to refer them
to the dean of students.

Imagine that, any question I
might have regarding the codes
legitimacy was to be referred
to the very man who acts as
its enforcement arm, as its ex-
ecutive and judicial branch!
Simply incredible.

The fourth reason that calls
into serious question the code’s
acceptability is its concept and
content. Stationing relatively
highly paid informers in each
dorm, kindly called Resident
Hall Assistants, in order to ‘‘as-
sist students in getting into
their rooms in case they lock
themselves out” is something
of a misrepresentation.

I see the using of students as
plainclothesmen instead of de-
cision makers in _ particular
cases aS a cheap substitute for
meaningful participation in lo-
cal governance.

Actually the content angle is

virtually self-defeating. It’s the
overall concept behind the pro-
posal that | find most abrasive.

We are supposed to be living
in a community. That's fine.
but a community without shared
responsibilities and, yes, pow-
ers, is a farce.

If a student’s conduct within
the privacy of his room is con-
strued as the concern of the
college, and I'm not ealling that
into doubt yet, then it appears
to me that the conduct of a
professor in the shared confines
of the classroom, and the con-
duct of an admissions official
who is considering an applica-
tion recruited by a_ student
should also be the concern of
select student officials as well.

Space provided, in the next
edition of THE DAVIDSONIAN.
I will include a list of possible
alternatives. In the interim my
approach to the campus con-
duct code will continue to be.
as it has in the past: one of
malign neglect.

Intellectual Senior Recalls
Freshman Term Paper Blues

I: was about this time of the
year three years ago that I
faced what every freshman
must face sooner or later, that
is, the first paper. I remember
quite well the feeling of nausea
that swept over my body when
I got that first paper back. It
looked like the professor had
used my paper for the purpose
of cleaning his pen. Then, as
now, the letter ‘‘D” did little to

add to my general elation at
being at Davidson and even less
as far as the enlargement of
my ego was concerned.

The fact that really bothered
me after I got over the ‘‘initial”
shock from the Dog I got that
ominous fall day was the real-
ization that my paper wasn’t
worth the ink it took to put a
“D” on it. My downfall had been
the inability to communicate«
simply. It is such a lack of sim-
ple communication which causes
a great deal of frustration on
the Davidson campus.

For some unknown reason I
no longer possess that paper but
I can imagine what the first

line must have sounded like:

‘‘Due to the vicarious verisimi-
litudes of the religion of the Hit-
tites toward concrete relativ-
ism. .. .” Such a first line is
none other than a symptom of
what I shall call “cheap intel-
lectualism” which can be basic-
ally defined as the attempt to
speak on your own or some-
one else’s intellectual level.
Cheap intellectualism unfortun-
ately can be and usually is
practiced unconsciously.

Whether conscious or uncon-
scious this phenomena runs
rampant at Davidson College
and the greatest part of is not
on paper. Conversations over
trivial subjects immediately
turn the participants into tire-
less debaters whose aim is to
maul a friend intellectually and
above all else never let the
words “I”, ‘‘don’t” and ‘*‘know”
slip out jin that order.

Although cheap _intellectual-
ism is a rotten element on the
Davidson campus it is a thou-
sand times more repulsive
when carried off campus and

_ inflicted upon some unsuspect-

ing member of a less intellec-
tual environment.

For example, I remember
catching myself starting a dial-
ectic with a gas station attend-
ant who made the mistake of
commenting on the weather just
after I’d spent an hour spewing
crap on a Humanities review.

By God, I wanted to know
who the hell he thought he was
to think he had the inside line
on whether or not it would rain
that afternoon. I felt a real de-
sire to put him down.

Anyway, my point is this:
Communication is best when it
is simplest. Intelligence is dem-
onstrated through the ability to
communicate with people rather
than verbal and factual acro
batics. An_ intelligent person
does not play games when com
munication will be the loser.

Freshman Laments
Showing In Race

To the Editor:

There has been much talk as
to who really came in eighty-
first at the 36th Annual Cake
Race.

I would like to clear the lat-
ter mystery up be saying that
I was eighty-first. As for proof,
I have a whole grandstand of
masochists, my hall counselor,
Ralph Peeples, and my whole
living body.

If there is a coed on campus
who feels sorry for me, please
bake me an angel food cake
with chocolate icing. My room
is 110 Sentelle.

I am _ receiving sympathy
cards starting Monday, Septem-
ber 27.
