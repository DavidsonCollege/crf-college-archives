Three

Infirmary Weathers Student Criticism

By JOYCE STAHMANN
Staff Writer

Would you go to the in-
firmary? Many Davidson
students would stay away no
matter how sick they were,
even though each year they
pay approximately $80 in com-
pulsory infirmary fees. — .

Mrs Dorothy D. Sherrill, the
live-in nurse, says that up-
perclass students tell slan-
derous stories about the in-
firmary to scare the fresh-
men.

“Students always complain
about the infirmary and the
laundry because they know
we're the only ones who can’t
get back at them,”’ said Nurse
Sherrill

“They wouldn’t dare treat
the professors the same way.”’

Yet there are often cases of
students who will not use the
infirmary because of previous
unpleasant experience as well
as those who only go by hear-
Say.

“I wouldn’t go back there
unless it were very neces-
sary,” admitted Paul Jen-
nings, a second-year student.

One morning last year, Jen-
nings woke up with such se-
vere muscle spasms in his
that he could not move.

The infirmary was called
immediately, but it failed to
reach the doctor, who was tied
up at the Mooresville Hospital.

“I was in intense pain and
didn’t know what was wrong
with me,” said Jennings. ‘“‘The
infirmary kept saying, ’Just
bring him over, but I couldn't
even move.”

Eight hours later; contact

was made with the doctor who
sent an ambulance which did

not arrive for another four
hours.

The next morning Jennings
was -moved back to the in-

firmary where he spent two
nights. ;

“The hospital had tobea go-
between because the in-
firmary wouldn’t and couldn’t
accomodate. Its tendency is

towards efficient, impersonal .

care within a strict routine.”

Another complaint Jennings
had was that visitation
policies allowed no‘ students
but his roommate and hall
counselor to see him, a policy
which has changed at the in-
firmarythisyear. —

New visitation hours are

from 9 to 11:45 a.m., 3 to 4:45
p.m. and 6 to 9 p.m. Each
patient is allowed to see two
people at a time with each
visit lasting not more than ten
minutes.”
“Can you “visualize us
carrying out our duties as nur-
ses with seven patients and
fourteen visitors in one little
ward?’’ Sherrill asked.

“You take that and the
television going full blast. The
rules may be changed to
longer or shorter periods of
time at the discretion of the

nurses depending on how the

students act.’’

Other alterations to the in-
firmary concern ‘the star,

nurses and the Nor-
th Mecklenburg County
Medical Team from Hun-
tersville Hospital.
