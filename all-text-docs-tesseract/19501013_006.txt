Spivak's Orchestra Is Featured
In Top Hotels and Theatres

“You grow sweeter as the years

go by,” is perhaps the best way to
describe the music and the trumpet
soloings of Charlie Spivak, who
brings his top-rated orchestra to
Davidson on October 20-21.
. Always a sweet band, and winner
of the coveted Downbeat poll in
that category, Charlie plays plenty
of licks for the trained ear.

Charlie features his trumpet prac-
tically all the time which means
that when you pass by the door,
you know whose band is in the
room. He also leans towards bal-
lads—another guarantee that your
ears will enjoy a vacation.

Charlie has come a long way
since the days when he was known
as one of the greatest of the jazz
trumpeters. He had admittedly
gone commercial and if that’s bad,
then money in the bank is also bad.
He has established records at New
York’s Hotel Statler, the top hotel
dance spot and the Paramount
theatre on Broadway, mecca for
dance bands to prove he’s in the
right groove.

One of the managers at the Com-
modore Hotel in New York

summed it all up perfectly when he

said: “Spivak blows clear enough
for all to hear but people can still
carry on a conversation.”

For many years, before forming
his own dance band, Spivak was
rated as the most sought-after free
lance trumpeter in the country. He
played with radio's leading conduct-
ors on the most important programs.
Before that time, Charlie was fea-
tured with such great bands as
those conducted by the Dorsey
Brothers, Ray Noble and Ben Pol-
lack.

During his free-lance days, he
earned more each week than many
top-notch bandleaders, but decided

‘eo toss this security aside to form

his own unit. Bear in mind the fact
that though he was well established
‘as America’s finest trumpet player,
he had little reputation with the
cash customers. To them, fronting
his own band, he was a virtual new-
comer.

But Charlie went and did it, as
the saying goes, in spite of all the
difficuities and today, his is rated
as one of America’s top bands—on
records, in the Movies, at theatres
and hotels.

Rules for Thumbing . . . Look Sad,|Quality Improvement) I'7 7% v,
Lad, You'll Get There

Last week in this newspaper
there appeared an article which
criticized the freshmen for disre-
garding the hallowed Davidson
“*bumming corner’ traditions. That
article, however, touched on only
one point. There are others which,
in order to get ‘a decent ride in

this day and time, must be observed
by everyone, ffeshmen and upper-
classmen alike.

In the first place, the word “bum-
ming” should be outlawed by all
ride-beggars. Hitch-hiking, although
a double-jointed word, is much nic-
er, and besides, Davidson gentlemen
are not supposed to be bums, The
word “thumbing,” while not quite
as genteel as the other, will do if
you are on a road where nothing
but A-model fords pass by.

The second, and perhaps most
important rule is knowing how to
hold the good right hand. The
thumb should be extended grace-
fully, pointing in the direction of
the thumber’s destination. The fin-
gers should be tightly clenched, so
as to show determination. The legs
also are important; they should be
spread about 12 inches apart, so
as to have a good foundation when
the slipstream of a sleek Buick
passing at 90 miles per hits the
would-be rider.

Rule No, 3: Unless you are a
free-for-all champ,. never venture
back down the road so as to face the
oncoming cars first when anyone
else has already taken up a vigil at
a certain spot. You may go on
down the road a little, but never,
never, try to cut off another man’s
ride unless you want your head
bashed in with the stob of a CAU-
TION sign.

These are the three main rules
in the lost art of hitch-hiking, but
there are other tricks of the trade
which are helpful. For instance,
your facial expressions will often
help you to get a ride. Say Lana
Turner, or a reasoable facsimile
thereof, drives along in a beautiful
new convertible. Naturally, your
first impulse will be to whistle,
but check it, boy. Just grab your
suitcase and walk calmly out on the
road as if you'd been waiting for
her for the past 30 minutes. You'll
either have a ride and possibilities
for a fine weekend or go through
the unpleasant task of digging your.

self out of the concrete. However,
this is standard procedure, so don't
be afraid to take a chance.

For the family out for a week-
end trip, put on your best Joe Col-
lege look and perk up hopefully.

The sad, What-have-I-got-to-live-
for expression is reserved for old
ladies with Cadillacs. If you spot
one of these plums, just sit down
on your suitcase, carefully letting
the monogrammed “D” show, and
look forlorn. This look is irresis-
tible to female philanthropists and
women who are afraid they'll have
a flat tire.

And remember the cardinal rule:
Davidson students never take rides
in anything less than Cadillacs or
Rolls Royces. Any student violat-
ing this rule will be subject to most
severe disciplinary measures by the
Court of Control.

held in Gaither Hall.

Perhaps the most significant area
in which agreement was reached was
the organization about which it
was concluded decisively that the
Y. M. C. A. should be not a ser-

but rather a group which gives, and

service. Thus, around this central
idea—the Y. M. C. A. a means for
the expression of Christian Faith—
the cabinet laid the foundation for
what should prove to be an active
and serviceable year.

Half- hour devotionals were held
each morning before breakfast and
each night before retiring.

Neil Leach, president, presided
over the combined cabinet discus-
sions.

The members of the cabinet at-
tending were: Tommy Haller, Ran-
