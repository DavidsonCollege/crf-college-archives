LEST WIE FORGET.

The greatest war the world has ever
experienced is aver. “Che leading states-
men of the victorious powers are now
gathered at Versailles to discuss the most
far-reaching and momentous peace terms
in the history ot civilization, “Vhe peo-
ples of the world are relaxing their mili-
tary and economic muscles; and, tho sull
breathing hard trom the recent: strug-
gle, have descended trom the plane of
unified ideals and intense purpose caused
by the terrible strain of war, As. the
dust of battle settles, there stands’ out
more clearly the supreme saerifice of
these of our fighting forces who laid
down their lives tor che cause, Let not
the statesman in his ardour for national
glory forget the Wounded and the Dead
in’ sectling the questions before him. God
have meres on the Politician, who causes
the blood of the Soldier to have been
shed in vain, by bringing about. thru his
selfishness and greed, a situation on the
earth which would be apart from uni-
versal Justice and Righteousness, And
the American heart may well glow with
pride in that it has a representative in
this Council of Nations who has not for-
gotten the Cause of Justice for which
American boys have died.

Those of us who did not go. feel a
natural delicacy in speaking af our com-
rades who went, and fell. But it makes
us all the more desirous of doing honor
to them, and in so doing this issue of
The Davidsonian, with the sincerest of
esteem for the Fallen and the deepest of
heartfelt’ sympathy for the loved ones
left behind, is humbly dedicated as a
memorial to the seventeen Davidson
men who have died for God and country.
We know that as a memorial it is not
worthy, but in the end the real memorial
is in the hearts of every. man in the Da-
vidson student body, and in the hearts of
every Davidson alumnus in the world.
Davidson is intensely proud of these men
and will before long, we hope, show this
esteem and honor by setting up a con-
crete memorial on the campus to their
name.

Death came upon them in different
ways, but we like to think of them all
as lying peacefully on some green hill
under a beautiful evening sky. We like

American Drives.

Lieut. Everett [.. Bone. ’2, has re-
turned ta his hame bere atter about six-
teen months’ service jn the army. En-
tering the Second Officers’ ‘Training
Camp on. August 27, 1907, he was seat
acres carly in the spring of 1948, ar-
riving at Brest. France, on April 6,
1918. He was in active service at the
front. far about four months, taking part
in the Second Battle of the Marne, the
ot. Mibict drive. anil serving in the Ar-
gonne Forest. When asked if he had
anv narrow escapes, he replied that there
was nothing but narrew escapes over
there, Lieutenant Booe was in’ Paris
jor a short time but did not have any
time tor “sight-seeing.” After his four
munths' service at the front, he was sent
back to this country as an instructor:
Ke arrived over heee October 13, 1918,
and was sent to Camp Gordon.

“Everett vill long be remembered
as one ob Davidson's finest athletes.
During his college course, he made the
“D" with three stars in football, “D”
and two stars tn baseball, and a “1D in
hath basketball and track. After leav-
iag here, he played baseball with the fol-
lowinf teams: Petereburg | (Virginia
Jaeague), Wheeling, Wo Va. «(Central
League). St. Paul. (American Associa-
tien), Indianapolis (Federal )

League).
and with Pittsburg in the | National
Leauue.

silence, with head uncovered. We Tike
to think ‘of a brief but beautifal service
hetng conducted, tollowed by the mili-
tary salute fired aver the graves; and as
the sun slowly sinks below the horizon
and the red glow of evening fades away.
and while the soldiers. in the gathering
stand at the salute, and the civilians
with their hats covering their hearts,
we like to think of taps being blown,
and echoed softly in the distance by a
second bugle.

THE -ALL-ROUND MAN.

“Bob” Miles has not only proven
himself a great stimulus. as a VY leader
an the campus, but he has been one of
the greatest factérs to encourage and,
assist-in athletics, Why? Because, his
record as a graduate of Davidson in ‘14
shows that he took a leading part in
athletics of every description.

-ln those days when the spirit in class
athletics was almost at its zenith, our
secretary was a member of the baseball
nine for two years. Nor did he. stop
here, for he played scrub football one
vear and class football another. In both
these phases of college sport he gave a
gond account of himself, but every ath-
lete has his “hobby.”

During the three years Mr. Miles
was a student here, he was a member of
the Varsity basketball quintet. ‘This was
his choice and in this he starred. Al
those who participated in or witnessed
the class games this season, would infer
this, after seeing the pep and knowledge
of the game which he displaved as a
referee. As captait of the team, in his
Senior year, he showed his worth as a
leader and the accounts of the contests
of that season show what a remarkable
record the “five” made.

And altho cight years have elapsed
since the end of his college days at D.
C.. Bob Miles has convinced the students
that he hasn't lost one ounce of pep and
enthusiasm.

-MEMORIAL GATES SUGGESTED.

A suitable memorial to the Davidson

men who have given their lives in the
service of our country has been suggested
by many on and off of the campus. In
every State in the Union similar monu-
ments are being erected in the henor ot
our noble dead, and we teel that chose
of our number who have offered up the
supreme sacrifice should be rensembered
by the very best monument we can s¢-
cure, ;
In making his suggestion, the writer
would like to call. your attention to Mer.
Juhn Nolan's plan for Greater David-
sop. tn this plan Alr. Nolan lett a

of the Eu Hall and facing Main street.
This place offers an opportunity for
beautitving the campus that should not

WAR WORK MONEY

The results of the war work  éam-
paign, which, was held in’ November.

ed that the people all over the country

gations that were striving to: make our
soldiers comforatable and happy.

given a chance to show their interest in
the War Werk Cauipaign by subscrib-
