PRELIMINARIES FOR
DEBATING TEAM HELD

Finals Will be at an Early Date—
Much Interest Being Manifested.

Phi Society.

Last Wednesday evening, to the
tune of the doom of democracy and
the rise of labor unions, 10 aspirants
for inter-collegiate debating honors
gathered to contest the matter to
a bloody finish in the Philanthropic
Society. Had Demosthenes and
Cicero been present at this exercise
they would have bowed their heads
with shame, such were ortorical
heights reached by these eloquent
and enthusiastic speakers. The hall
resounded with the vibrating tones
of the denouncer of labor and the
uplifter of capital ; of the pleader for
industrial representation, and the
advocate of labor’s rights.

The subject for debate was: “Re-
solved, That labor through represen-
tatives of its own choosing should
have a voice in the management of
industry. The debates were well
prepared and the contest was spirit-
ed throughout.

After a stormy session of about
two hours the victors emerged from
the fray, carrying their hard-won
laurels triumphantly off the field of
battle. After a very earnest delib-
eration, the judges awarded the
“reps” to the following orators: D.
M. Chalmers, R. E. McClure, C. K.
Brown and L. B. Schenck, with J.
M. Dunlap as alternate.

Ew Society.

Eumenean Literary Society held
preliminaries for intercollegiate de-
bating preliminaries last Wednesday
night. The judges, composed of
Drs. Shewmake, Lingle and Doug-
las, selected the group of McCaskill,
Liston, Ormand, A. B., and Mitchell,
with Gamble as alternate. The de-
bate was evidenced by much pep,
enthusiasm and rivalry and much
credit should be given to the for-
tunate men for their interest in pro-
moting the Eumenean Society.

Thursday Night Ushers in Junior Speaking

Glee Club is Practicing|Many Fair Visitors for|Wildcats Win With Whirl-

Nightly for Speaking

Effort Being Exerted to Give Splendid
Recital at Junior Speaking

Around 7:30 every night, stu-
dents passing under the stately oaks
around Shearer Hall, hearing melod-
ious strains wafted on the evening
breeze, pause as did Joan of Arc,
hearing voices. It is the Glee Club
rehearsing up in the chapel, and it
sounds mighty good. Down there
in the shadows you can hear the

martial strains of Gounod’s “Sol- S

diers’ Chorus” from the opera
“Faust”’—Grand Opera, fellows !—
and that bewitching hit “Sahara.”
Soul stuff, both of them; and that is
what the Glee club is putting out—
soul stuff—and in the most approv-
ed fashion.

In a few weeks Leader B. E.
Shields is going to tour the state
with his incomparable band of song-
birds. Among those cities of North
Carolina that will have the privilege
of hearing Davidson’s Glee club are
Bennettsville, Red Springs, Fay-
etteville, Greensboro, Winston-Sa-
lem, and Statesville. The local pa-
pers of the above named places will
give us a better idea of the excellent
ability of our Glee club after hearing
it than we can give here at this time.

Before this tour, however, David-
son will be entertained with a con-
cert by the Glee club. The Saturday
night during Junior Speaking has
been set as the date for their per-
formance on the hill, and The Da-
vidsonian heartily recommends to
every student on the Hill to be pres-
ent at this performance. Every song
of the Glee club is a hit, and every
member of that band puts the num-
bers over straight from the~—we al-
most said shoulder —heart. For
purity of harmony, appeal of tone,
beauty of interpretation, and skill in

rendering musical numbers, David- |.

son’s Glee club is unexcelled.

Dr. H. B. Arbuckle and his family
have played the host to the flu dur-
ing the past week. Dr. Arbuckle is
up and out now, and Mrs. Arbuckle

and Howard, the other two members

affected, have practically recovered.

Forensic Exercises
Expected

The Attractiveness of Speaking Will
be Greatly Increased by
This Fact

The secret is out. Whispered ru-
mors have been flitting to and fro
ore the campus for the past several
days to the effect that something
was to happen, and unlike many of
the tales which were current in the
. A. T. C. days, these rumors are
true, All efforts to keep the matter
quiet are at an end, for tomorrow
every one on the hill will have heard
all about it. Briefly: A casual vis-
itor to the college during the next
three days might quite excusably
mistake this institution of learning
for a young ladies’ seminary, for one
hundred and seven of the loveliest
maidens who ever smiled upon this
land which we call Dixie, will be

present for Speaking. No knight of |p),

old ever rode forth to uphold his
crest upon the field of tournament
under the auspicious conditions
which are to mark the Junior Ora-
torical exercises of the year nine-
teen hundred and twenty. The vis-
itors to be:

ringing up four goals in rapid suc-
cession, the Wildcats snatched vic-
tory from the hands of University of
South Carolina, and won by a 27 to

pecially the final period. Spetacular
shooting on the part of Skinner, for
S. C., drew applause from the gal-
lery time after time. In the latter
part of the first half, he was shoot-

goals. The half ended 21 to 10 in
favor of the University.

The second half started with a
tush, the Wildcats scoring 3 goals in
rapid succession bringing the score
up to 21 to 16. The play became a
little slow at this stage of the game
and five minutes before the whistle
blew, Carolina was leading 22 to 19.
Time out was called by Capt. Chal-
mers and after a minute’s instruc-
tion the team went back in and pro-
ceeded to play their opponent off
their feet. Goals by Romefelt, Rob-
erts, and Hall brought the score to
23 to 22 in favor of Davidson. With
