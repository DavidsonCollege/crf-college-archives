THE DAVIDSONIAN, SEPTEMBER 25, 1930

Rev. H. G. Bedinger is New
Head of Flora Macdonald

Has Already Assumed Presidency of
This Institution Located at Red
Springs

IS 1911 GRADUATE

Mr. Bedinger Succeeds Dr. C. G.
Vardell, Founder of the
College

Rev. Henry Graybill Bedinger, 1911 grad-
uate of Dafidson College, was elected this
summer and has assumed the presidency
of Flora Macdonald College, at Red Springs.
He was chosen as a successor to Dr. Chas.
G. Vardell, an 1888 graduate of Davidson,
who had heen president of that institution
since it was founded, and who retired to de-
vote his entire time to the teaching of Bible
in the college.

The new president of Flora Macdonald is
comparatively young, being only 41 years of
age. Mr. Bedinger entered Davidson from
Atlanta, Ga., and after his graduation he
spent two years as a teacher in the Mc-
Donald-Fraser School in Decatur, Ga., be-
fore entering Union Theological Seminary
at Richmond, Va.

Completing his course there, Mr. Bedinger
accepted a pastorate in the Asheville Pres-
hytery., His stay in that section was of short
duration, for he resigned to join the United
States Army in the World War. He served
as a chaplain and saw service overseas. ,

On his return with the American Expe-
ditionary Forces, Mr. Bedinger became pas-
tor of the Presbyterian Church at Harts-
ville, S. C., where he remained for 11 years
until he was called to the. presidency of
Flora Macdonald. He is widely known as
a minister in that state, and his worth was
recognized in his being appointed chairman
of the men’s work for the Synod of South
Carolina.

Dr. Vardell, who founded Flora Macdon-
ald College and became its first president,
withdrew from the presidency after several
efforts to resign that post, because he felt
that a younger man should have the reins
of office. Each time the board of trustees
insisted that he continue, but when his res-
ignation was tendered this past spring he
was emphatic in his intention to devote his
effort to the teaching of Bible at the insti-
tution where he has been such an important
factor.

WANTED

To make this page as interesting
and as attractive to alumni as pos-
sible. The alumni secretary cannot
do this single-handed, but needs in-
formation from the alumni about
themselves. As the president of one
class wrote to his classmates, “This
is no place to be backward or mod-
est.” The newspapers are scanned
carefully for items about you, but
the newspapers received in the
alumni office are from a limited
area.

If you know of the success of a
Davidson man near you, voluntarily
send this in. His friends would like
‘to know about it.

who are receiving invitations are P. McK.

It has also been suggested that the re-
tiring members don uniforms that day, and
run through some signals between halves of
the Davidson-V. P. I. contest. The officials,
however, have not definitely decided upon
this. A committee is working out every de-
tail for the entertainment and pleasure of
the men when they return.

son, who lives in Davidson, is a Sophomore
in the college. It will be recalled that Jack,
although a Freshman, played in competition
on the varsity golf team last year.

Wondering what made an em-
ployee steal won’t make good
the loss. The sure way to re-
cover on such losses is to carry
