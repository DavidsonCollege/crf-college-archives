Comptroller Releases

Budget For Athletics

By ALEC HOON
Managing Editor

The Administration released
this week a detailed analysis of
this year’s athletic budget, with
revealing breakdown’'s of the
football and basketball budgets.

The figures show that. the
college plans to spend only about
$469,847 or 14.5 percent of the
1972-73 budget for athletics,
with the majority of the money
going to football and basketball.

The Athletic Department
presently estimates that the
total income for football will be
$188,776, including $82,000 from
game receipts and guarantees
and $106,776 from the Wildcat
Club (to be used for football

scholarships).
The Comptroller Robert W.
Davidson, who released the

figures emphasized that these
numbers are all projections
rather than actual values. The

actual dollar values cannot be

calculated until later in the
year.
The total football expense’

comes to $348,139, of which
$171,776 is for scholarships,
$57,533 for direct game
expenses, and $118,830 for such
things as salaries, travel costs,
recruiting, and equipment.

The college must make up the
difference between the income
and the expenses, which for the
fiscal year 1972-73 is estimated
to be $159,363.

In contrast to this, the total
amounts of money that the
college allots to the minor
sports is far less than this sum.

Sailing gets $1100, track
$18.979. wrestling $12,824,
baseball $14,127, swimming
$8.496. and tennis $16,977.

The golf program receives
$7,137. soccer $11,801, and the
rifle team $1,412.

Senate Considers Activities Car

By TOM AINSWORTH
News Editor

The student Senate and the
administration are currently
investigating the possibility of
buying a student activities car.

In a special session Monday
night, the Senate approved in
principle the purchasing of the
car; however, an ad_ hoc
committee was formed to
investigate how the car would
be used.

If the committee approves the
mechanics of how the car will
be used, the Senate will petition
the Campus Tax Committee for
$500 and an additional $1200
contingent upon reimburse-
ment from the Traffic Fund.

The student government,
therefore, will contribute $1700
to the car, and_ the
administration will at least
match this amount in order to
purchase the vehicle.

The proposal for the activities
car originated as one of the
proposals of the Black Student
Coalition (BSC). The
administration asked the Senate
to act on the measure before the
BSC deadline for reply Nov. 15.

After deliberating for several
hours, the Senate was unable to
decide on the conditions for
such an activities vehicle, yet
thought that the idea itself was
worthwhile.

The proposal by the BSC
justifies a need for such a
vehicle by claiming that ‘the
social program of the college is
not as appealing ‘‘to black
students as to whites, and that
black students must" go away
from Davidson to find
“meaningful social activities.”

Also cited as a basis for the
proposal is the fact that fewer
cars are available to blacks
than whites.

Even though the’ Black
Student Coalition would have
special priority for the car's
use, other organizations such as
the YMCA, SGA and_ the
debating team would be able to
make use of it. The car would
not be available for use by any

athletic teams, however.

Dean of Students Will Terry
was on hand to present the issue
before the Senate on behalf of
the BSC and to answer
questions from the floor.

‘‘My real concern about this
is the college's relationship to
the needs of the black students.
The impetus for this comes
from the effort the college is
making to enable them to have
an adequate social program as
well as an academic one,”
Terry stated.

“We're not’ trying” to
embarrass anyone, or force the
SGA to go against its budget
needs, but we have here a
particular opportunity to make
a contribution to their
happiness and well-being,”
Terry continued.

Senator Bo Phillips expressed

his ‘‘resentment™ of the
Administration giving the
Senate such short notice to

confer on the matter and in
effect putting a deadline on
them.

Phillips also charged that it
was rumored that the
Administration had already
promised entering freshman
black students that such a car
would be available.

In response’ to _ both
allegations, Terry said of the
latter, “‘I am not aware of any
such committment to entering
black students. And yes, we
would like this proposal to be
part of our response on
Wednesday, because frankly I
believe that many, if not all, of
the complaints of the black
students are reasonable.

“If you feel on the spot, then

how do you think the rest of the
college feels? I think that all of
us by our negligence have
forgotten about these people
and have really done nothing
for them. The college is on the
spot and you're part of the
college,” replied Terry.

Senator Sue Schmidt felt that
getting an activities car instead
of providing an adequate social
life for. Blacks on campus was a
step in the wrong direction.

“IT can't say that a part of
what you said in not true,”
responded Terry. ‘This is
certainly not the solution for
social life improvements for
black students, but I hope that
this will be an intermediate
step.”

Terry pointed out that there
were no other accessible cars

budget amounts to $78,396
including intramurals.

The above figures represent
the money neccessary for the
total operation of the sports,
from the equipment to the game
expenses. These sports have no
income and so are. totally
funded by the college.

The basketball program is the
second most expensive item in
the athletic budget, needing a
grand total of $270,035 for
operation.

The athletic department has
made what Davidson termed a
‘conservative’ estimate of
their income from. ticket
receipts and guarantees as
$130,800.

He emphasized that this does
not include the money received
from any post-season play, the
sale of certain television and
radio rights for broadcast, or
unusually large crowds.

“When planning a budget, we
must make conservative
estimates so that we don’t have
an unexpected deficit in
income.

“This is more true of
basketball than football, which
has a more predictable income.
When basketball has a good
season, the income is often
higher than what we
anticipated,’’ Davidson said.

The total basketball expense
of $270,035 can be broken down
into $64,510 for scholarships,
$109,222 for direct game
expenses (such as guarantees,
referees, and scorekeepers).
and $96,303 for things like
salaries, recruiting, and
equipment.

Again, the college must make
up the difference between
income and expenses, which for
basketball comes to a projected
sum of $139,235.

Davidson stated that this
figure could be far less if the

New Facilities, Activities Possible Means
To Better Faculty-Student Relationships

By ALAN FORD
Staff Writer

(Ed. Note: This is the second
in a series of two articles on
faculty-student relations. Last
we examined the problems; this
week we look at some solutions. )

Although faculty and students
may possess good ‘‘teacher-
pupil’ relationships, personal
or social relationships between
these groups have
disintegrated.

Davidson advertises that a
small liberal arts college allows
for close contact between
faculty and students; but in fact
neither students nor faculty
take advantage of Davidson's
smallness.

To describe the gap between
students and faculty is one
thing. but to bridge that gap is
even more difficult.

One possible solution 1s _ for
the college to provide some

common ground where students
and faculty can meet naturally
and informally.

‘There needs to be a physical
facility which would draw
students and faculty together.”
said Professor of Economics
Robert Avinger. “‘At Duke
University the large cafeterias
serve this purpose.”

Some students suggested that
a new union would serve as a
meeting place for all members
of the college community. Until
such a facility is built others
suggested the use of
the Baxter-Davidson Room,
currently a faculty lounge, as a
central place in which students
and faculty might congregate.

One taculty member thought
that dorm lounges might be
more convenient for students
since meeting there would

foster closer relations between
the two groups.

Participation in extra-
curricular activities may be
another device to bring students
and faculty closer together.
Some students suggested that
more of an effort should be
made to include the faculty in
Union programs.

One faculty member
recommended that faculty
should become more involved in
clubs and organizations of the
college. Clubs provide an area
of mutual interest and provide a
lot of fun for both the student
and faculty members,’ said
French Professor Hallam
Walker. Walker is the sponsor
for the Davidson Outing Club
and the Davidson Sailing Club.

Another means to. bring
students and faculty closer

together might be _ joint
participation in community
acitvities.

There are several avenues
open to students who choose to

do this. One Davidson
sophomore, Rusty Saylor , is
the choir director for a
Davidson church. Other

students work in the Davidson
day-care centers on a volunteer
basis.

“Students and faculty
involved in community affairs
such as the church, sports, the
Boy Scouts and Sunday School
classes gain new areas of
common _interests,’" said
Professor of History Brown
Patterson. Patterson, vicar of
St. Alban’s Episcopal Church in
Davidson, added that ‘**my work
as a minister has helped in
contacts with students.”

Particiaption in these
organizations also allows a
student to meet faculty
