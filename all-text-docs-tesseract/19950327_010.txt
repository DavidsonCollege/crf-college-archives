Music Review:

Group in Perspective

Indigo
Girls: A
fan’ s eye
view

By Tom Bavis
Music Critic for The Davidsonian

~ Since the late 1980's, Atlanta’s
Indigo Girls have quietly and con-
sistently put out wonderful albums
of poetic folk rock. Sharing nearly
equal singing, songwriting, and
guitar-playing responsibilities,
Amy Ray and Emily Saliers are
folk’s Wonder Twins.

Amy comes from the Bob
Dylan and Neil Young schools of
music. She goes for the jugular
every moment — distilling com-
plex ideas into simple lines and
simpler chord progressions. Emily
takes a more ornate approach, fol-
lowing the style of one of her idols,
Joni Mitchell. Typically, her songs
have twice as many chords and
more sophisticated, roundabout
words.

As someone who has listened
to each of the Indigo Girls’ six
releases a hundred times, I have
caught on to their art, their mes-
sage, and their progress. Here is an
overview of their albums.

STRANGE FIRE. Released in
1989 by Epic after their major la-
bel debut succeeded, this was origi-
nally a self-made, all acoustic
project from 1987. Already their
talent has fully bloomed — many
of these songs are my very favor-

ites. When they want to inspire, as
on the title song (“I come to you
with my offering/I give you strange

fire”), they inspire. When they
choose to bring you down, they do;
Emily’s “Left Me a Fool,” one of
the most powerful tales of heart-
break ever written, is a good ex-
ample. Though not the only excel-
lent song on Strange Fire, “Left
Me a Fool’ alone demands this
albums’s placement in any Indigo
Girls collection.

INDIGO GIRLS. Most fans
claim their 1989 major label debut
has never been improved upon.
Coincidentally, /ndigo Girls boasts
superlative sales and the Girls’ only
hit single, “Closer to Fine.” Emily
and Amy approach the ten songs of
Indigo Girls in two ways: some
are like “Closer to Fine” and flesh
out the twin acoustic guitar attack
with excellent harmonies, percus-
sion, and extra background instru-
ments. The rest are like “Tried to
Be True,” where acoustic guitars
play a bit part in mellow rock ar-
rangements. There are-no weak
songs on this album, and the lyrics
prove even more consistently
strong than on Strange Fire. Take

Something to write about ...

Novelist Sheri Reynolds awards freshman

By JoHN CopENHAVER
Arts & Living Editor

Last Monday evening all the
freshman writers and English pro-
fessors gathered together in the

| 900 Room anxiously awaiting the

announcement of the R. Winley
Hall Award for the best selection
of creative writing from the fresh-
man class. The judge and speaker,
novelist Sheri Reynolds, graciously
announced the awards, relieving
the tense expectation heating the
room,

The first place winner was
Amber Sharick’s collection of po-
etry called Walking the Earth.
Lorraine Eadie’s nonfiction piece
Meredith and Nathan Raley’s un-
titled work won second and third
places, respectively.

Stacey Thompson’s work
Wandering Thoughts and. John
Roe’s work A Memory Bronzed

won enone mentions.

After the awards were given,
Sheri Reynolds'89, shared her own
spellbinding work. First she read
froma novel which she iscurrently
writing. Her use of colloquial
language and unique metaphors
brought a sparkling realism to her
first person narrative aboutachild’s
struggle to understand the down-
fall of her self-destructive mother.

She continued her presenta-
tion by reading two passages from
her first published novel, Bitter-
root Landing.

Her maincharacter, Jael, fights
to find peace with herself after a
hard and abusive childhood.
Reynolds’ storytelling ability is
both enthralling and unique. She
uses characters imagined in Jael’s
mind to support her main
character’s growth.

Once again her language and
style make characters believable
and identifiable — truly bringing

them to life.

Watching Sheri Reynolds giv-
ing out the R. Winley Hall Award
was watching one writer passing

the courage and inspiration to keep
on writing to other promising writ-
ers. She is truly an example for all
Davidson writers to follow.

Drumming up a new age

in music:
ASE (Ah-Shay) visits the 900 Room

By Dave WILLIARD
Staff writer

In an age of increased intra-
cultural communication, world
music has led the way by synthe-
sizing different national traditions
tocreate new musical forms. West-
erners may be most familiar with
Peter Gabriel’s and Paul Simon’s
recent efforts to meld African and
Western structures.

The ASE Drumming Circle’s
(pronounced Ah-Shay) Saturday
performance inthe 900 Room dem-
onstrated a union of African, Car-
ibbean, South American, and West-
ern musical traditions.

ASE also did it with an all-
female cast of Caribbeans and Af-
rican-Americans. The six person
group, based in New York, has
performed for three years and has
played dates in London and
throughout the United States.

ASE’s two-set performance
included several Haitian songs, an
original spiritual poem, an Old
Testament Psalm, and several West
African traditional chants.

Along with a solid harmonic
sense, the group is rhythmically
adept at African-style drumming.
The members of ASE combined
on an original song and synchro-
nized six African shakeres into a
forceful rhythm. Four members
took solos at this time, and here the
group’s rhythmic solidity shone.

In a creative sense, Western
music’s complex harmonic stress

is akin to African drumming’s
polyrhythmic feel.

African rhythms juxtapose a
three beat meter over a four beat
stress. Known as 6/8 time, this
effect is African drumming’s ma-
jor contribution to world music.
ASE succeeded in solidly combin-
ing both Western harmony and
African polyrhythms.

The group played on a variety

of percussion instruments, includ-
ing bells, the African shakere,
woodblocks, and congas. During
the show, Phyllis Bentley, the
drumming circle’s manager, said
that “‘we have been told that these
instruments are too powerful for
women to be playing.”

Later, Bentley explained that
women for so long have had to
play like men to be accepted, but

now there are enough master fe-
male drummers that women are
able to draw from their female
energy instead of having to con-
form to patriarchal maletraditions.

As an appropriate ending to a
powerful performance, ASE ended
with this chant: “Iamevery woman.
Everything you want done baby, I
shall do it rhythmically!”
