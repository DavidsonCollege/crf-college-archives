NCAA play-in game awaits conference champion

The women’s soccer team has
won three consecutive Southern
Conference championships and re-
turns arguably its best squad in years.
But no one is picking the Wildcats
to repeat. ,

That’s because UNC Greens-
boro, a national powerhouse ranked
21st in the pre-season polls, enters
the conference this season.

“Tt’s come at a good time for us
and the conference,” coach Kevin
Hundley said of the new arrival.
“We're going to have to be better
than we’ve been in the past.
“Despite winning three cham-
pionships and returning our most
experienced team, we’re not going
to be picked to win the conference.”

But instead of cowering in the
shadow of a national contender, the
Wildcats are looking’ for yet an-
other league title and a shot at the
NCAA tournament in a play-in
game against the Big South titleist:

“For the first time it’s in our

team over the summer. Star goal-

the NCAAs, Schmidt is more con-

keeper Allie Noznesky is one team-
mate who has taken notice.

“You can really see it in Kelly
and Amy’s play. They’re a. lot
quicker and a lot more decisive.”

As freshmen last season,
Rennick and Balsinger started ev-
ery game, as did leading scorer
Ginny Dye. Dye will play midfield
and forward this year, and she’ is
willing to sacrifice personal glory
for the improvement of the team.

“I’m not going to put the ball in
the net solcanbe the leading scorer,”
she said. “I’m going to do it so we
can win games.”

Dye and Rennick were both
all-conference selections last sea-
son as freshmen, and Noznesky (see
story) was named conference player
of the year.

“We’ ve got very high expecta-

tions of Allie in goal,” Hundley

committee's,” Hundley said.
And the players know it.
“We wanta bidtothe NCAAs,”
said midfielder Amy Balsinger, a
member of last year’s all-tourna-
ment team. Fellow midfielder and
‘roommate Kelly Rennick reiterated
the team’s desire to play, in the
NCAAs., ©
“Kelly and I want to maintain
control of the ball,” Balsinger ex«
plained. ‘‘We want to score, but as
* center midfielders we also need to
‘create plays by dominating the
middle of the'field.”
In preparation for this year, both

nior captain at all.

“Tjust really love it. It’s apower
trip,” Noznesky explained. “Being
a goalkeeper, you tune everything
out and every time the ball goes by
you, that’s a game you lost. Youcan
be on for 88 minutes, and if you’re
off for two, you’ re screwed and the
team’s done.

“T do like the challenge of hav-
ing to be on for 90 minutes and

knowing that if I play a good game, -

- chances are we can come out on top.

I really do enjoy knowing that that
rests on my shoulders.”

‘Fellow senior Amy Kanoffalso
enjoys having Noznesky tend the.
net. ,

“At conference tournament
time she really steps up,” she said.
“We didn’teven have a goal scored
on us in last year’s tournament.”

Kanoff, Noznesky, and stop-
per Kelly Schmidt are the senior
captains on this year’s squad. While
everyone on the team wants to go to

cerned with the regular season for
now.

“We need to winevery game in
our conference,” she said. “With
UNCG coming in, no one is expect-
ing us to win it, so there’s less
pressure on us. But we need to take
it one game at a time.”

Kanoff also noted that a strong
non-conference schedule will help
in the long run.

“We usually hold our own © |

against those teams until the end of
the game,” she said, referring to the
five overtime games that they lost
last year, including ones against
North Carolina St. and UNCG.
“We just didn’t have it at the
end,” Schmidt agreed. “This year
we'll have the depth to win those

“games.”

The reason for such depth is is
the play of the freshmen. Forward

But that doesn’t bother the se-

could enter the fray at forward, while
Ida Wainschel has looked solid on
defense.

Goalkeepers Winnie Corrigan
and sophomore Chesley Garrett are
more than adequate backups for
Noznesky.

- “We're going to be a really
deep team,” Noznesky said. “I think
we have the best tedm that’ we’ ve

had so far. We should finish one or’
‘two in the conference. And if we

don’t, I think that’s a failure on our
part.

When I was a freshman, we

had people starting who couldn't
even make the team now,’

That improvement has given a)

the Wildcats an opportunity to do
something that no other Davidson
women’s team has done: make the
NCAA tournament at the Division I
level.

“IT don’t think UNCG is un-
beatable,” Noznesky said. “I think
we can goas far as the second round
of the NCAAs.”

freshman year,” Hundley joked. -
“She made a complete transforma- ;

tion.

“There had to be some pretty
‘serious introspection on her part. I
would guess she matured to a point
where she said she was going to do
. something rather than just go
through the motions.”

“Sports and school always
came really easy for me,” the 5-
foot-6 senior captain explained.
“Coming to Davidson was great for
me. I was upagainst all these people
who were better than me. It has
been a perfect experience so far.”

To say the least.

After a promising set of spring
workouts at the end of her freshman
--year,Noznesky started all 22 games

her sophomore season, posting 117
saves, seven shutouts, and a goals
against average of 1.15.

_Asa junior, she only got better;
lowering her GAA to an infinitesi-
mal 1.05 en route to becoming the
first and only goalkeeper in South-

“ern Conference history to be named
the league’s player of the year.

And she has never allowed a

goal in conference tournament ac-

tion, logging four shutouts in lead-
ing Davidson to its second and third
consécutive tourney titles.

“You feel. so comfortable with

her back there,” said Ginny Dye, f

- whojoined Noznesky.on last year’s

all-conference roster. “She’s going
to do everything she can to keep the

- ball out of the net.”-

So, having already achieved
virtually every individual or team

honor the Southern Conference has

to offer, what now?

Noznesky — and the rest of the
team as well — is talking NCAA
tournament — something that has
never before been accomplished by
a Davidson women’s team at the

Division I level.

“T think we can go as far as the
second round,” Noznesky predicted.

“T’ ve been really lucky to play with
a good team for the last three years,
and I want to repay them for that. I
want to get them as far as possible.”
And what does Hundley ex-
pect from his superstar keeper?

“She will do what she’s ca- :

pable of,” he said. “I’m not sure
what that is, but I'd certainly be

happy to see her do what she did last.

year.

“The job is hers. Barring an
injury or some calamity, she’s go-
ing to play the important minutes
this season. She’s earned that right.”

~ Some teams like to start off the
season with easy non-conference
games to assure a few wins. The
women’s soccer squad is not one of
them.

The defending Southern Con-
ference champions travel to Co-
lumbia, S.C., Aug. 31 to battle South
Carolina, a team that coach Kevin
Hundley thinks will be one of the
best teams the Wildcats play this
year. Last year, the Wildcats beat

_ the Gamecocks 2-1 ona late goal by

Ginny Dye.

The home-opener is Sept..3-

against Clemson, the 20th-ranked
team in the nation. Last year’s 4-1
loss to the Tigers on hostile turf was

_ one of their worst losses of the s sea-

son. é
_ “Those are big-time games,”
Kelly ‘Schmidt said. “This year we’ ll
~ have the depth to win them.”
Kelly Rennick knows the first

~ “Tvl let us know where we

. Stand against the big schools,” she

said. “Hopefully we'll do well, but °

if we don’t, then we’ll know what

we need to work on to get better.” .
Another giant looming over this

-year’s schedule is UNC Greens-

boro, one of.three new conference
teams. The two other newcomers
are Wofford and East Tennessee St.
The Spartans of. UNCG are
tanked 21st in the nation and will
pose an immediate threat to the
Wildcats’ recent supremacy when
they meet Oct. 7 at Richardson Field.
That bout could be a preview
of the conference championship
match, a game whose stakes are
higher this year than ever before.

the Big South champion. The win-

“That would be a great climax
to the season and it would mean a
lot for women’s sports at Davidson,”
Hundley said. “No women’s team
here has ever gone toa Division I
NCAA tournament.”
