Hasty returns to flock as Davidson’s chaplain

By MARGARET CARROLL

Chuck Hasty, a familiar face
on the Davidson College cam-
pus, recently returned as
Davidson's new chaplain. Af-
ter two years without a chap-
lain, Davidson chose Hasty,
‘83 graduate of Davidson, to
fill the position.

“Since Davidson has not had

a chaplain for the past two.

years, | havea lotof freedomin
shaping the role of chaplain,”
said Hasty. “I want to be the
chaplain for all aspects of the
college: students, faculty, and
staff, not just for the Chris-
tians.”

One of Hasty’s main goals
for the upcoming year is to
create a warm climate for
community on campus and in
the town of Davidson as well.
By participating in services at
Davidson College Presbyte-
rian Church and Davidson
Presbyterian Church, Hasty
hopes to unite the community.

As Davidson’s chaplain,
Hasty, along with the mem-
bers of the Chapel Committee,
will be responsible for pro-
gramming events for the Tues-
day Eleventh Hour worship
services weekly. “I’m excited
that the college has set aside
these hours as a time to build

community, and I see it.as_a
great opportunity to do just
that,” said Hasty.

He says he hopes to bring to
the campus new and unique
programs, including dance,
drama and other worship
forms, in order to show that
there are many ways to wor-
ship God. His aim is that these
programs will appeal to many
students and will make more
options for worship available
on campus.

Hasty says that many college
students today seem to be
yearning for both intellectual
and spiritual influence in their
lives, and he wants to help
provide opportunities for in-
vestigating questions and con-
cerns for those who are and
who are not already involved
in religious life on campus.

“I would like to be visible
and available to all students,”
said Hasty. “When students
are ready to ask questions or
just to talk, they can come to
me.”

Hasty anticipates working
with the staff and faculty of
Davidson and hopes to serve
as a liaison between them and
the students in certain situ-
ations.

He says he would like to plan

2z

discussion groups on AIDS,
dating, divorce, racial issues
and any other topics that stu-
dents might like to discuss. He
would also like to plan some

‘international mission trips as

well as to continue past proj-
ects that the chaplain’s office
has sponsored such as Aware-
ness Weekend, discussion din-
ners, week of prayer for Chris-
tian unity, and the Martin Lu-
ther King, Jr. Gospel fest.

Hasty is, originally from
Athens, Georgia. After gradu-
ating from Davidson.in 1983,
he taught school in Kenya with
the Kenya Connection. He at-
tended Columbia Theological
Seminary, and at the end of his
second year Hasty had an in-
ternship as an associate pastor
in Tokyo, Japan at an interna-
tional interdenominational
church.

Hasty finished at Columbia
in May, 1989, and spent the
past summer at Georgia Bap-
tist Medical Center in Atlanta
participating in a clinical pas-
toral education program.

Since Hasty has come to
Davidson, many people have
asked, “What does a chaplain
do?” His typical response has
been, “I’m in the process of
finding that out myself!”

“I would like to be visible and available to all students,” says
Hasty, who is pictured here playing cricket in front of Chambers.

Looking at the world beyond Davidson

‘Thousands rush to Hungary’s open borders.

PEEL LACL PEAK

By CAROL GATEWOOD
HUNGARY: More than 16,000 refu-
gees have poured into Hungary
since it opened its borders last week.
In the midst of this historic exodus,
emigres on Sunday said that East
German and Czechoslovakian au-
thorities have stopped giving pass-
ports, travel documents and visas.

Other Warsaw Pact nations have
condemned Hungary’s willingness
to help refugees, but the Soviet Un-
ion has made no direct criticism to-
wards Hungary. The Washington
Post reported that Hungary did talk
with the Kremlin before it let East
Germans leave. Former ambassador
to East Germany Rozarine -Ridge-
way stated her belief that this was
probably true.

Meanwhile, West Germans have
ambivalent feelings towards this
exodus. Many skilled workers be-
lieve their jobs are jeopardized by
this new influx of competent work-
ers.

CHINA: For the first time in at least

three months, Deng Xiaopiang ap-
peared in public and named Jiang
Zemin his heir as leader om the Commu-
nist Party.

Jiang is described as “a cosmopolitan
technocrat” and he speaks both fluent
English and Russian.

The New York Times stated that Deng
hopes Jiang will be a more mainstream
leader, unlike Li Peng, and he has been
pinpointed for his policy of “economic
openness to the Western world.”

_ Deng still plays a large role in the
future of China’s political scheme, for

Jiang must not only win Deng’s “con-_.
tinued support,” but if Deng dies, the ©

new leader will undoubtedly be faced
witha power struggle.

Crime Prevention Tip -
Many people believe the

honor code'renders Davidson

a crime-free utopia. However,

as ls report BhOWs, thisis not

the case. Don't make yourself

-an easy victim.

This week’s tip is for joggers
and walkers. Even in
Davidson, running through
dark streets alone at 11 p.m. is
extremely dangerous. If you
must exercise at night, please
bring a friend. Another hint:
carry a can of mace (guys too).
