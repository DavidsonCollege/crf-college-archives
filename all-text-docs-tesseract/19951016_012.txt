THE DAVIDSONIAN

Catch the spirit of
Appalachian Regional Theatre

By Curisty SHI
Staff Writer

The Barter Theatre of Virginia
will surprise you. Set in Historic
Abingdon, Virginia, the Barter
holds its own intriguing history.
Founded in June, 1933 the Barter
opened to aide starving actors while
accommodating the inability of
most people to afford the luxury of

ON THE ROAD AGAIN

theater in those struggling years of
the Great Depression.

Admission in the first years
was 40 cents, or the equivalent in
produce — hence the name Barter.
At the end of the first year, how-
ever, the theater had two barrels of
jelly, $4.35, and a weight gain of
over 300 pounds! Shortly thereaf-
ter (especially in the years after
World War II) the theater began
accepting less and less produce,
and today, as in any other theater,
one must pay cash for a ticket.

The theater will be showing a

mystery called Dangerous Corner
through December 31; the Barter
Theatre Stage II (in a building
across the street) will be showing a
comedy, The Cow Pattys, through
January. The shows run Thursday
through Sunday evenings and Sat-
urday afternoon.

This matinee is your best bet if
you want to make it a day trip
rather than a whole weekend. Call
Barter Theatre’ at (800) 368-3240,
and be sure to ask about student
discount tickets.

While in Abingdon, be sure to
save time for lunch or dinner at the
Starving Artist Café. Anyone in
the town can tell you how to get
there, and the food is absolutely
wonderful. Each sandwich is
named for an artist, and the atmo-
sphere is pleasant, crisp, and bright.

While waiting for your table
at the Starving Artist, stop in at the
antique shop next door and browse
amongst furniture, crafts, and more.

If you are in Abingdon for
longer than an afternoon show, visit
the Arts Depot, where one can
watch resident artists at work.
Other similar art-related interests
are the Cave House Craft Shop and

the William King Regional Arts
Center. For the history majors out
there, try visiting the Fields-Penn
1860 House Museum and view the
lifestyle of an antebellum Virginia
town. Notto be forgotten is White’s
Mill and General Store, a Virginia
Historic landmark where a
waterwheel operates a flour and
grist mill daily.

There are several ways to get
to Abingdon, the easiest being to
take I-77 North to I-81 West. This
highway will carry you to
Abingdon, which is exit 19. A
lover of back country roads, I trav-
eled up I-77 to 21 North, through
the small towns of Cherry Lane,
Sparta, and Twin Oaks. At Twin
Oaks, I took 93 North to Mouth of
Wilson, getting on 58 West there.

This route will carry you straight —

into Abingdon, passing I-81 on the

.way. The trip takes about three

and a half hours this way, and the

beauty of the countryside will re-

fresh you in unexpected ways.

_ mation, feel free to contact me at

Abingdon Convention and Visi-
tors Bureau at (800) 435-3440. .

Album Review

Daydream carries Mariah to stratospheric heights

By RosBert Briccs
Staff Writer

It's been two years since
Mariah Carey ascended to the
throne of pop music with her
octuple-platinum album Music
Box. With her latest release, Day-
dream, Carey shows her diversity
and appears eager to expand the
boundaries of her current domain.
No longer relying on the over-
whelming production and vocal
pyrotechnics of old, Carey treats
her audience toa looser, more laid-
back sound.

The album opens with the
number one single, “Fantasy,” re-

uniting Carey with “Dreamlover”
collaborator Dave Hall. The duo
creates another masterful piece of
breezy, upbeat pop music, infus-
ing it with just enough hip-hop
rhythm to give the song nearly
infinite playability.

On “Underneath the Stars,”
Carey uses a dreamy retro rhythm
and cleverly layered vocals to cel-
ebrate the emotions of young lov-
ers. The sound even ventures to
straight R&B with “Always Be

_ My Baby” and “Long Ago.” The

latter is Carey’s farthest journey
from pop music yet, a song that
blends soulful vocals with a purely
hip hop music track.

Even with her new sound,
Carey includes some mature bal-
lads. “I Am Free” reflects Carey’s
religious influences, celebrating the
power of God and featuring dra-
matic gospel instrumentation. The
power of love is the theme of both
“When I Saw You,” and “Forever,”
which serve as. the two best ex-
amples of Carey’s newfound vocal
restraint. For her adult R&B audi-
ence, there is the melodic ballad
“Melt Away,” acollaboration with
Babyface. In a wonderful display

of vocal control, Carey not only
showcases her lower register but
harmonizes it with her upperrange.
The album ends with the autobio-
graphical “Looking In,” Carey’s
moving attempt to tell the world
that there’s more to her than her
Cinderella story suggests.

Of course, no Mariah Carey
album would be complete without
the radio-friendly, potential home-
run songs. A vocally charged cover
of the Journey hit “Open Arms”
begs to be released and start its
move up the charts.

The album’s next definite
smash hit can be found in “One
Sweet Day.” This heart-wrench-
ing duet with Boyz II Men is about
losing loved ones that you took for
granted. While the two acts sing
the verses independently, the emo-
tion of the song soars to strato-
spheric heights when all five voices
blend together.

With a plethora of potentially
hit singles, backed by the incred-
ible depth provided by Carey’s new
overall sound, it would take the
collective efforts of the entire pop
music world to prevent her wildest
Daydream from coming true.

Stir it up:

Shrimp

By Ros Kosicki & JAY SHULTZ
Chefs-in-residence

The best thing about stir-fry is
its versatility. There are countless
ways to prepare this easy, but very
tasty dish. We will share with you
our recipe for shrimp stir-fry while
also giving several variations you
may find better suits your taste
buds.

The easiest and least expen-
sive way to make your stir-fry is to
purchase a stir-fry packet that al-
ready contains the necessary herbs
and spices for the perfect season-
ings. These packets can be used
for shrimp, chicken; pork, beef, or
vegetable stir-fry. A wide variety:
of these packets, ranging from
$0.68-$1.50, can be found in aisle
three at Harris Teeter. Boneless
chicken breast is $4.29 Ib, pork
loin is $3.99 lb, and large shrimp
(unpeeled) are $8.99 Ib.

Also, a number of different
kinds of vegetables can be added
to your stir-fry.

For this recipe, you will need
the following:

1 packet of stir-fry seasoning mix
1-1!“ lb. of meat of your choice

2 tsp. of vegetable oil

lots of rice (optional)

Assorted vegetables:

1 green or red bell pepper, sliced

1 medium onion, sliced

1 medium head of broccoli

1 8 oz. package mushrooms, sliced

If you prefer to make a veg-
etable stir-fry, you may wish to
purchase ‘a pre-packaged assort-
ment of sliced vegetables avail-
able in the produce section.

Stir-Fry

To begin, peel and clean the
shrimp under running cold water,
or if you are using meat, cut the
meat into | inch cubes. Mix stir-
fry packet seasoning in a bowl
with 1/3 cup of water and set aside.
Heat vegetable oil in a skillet or
wok on med-high heat. Cook meat
4-5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Add vegetables and cook for an
additional 2 minutes. Next, pour
seasoning mixture into skillet and
cook 2 more minutes, stirring oc-
casionally. Serve over rice if de-
sired. Success Boil-In bags of rice
are an excellent choice; they are
easy to cook and taste fine. One
bag of rice is enough for 3-4 people.
These bags of rice take 10 minutes
to cook in boiling water, so start
the rice cooking at the same time
you add the meat into the skillet.
Enjoy your stir-fry ... until we cook
again.

thing to those who could not.at-
tend, he expressed his sadness at

the fact that more American stu-

dents do not get a chance to learn
about African dance and culture
from reliable sources, He warned
against the maiy false prophets of
African dance, who have been
given acclaim in the U.S. and
Canada although they are not prop-
erly educated in dance and culture
themselves.

On behalf of all of the students
who attended his show, and indeed
the whole school, I would like to
thank Kofe for gracing us with his
many talents.
