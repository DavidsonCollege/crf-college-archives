Sunday Scheduling Policy
Cost Cagers TV Broadcast

Due to a standing policy
against scheduling athletic
events on Sunday, Davidson
missed an opportunity to play
basketball on national
television.

The Cats were asked to
change the day and time of their
contest with St. Johns from
Saturday night, Jan. 6, to the
following afternoon so they
could be part of a day-long
college basketball broadcast.

The program was scheduled
to begin with the Davidson
game, follow with a game from
the midwest, and close with a
showing from the west coast.

According to Athletic Direc-
tor Tom Scott, plans for the
program have been scrapped
due to a lack of a sponsor.

Sherrill’s

The decision not to reschedule
the game was made because of
a standing college policy that
prohibits scheduling athletic
events on Sunday, according to
President Samuel R. Spencer
Jr.

He said Davidson teams were
allowed to play special games.
such as make-up games, on
Sunday, but that this game
could not be rescheduled.

“This matter is really a
trustee decision, and would
have required a ruling from
them,"’ he said. He added he did
not have the power to change
the policy.

He said he plans to ask the
trustees to change the policy
when they meet this fall.

Fagg Pleased With Gridders
Cats Tackle L-R Tomorrow

By JOE EARLE
Sports Editor

For the first time in several
years, Dave Fagg, head coach
of the Davidson Wildcats, can
afford to be a happy man.

His team is winning. The Cats
defeated the Keydets of VMI
last week 18-14 for their first
Southern Conference win in two
years, and fought for a close
decision in their opening loss to
Wake Forest.

With a 1-1 season record, and
a 1-0 conference standing, the
Cats are presently tied for the
lead in the conference, a
distinction Davidson has not
had since 1970.

The team gives every in-
dication of extending their
winning record with tomorrow's
game at Lenior Rhyne.

Lenoir Rhyne has a small
team, and bases their attack on
their running game. They run
an offense built from a com-
bination of the old single-wing
formation and the wishbone

Spencer said he did not wish
to ask the trustees to reschedule
this game because there was no
great advantage in the
rescheduling.

“It really wouldn't have
made much difference in the
money involved," he said.

The decision upset some
members of the team, and one
sent him a letter of protest.

Davidson will have two
basketball games televised, ac-
cording to Scott—the contest
with The Citadel and the game
with Richmond.

According to Fagg, the team

relies heavily on their

backs, especially halfback
Robinson, although they can
switch to a passing game if
needed.

Fagg also said that the team
will have a transfer student
playing this week that was not
eligible for their 12-7 win over
Wofford last Saturday.

The Cat defense has proved
itself fairly adept at handling an
opponents running game. They
held VMI to only 11 yards on the
ground in 26 carries last week,
and forced four fumbles. They
also scored for the Cats, forcing
a safety.

Fagg said he was interested
in starting a regular series of
games with Lenior Rhyne. In
years past they have had a
powerhouse small college team,
and he is interested in trying to
lay the groundwork for a

rivalry.

“They have a tradition of
winning at that school that is
almost unrivaled. They have
regularly had good teams,
although they have dropped off
some in recent years,’’ he said.

Fagg had only praise for the
performances his players have
given in their first two games.

He first pointed out the play of
the team’s two quarterbacks,
Scotty Shipp and Dave Harper.

Shipp’s passing attack made
up a good deal of the Cat offense
in the Wake Forest game,
where the team passed for 276
total yards. He was knocked out
of the VMI game and Harper
filled in for him. Harper had a
good passing game, hitting five
of 13, including one touchdown

pass.

Fagg also praised Gary

Pomeroy’s punting, saying he is
averaging about 40 yards a

punt, well over the Cat average
for last year.

He happily recounted an
incident in the Wake Forest
game when the ball was cen-
tered over Pomeroy’s head.
Pomeroy scrambled, got the
ball and punted it from between
three Wake defenders, ac-
cording to Fagg, sending it
downfield over 50 yards.

The team has begun to feel
the effects of the season, and is
beginning to suffer from in-
juries, but Fagg’s optimism has
not been daunted.

Although several starters
have been put out of action
temporarily, no player has been
forced to retirement for the
season as yet.

“I would say that although we
have suffered some injuries, we
are better off now than I thought
we'd be at this time,” Fagg
stated. ‘‘We are in pretty good

So, for the first time in
several years, the team can
enjoy the elation of a winning
season. And they do.

“Every day before practice I
take time to remind the boys
about the score of the VMI
game,” Fagg said. ‘‘We just
take a minute or two off to enjoy
it.”’

Net Practice Opens

The Davidson tennis
team will begin their fall
practice Wednesday, Sep-
tember 27.

Any student interested
in playing tennis should
report to net coach Harry
Fogleman’'s office in the
tennis house Wednesday.

SPEAKING HERE

‘‘We know little or nothing about our own

selves ..

. the true profit of life is to know

one’s self. Understand the true profit of life.
‘What does it profit a man if he gains the
possessions of the whole world and loses his

own soul?’

Theoretically, no doubt,

we have done so

much, we have learned so many philosophies
about all these subjects, but practically we do
not know who we are. Can we separate our
self? Can we know the indweller of the house?
Is our inner eye open to see the Light of God?
These are the practical subjects.

‘‘Know thy self! If you know your self prac-

tically, you can separate your self . .
are, what youare. .

. who you
_ only then you will be in

a position to know, to see, to come into contact
with that great Reality Which you call ‘God’,

not before."
