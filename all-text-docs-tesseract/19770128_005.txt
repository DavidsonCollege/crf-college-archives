To the Editor:

We were both encouraged and
discouraged by the Focus on Crime
and Security in the last issue of The
Davidsonian. While the Watford
committee and the editorial by Cathy
Landis expressed very positive ideas,
the remainder of the Focus section
gave the impression that the David-
son police department is incompetent
and totally to blame for the security
problem. This could not be further
from the truth. Students express a
lack of confidence in the security

ae

force, however, they also display a
lack of communication, or desire to

<\_ communicate, with the police. We fail

to see how the attitude that ‘‘they
won't do anything anyway, so we just
won’t bother to call,’’ helps in any
way to solve the problem—it only
compounds it.

Recently we had the opportunity to
sit down the two police officers in the
Union and discuss the security prob-
lem at Davidson. We saw the situa-
tion from a side we’re not so sure the
majority of students even acknow-
ledge exists—the policeman’s view-
point. The police are completely
aware of the problem and are the first
to admit that something has to be
done about it. They are all for
improving the police-student relation-
ship. They would like very much to
get to know the students, and to sit
down and work this problem out to-

Honor code prevents
Prison of fear aura

To the Editor:

In last week’s Focus concerning the
security (or lack of it) here at
Davidson, I found some things I
didn’t like. The students were tagged
with such remarks as ‘“‘heads in the
clouds,’’ ‘‘apathetic,” ‘unaware,”’
while the College was referred to as a
“utopia where theft is a joke.” I think
such pointed remarks deserve equally
pointed rebuttals.

Davidson is a utopia. It is a world
unto itself, unspoiled by the problems
enjoyed by our larger society. It is an
academic shangri-la where we can
study without the pressures of ‘‘real”
life. This is why many of us came
here. Here smaller problems of study
and interpersonal relationships are
emphasized, and the larger-scale ill-
nesses of the world take the back seat.

It is an ideal-filled world. We do
have our heads in the clouds because
we believe in an honor code that
works. It is a code that requires blind
trust in oneself and fellows, a naive
belief in the goodness of men. What
will happen to this trust if the
Davidson student is made ‘“‘aware’’?

The police have proven undeserving
of this trust and the administration is
little better. If we are forced to lock
our doors, bar our windows, and
constantly glance over our shoulders,
who shall we trust?

Davidson is a residential college
(according to the catalog), where
people are encouraged to live on
campus to perpetuate an atmosphere
of friendliness. Should it remain a
residential institution if ‘‘the college
cannot protect ‘its students against
their own stupidity’’? Does this mean
that we will be required to live on
campus, unless we have permission to

do otherwise, but cannot expect
protection for us and ours?

I do not see myself as ‘‘stupid’’ or
“‘unaware’’ when I leave my room
unlocked during a meal, or while
studying in the library. Such deper-
sonalization resembles a prison at-
mosphere more than it reflects the

idea behind what Davidson is. It is fey ra Few 5 p Y

big school impersonalization and iso-
lation in a college which supposedly
has neither of these characteristics. It
will not work and still be Davidson.
Do not misunderstand me. I do not
want to throw my possessions to the
dogs, blindly trusting in man’s hu-
manity to man. We should not,
however, be forced to become prison-

ers of our own fear. The police force B®

gether. This would seem to have
much more potential as a solution
than attacking the department’s com-
petency.

Students must realize that police
are human, too; they cannot be
everywhere at the same time. While
they make mistakes, they also handle
things most of us would not dream of
doing. The article on the Etcetera
break-in implied that the whole
problem was that the police did not
hear the alarm go off and were not in
the area. We fail to see how the alarm
could have gone off for as long as was
indicated without someone, policemen
or anyone else, hearing it. The article
failed to point out that when the
alarm recently went off falsely, a
Davidson police unit was on the scene
in less than 30 seconds. Too often the
bad aspects of a situation make us
blind to the positive ones.

We agree completely with Landis’
statement that there is a ‘‘general
feeling of apathy among the students
toward tightening security meas-
ures.’’ The Honor Code may work fine
for the students, but we must realize
that unfortunately all of the people

who come on campus (such as during
basketball games) do not live by our
standards. Leaving doors unlocked at
times such as these is only inviting
trouble—the police cannot and should
not be expected to be watching every
student’s room al the time.

The Watford committee is to be
commended; they are headed in the
right direction. Perhaps a major
source of input for the committee
might be the patrolmen themselves—
the committee is already aware of the

: students’ feelings. But the committee

cannot do it alone; all the students
must be interested enough to do
something about the problem, rather
than just sit back and complain about
it, or ignore it. Neither group, the
police or the students, can solve the
problem without the other's cooper-
ation. Unless we take positive steps
to improve our communication and
relations with the police, any new
guidelines will be ineffective and will
only serve to temporarily accomodate
the problem rather than alleviate it.

Analogy advocates plunge into life -

By MEREDITH HALL

Psychological Counselor
I met a soldier once. Now I’ve met a
lot of soldiers but this was an old
soldier. He’d been fighting for over 65
years. You don’t believe it? But it’s
true. Really, sixty five years or close
to it. He sat down to talk with me,

@ taking a little rest before he was on

his way. Soldiers often pick me to talk
to, I think because I don’t look very
soldier-like.

I’ve had my times. I don’t mind
admitting they’ve nearly had me a
time or two. But I’ve always made it.
Know why? Because I’ve always left
myself a way out. I never take anyone
else for granted—never depended on
anyone else but myself. Be prepared,
it’s not just a cliche to me, it’s been
everything.

“Who is the enemy?”

‘‘Who is the enemy? Don’t be
naive, boy. They are the enemy. You
look like you're past puberty. It’s a

wonder you haven’t been cut to
ribbons.”’

‘““W hat have you done to survive
such a long war?”’

“Well, basically I survived because
I built a good fort. I built that fort out
of knowledge whose basic component
was facts. They can’t get at you if you
know your facts. Many’s the time I’ve

launched a rocket attack with fact ,
after fact. It’s usually silenced them.

But it’s not just the fort; it was my
armamentarium.”

“Your what?”

“My armamentarium.”’

“Right.”

“Yes sir, my armaments consist of
many strategic weapons. I’ve got
scowls, plenty of scowls, I’ve got
syllogisms, aphorisms, jokes, rhetori-
cal questions, ' analogies, references,
flattery, verbosity. . .just to name a
few.”

“What’s your most powerful wea-

‘pon?’”’

‘For long range attacks there's
nothing like abstract logic. Short
range calls for logic too, sometimes.
Once they’re surrounded by my logic,
they unconsciously absorb it and
they’re whipped.”

“Boy!”

“*Boy,’ is that all you've got to say.
Don’t you see the beauty of my
system. Remember, war is hell.”

“Sounds too suspicious to me. I’m
not that energetic in my passions.”

‘‘OH ho. Wondered when you'd
mobilize against me. Well, I’ve held a
responsibility in life that the public
required. I’ve won,awards, achieved
retirement, and never spent a day in a
mental institution. No, not but
just sensitivity on security, protec-
tion from hurt, and removal from
risk. You'll learn or be a casualty. So
long.”

“Bye.”

Man, these old soldiers, they never
die but do they ever live?
