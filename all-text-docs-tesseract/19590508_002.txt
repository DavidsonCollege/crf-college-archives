A Matter Of Honor

At Davidson we have honor. We
can see it in our honor system, which
works. This honor system works on-
ly because each student holds as a
basic principle that it must work.

But honor is hard-put to be gath-
ered into a code. Sometimes we find
that we have kept a system without
honor. There are situations in which
the law can be avoided without break-
ing it. This is not honor. It is not
honor when we regard only specifical-
ly pledged work as applicable to con-
sider under an offense of honor. This
is system.

We are all guilty of this as in-
dividuals.

There are also situations in which
honor is not disturbed. but the law
is broken. This is hard to see, harder

yet to illustrate. But when a decision °

must be made, this fact is present.
to those who must judge.
We are guilty of this as a school.
Our honor system cannot be more
than imperfect. Its imperfection rests

on us as individuals. We cannot hope
to eliminate situations of systems
without honor. But we must and can
take necessary steps to lessen the
necessity of honor without system.

The DAVIDSONIAN recommends
at this time that the student council,
the honor court, the administration
and the trustees carefully consider
revising the absoluteness of the honor
violation. This should be made retro-
active to cover all cases ever brought
before the student council or honor
court.

Honor must be maintained. Break-
ing it necessitates the paying of a
hard price. But it is our duty to give
those who have made the mistake of
their lives the opportunity to redeem
their honor back at Davidson.

‘Being permitted to return after
a suspension of two years would give
a man the opportunity to prove to
himself and to his school that in the
final analysis he has found honor, not
lost it, through his mistake.

Court Stays, But
NeedsImproving

The Student Council has made its
choice for Judge of the Court of Con-
trol. And Milton Gee has accepted
‘what many consider an unenviable
position.

Needless to say, last year was a
hectic one for the court, but. perhaps
this should have been expected. The
overburdened regulations and upper-
classman conduct could hardly be ex-
pected to impress a young group of
sophisticated future Davidson gentle-

men.

For better or for worse, the court
is still with us. It is evident that a

reconsideration of the regulations
must be made if the court is to reach
even the threshold of success.

The student council has ade
their suggestions for next year’s court
(see page one). The DAVIDSONIAN
would like to recommend the follow-
ing regulations for next year.

1) The Freshmen will be required
to wear hats

2) The Freshmen will be required
to wear name tags.

3) The Freshmen will not walk on
the grass.

4) The Freshmen will speak to all,
upperclassmen and faculty members.

The DAVIDSONIAN feels that the
regulations should be continued no
longer than one month. Also, we be-
lieve that the program should be ini-
tiated before the beginning of rush
week when the first upperclassmen
officially register.

It is our opinion that if the court
is to have any meaning to either
freshmen or upperclassmen, it must
be conducted in some form in chapel.
As with every student organization,
student support or lack of it will mean
the success or failure of next year’s
court.

Brains, Brawn:
ARepeat Request

Because of widespread student ap-
proval of last week’s suggestions, the
DAVIDSONIAN makes the following
proposals:

1. That the gym be opened from
2:00 until 5:00 p.m. on Sunday after-
noons.

2. That the gym be opened from
7:00 until 10:00 p.m. on Monday
through Friday nights.

It also seems that this is a good
chance to provide much needed stu-
dent jobs on the campus.

Entered as Second Class Matter at the Post Office at Davidson, North Carolina,
under Act of March 3, 1879.

With exams close at hand, The
DAVIDSONIAN asks that these pro-
posals be given immediate considera-
tion. There comes, after long periods
of study, a fatigue which can be best
combatted by a workout which leaves
the student fresh to return to the
books, not hazy after a nap.

We are sure that such a move to
open the gym for student conveni-
ence, only on an experimental basis,
would meet with widespread student
approval and appreciation.

Local Culture

During the last exhibition of
paintings in the foyer of Chambers,
one print was defaced with fountain
pen ink. Luckjly the print was pro-
tected by a clear plastic cover, and
the inkings were removed without
damage to the canvas. The pen im-
pressions still remained, however, and
the Fine Arts Department felt it had
to buy the print, which was priced at
fifteen dollars.

The amount of this needless van-
dalism has decreased considerably in
the past few years, but every now and
then it crops up again. It is amazing
to us that some student feels that his
skill and prowess as an artist are |
worth the price of an exhibited print.
It also makes us wonder about the ma-
turity of the “college man.”

The would-be artist could have
picked another painting, however. Al-
so on exhibition was a five hundred
dollar Rembrandt.

A Word
To The Wise...

While browsing through the li-
brary we came across a little item
which, while not of major import, is
rather amusing.

In the Charter and By-Laws of the
Trustees of Davidson College (with
revisions to February 19, 1958) Sec-
tion 7 states, “It shall be unlawful for
any person to set up or continue any
gaming or billard table, or any device
whatsoever for playing at any game
of chance or hazard, by whatever
name called or to exhibit any sleight
of hand...”

For the sake of good relations (we
do need office space somewhere),
we're not going to throw any rocks
even in the general direction of the
Union, don’t see any need to. And
as long as the Union doesn’t put any
more red light-bulbs on the front
porch, we think they're safe. MA

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR:

Irate Writers Hit Laundry,
Scold ‘Davidsonian’ Editors

Tom Mainor

Dear Editor:

This letter is about a year
overdue. However, I would like
to take this opportunity to pro
test the Davidson College laun-
dry’s replacing new shirts with
old.

1 would be most happy to
donate a few old shirts with
buttons still remaining; per-
haps those may be ruined,
rather than newer ones which
now seem sure to go in the
next few weeks.

It seems to me that quality
work is sadly lacking in our
laundry. Although our patroni-
zation of this place of business
is more or less involuntary, I
can see no excuse for such con-
sistently poor work and care-
Jess handling. We are still eus-
tomers.

Tom Mainor

Floyd Walters

Dear Editor:

A recent experience has had
a rather disquieting effect on
my confidence in our renowned
Davidson College laundry.

Operating under school
subsidization and a thirty-five
dollar contribution from each
student every semester, the
laundry need have no fear of
its business falling off; con-
sequently the laundry ap
pears to make a reguler prac-
tice of misplacing clothes and
and falsifying laundry tick-
ets.

On the morning of Monday,
April 27 I took by the laundry a
bundle of clothes including sev-
en pairs of khaki pants. On
Wednesday afternoon I re-
turned to the laundry to claim
the bundle; it lay unwrapped on
the counter, and on top of the
pile lay the ticket. Among the
items listed was the following:
“7 Pants (Duckj” fullowed by
a circled “1.”

Upon an inquiry to the. at-
tendant at the dry cleaning
counter, I learned that this
meant one pair of pants was
missing; the bundle could not
yet be taken.

On Thursday afternoon |
picked up my laundry; among

the items on the ticket was
one which read: “6 Pants
(Duck).” The numeral “7”
and the circle “1” were still
visible under the erasure.

IT am curious to learn what
is being done with these
clothes which have disappeared.
Perhaps unbeknownst to us
we are clothing the Davidson
Boy Scouts, or the orphans at
Barium Springs, or perhaps
some unfortunate refugees.

Let us bring this laudable en-
deavor to light. Until we are
enlightened, however, my
clothes will remain soiled and
uhdiminished in number.

Fred Morris

Dear Editor:

The Editorial Voice of David-
son College has grossly mis-
represented the _ financial
policies of the college in con-
nection with the fraternity
court funds.

This was done unwittingly,
perhaps, but it should definite-
ly be corrected. I believe this
college was as open as any you
will find about the finances for
this particular project, although
if it had known the extent to
which its information could
have been misinterpreted, it
might not have been quite so
open.

Saying that the “debt (on
the court), along with the five
per cent interest each year
on the amount still unpaid,
will be completely returned
in seventeen years” is an ab-
surdity. As anyone in Pro-
fessor Griffin’s investments

class will tell you, the col-

lege is not presently realizing
even its anticipated 41/2-5%
net return on the court.

Normal rental iavestments
(depending, of course, on the
market) expect about 11-12%
gross return in order that a
reasonable net return may be
expected after subtracting in-
surance premiums, -mainte-

nance, depreciation, taxes. and
custodial (e.g. landscaping) ex-
penses. The gross return ob-
tained by the college this year
was approximately 7%. It was
lucky if it netted 4%.

Even overlooking some

mathematical errors, there
were some unreasonable impli-
cations. Referring to “pure pro-

fit” being made by the college
seems ridiculous when you con-
sider the fact that the net re-
turn obtained goes directly to
operating expenses—thus less-
ening the load on the students.

The college is merely try-
ing to earn a substantial re-
turn on its investment of en-
dowment funds as it is legal-
‘ly and morally bound to do.
If this source of income stops
or declines, it simply means
that tuition and other stu-
dent fees will have to be
ralsed.

Hearing a student blast the
college for “having its cake and
eating it too’ implies that the
purpose of the college may he
separated from its obligation to
the student. The term “the col-
lege” includes the student, for
whose benefit the institution
exists.

When the business office
starts paying out dividends to
stockholders, but not before,
ean we start yelling about our
exploited situation.

THE HAWK’S NEST
"Under Influence’’
Rule Needs Review

By JACK TAYLOR

AS someone suggested, let’s consider the “under the
influence” regulation from a realistic standpoint. As the
Tule now stands, it serves to prevent ‘a student's returning
to the campus if he is overly intoxicated, i.e., intoxicated
to the extent of being obviously under the influence of
alcohol, despite efforts to “act sober.”

} g

Now, as I see it, the safest place for a man in such
a state is his dormitory room. Surely no one would sug-
gest that the highways, a road-side grill, or a strange
motel room is a safe refuge for a person who does not
possess complete control of his mental faculties or his
coordination.

WEAKEST MOMENT

Granted, students would be wiser not to get drunk,
but the fact remains that students do get drunk, occasion-
ally. Facing this fact realistically, would it not be better
for the student's safety to allow him to return to his
room quietly, rather than to force him amidst strangers
during his weakest moment?

Agreed, having intoxicated students staggering in

at all hours, singing and screaming of their recent ex- |

ploits, is not desirable. But, though he can hardly walk

to his 100m, a student who is under the influence is still ~

quite capable of silence.

A regulation which would impose severe restrictions
upon students guilty of creating a disturbance, especially
if the students were intoxicated, would serve very well
to discourage any unnecessary noise.

BROTHER'S KEEPER
Also, when the different aspects of the present reg-

ulation are considered realistically, we see that the rule
forces a student to choose between loyalty to friendship
and duty to authority. Loyalty demands that the stu-
dent help an inebriated friend back to the safety of his
room, and that he forget the meaning of the word duty.
This is usually the choice, for it is the more natural.
After all—we are our brother’s keeper.

_ Thus, it seems that a regulation which would allow
an intoxicated student to return to his room, but would
require that he do so quietly and immediately would be
a much more realistic and a much more desirable regu-
lation.

ELIMINATE HYPOCRISY
It would allow a drunk student the best and safest
place possible for one in such a condition as his; it would
eliminate the ambiguity and hypocrisy generated by the
present regulation.
