BCA, SIFs Clash In

By CAPTAIN AMERICA
and
BUCKY

AS you peons sit there con-
templating your summer jobs,
or worse yet, graduate schools
(your mistake) we try to
enlighten your befuddled min-
ds with tales of fun and frolic
that occur on the intramural
Pastures of this ignoble in-
Stitution.

For our third year now, we
are writing our last column,
completing yet another cycle
of senseless bullshit. Perhaps
tor this reason we are still
shackled to the seemingly ob-
scure title of contributors,
while others, who claim
knowledge supreme, write
their one-a-term column as
‘something or other’’ editor.
Yes, this means you Che.

Pressing onward we find
that as of last Wednesday
night, none of the spring in-
night none of the spring in-
tramural tournaments are
completed. A couple are close,
but that does not count, Bowie.
It is not as if there were a ton

w* beat the KA’s once and
knocked the tourney’s
darling, the Gozinyas (16-6)
into the losers bracket, to rest
until the finals.

The KA's picked their way
to the finals, behind the all-
around play of Grey Lindsey,
John Brandon and Bob Cun-
ningham. They beat Arcadia
13-3 and then took a forfeit
from the hungover Gozinyas,
who had burned themselves
out on Gozinya Day the day
before.

The KA's then crushed Q-12
13-3 to set up the winner-take-
all showdown.

In volleyball. there are two
teams left in the double
elimination tourney: the un-
defeated Banging Cannooners
Alumni #2 and the once beaten
Staten Island Fairies.

In the opening rounds,
Vanilla Fudge forfeited to
BCA#2, while the SPE’s han-
ded the SIF's their first
volleyball loss ever, in three
games.

down to a Thursday afternoon

means more to Cole than sim-
ply trying to win.

‘In a marathon,” he added,
“You compete with your own
time and not just compete
with other runners.”

Barksdale and Cole admire
the dedication of the runners
who usually finish first.

“You have to admire
someone like Dave Bedford
who runs something like 200 to
250 miles a week,”’ Cole ad-

mitted.

Cole believes that some run-
ners are so fanatical that they
practice running as a religion.
“Their whole lives revolve
around running,’”’ Cole ex-
plained.

Cole and Barksdale are not
this fanatical, for neither runs
more than 50 miles a week on
the average. However, their
efforts have perpetuated a
Davidson tradition and have
inscribed them into Davidson

history.

C-I has already reached the
finals by beating the
Gozinyas.

Now comes time to present

our annual spring awards in .

connection with IMAC sports.

First this year comes our
sentimental favorite, the eter-
nal flame of Davidson College,
“The Rag Man Award.” To
paraphrase a familiar line,
this year's winner, once again,
needs no introduction. He is
the one, the only John Duke
Sims.

Duke takes his third con-
secutive rag with him to
graduate study at Bagdhad
U., centering his efforts on the
art of self-discipline. Best of
luck, Duke, as we are retiring
your rag and bronzing it, to
hang from the Johnston Gym
ceiling as an inspiration to all
upcoming raggers.

Other nominees who had
flashes, but lacked the Duke’s
consistency, were Bill
Higgins. Frank Smith and
Chip ‘‘Phantom"’ Stone, who
was expert in the art of con-
descending rag.

One of the.most appropriate
awards given is the annual
‘Tron Glove Special.”
Replacing defending champ
Tom Soos, who couldn't mess-
up this year due to nagging
knee injuries, is the Mad Dog
himself of the all-inept Clap
team, Eric ‘‘Mash”’ Hendrix.
Mad Dog took over the ‘‘Hot
Spot’ for Clap, although no
one ever noticed he was there.

On good days his range was
a slow first step which was
usually in the wrong direction,
and if by some chance the ball
bad-hopped into his glove, his
marshmellow-constituted thr-
owing arm allowed such speed
demons as Dennis ‘‘Boog”’
Jones and Bob ‘‘beep-beep”’
Cunningham to reach second
base safely.

Why, Wasted even beat out a
one-hopper while on three
legs. It’s the spirit that counts,
though. And Mad Dog was
always in high spirits about
softball.

The most coveted award, the
James Piersall Award, goes
each year to the player most
typifying the neuroses of the
great Jimmy Piersall. It was
really tough to get a good
quality nut this year. But we
managed.

Also, to end things on a bad
note, the SPE’s, by entering
every team in every possible
sport, have won the point
totals in the IMAC, so they can
once again present them-
selves with their trophy from
SPE...er...ah...Phi Society.

Well, C.A. is going to play
with the Texas Armadillos of
the Central Texas
Professional Basketball
League or the CTPBL. (no
vowels).

So, he says, ‘‘Bye.”’

Y.B. is going to the I.M.A.
Bastard institution of higher
learning to pursue his doc-
torate in Humanities
(Chuckle, chuckle).

pitcher in IMAC who had to be
