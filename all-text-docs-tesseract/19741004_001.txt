ends Members Claim Low Salaries

By CHARLIE SHEPHERD
Senior News Editor.

“In the selection of
teachers, (Davidson) must
seek individuals of genuine
Spirituality who are out-
standing intellectually, who
have the best training
available in their fields of
study, and whose interest in
the students and in teaching is
unfeigned and profound. It
must also provide these
‘teachers with the time and op-
portunity for creative scholar-
ship which is fundamental to
the best teaching.”’

--from Statement of Purpose

Last year Davidson finished
“in the black,” and _ total
giving reached almost $3
million by the end of the fiscal
year. However, serious finan-
cial troubles are predicted for
the years ‘ahead by several
sources. Faculty salaries and
compensation are becoming a
tender area at Davidson now.

In average compensation,
the college paid its professors
$23,100; its associate
‘professurs’ $18,100; its
assistants $14,600; and its in-
structors $12,600 over the
previous year. :

These figures are
misleading, however, because
faculty compensation includes
more than the straight salary
that makes up the bulk of
week-to-week income.

The previous figures were
taken from a June 1974 report
by the American Association
of University Professors
(AAUP).

Professor of Religion David
Kaylor commented that the-
AAUP figures are about $3000
off the mark when straight
salaries are being considered.
Faculty, compensation in-
cludes Social Security, tuition
for faculty’ children, life in-
surance, and retirement pay.

' In ‘addition to inflation. or
perhaps partly because of it,
the college. enrollment boom
of the 1960’s is slowing to a
halt. ‘‘In the Sixties
enrollments were rising at 9
percent a year; in the early
Seventies the increase drop-
ped to below 5 percent. This
fall if will probably not exceed
3 percent,” the September
15th issue. of Forbes
Magazine emphasized.
Inflation and decreased

college enrollments are two
problems that are giving
Cuueyes serious financial
trouble, and part of the pinch
seems to be in the area of
faculty compensation. The
June 1974 “AAUP Bulletin’
writes, ‘‘In 1973-1974, for the
first time in the history of the
survey of faculty com-
pensation, the nation’s
faculties actually lost ground
economically.’’

MACCORMAC

Davidson may not be having:
enrollment problems at the

moment, but Kaylor and

Professor of Philosophy Earl

MacCormac are concerned
about Davidson’s financial
future. MacCormac com-
mented, ‘‘Davidson needs a
concerted effort to raise at
least $50 million in ten years.

“The only answer to present
and future financial problems
is effective fund raising,
primarily by the president and
his fund-raising staff,’’ he ad-
ded.

MacCormac said that, as far

as he know8, no plans for such
a fund-raising project exists.
He added that $35 million
should go to faculty en-
dowment and $15 million
should be used for buildings.
Kaylor echoed Mac-
Cormac’s sentiments. ‘If you

project our present fund- —

raising over the next ten
years, we need to double our
endowment. We’re not even
close to that in terms of
current fund-raising.’’
MacCormac warned that if
fund-faising is not intensified,
the. faculty may be forced to
unionize. ‘‘The faculty here is
generally conservative and
will not take such measures
soon,’’ he added.
» College President Samuel
R. Spencer Jr. criticized Mac-

~€ermac’s ideas about fund-~

raising, but admitted that the
coming years will be finan-

. cially difficult ones for David-

son.

“I think some development
people talk in rather gran-
diose terms. Certainly we will
have to have a strong fund
program over the next ten
years. .

“It’s going to be very dif-

‘ficult for any private college

to keep pace, but faculty
salary increases will be a first
priority item. This
something of definite concern

to the trustees and me, too,”
en said.

When asked if any plans are
underway for an intensified

is .

fund-faising program, he men-
tioned the $3 million that was
raised last year and said that
finances will be discussed at
the meeting of the Board of
Trustees late this month.
Spencer added, “The basic
thing to fund raising is making
the college worth raising
funds for. In a way, every-
thing I do is fund-raising.”

‘MacCormac sees an: in-
tensified fund-raising
program as one of the few
- directions the college can go to
ease its financial problems
and to increase faculty and
staff salaries. Spencer sai¢c
that the trustees are likely t
~ approve an increase in stude ¢
tuition for next year, but M :
Cormac believes that if Da: 2
son continues to raise tui on,
it will price itself out c the
market.

According to ‘‘Forbes,”’
small colleges across the
nation’ have a_ similar
problém. “What everybody
worries about is pricing your-
self out of a particular
market. We’re not terribly
worried about the bottom of
the market, and we’re cer-
tainly not priced out at the top.
The real problem is the people
in between,’’ said Bowdoin’s
Howell.

&

need, according to Mac-
Cormac. ‘We’ve dropped a

tremendous: amount in the .

stock market over the past
year,” he commented.

The problem of faculty com-
pensation is a complex one ‘by
itself even if some balance is
found for straight faculty
salaries. One of the major
ways the trustees analyze
faculty compensation is by
comparing Davidson com-

ensation with that of other
srivate colleges.

Davidson is generally com-
pared scholastically to schools
like Amherst, Haverford,
Swarthmore, ete. MacCormac
asserts’ that Davidson faculty
compensations are inferior to

“many of these schools.

Spencer disagreed with
MacCormac, indicating that
Davidson is about equal or
better in this area when com-
pared to these schools.

Figures comparing schools
are inconclusive because each
‘survey tends to rate colleges
by different criteria and
draws conflicting conclusions:
Also the finances required for
a professor to live in one part
of the country may vary a
great deal from the amount of
money that person needs to
live in another region.

Non-Credit Courses

By ANDREW LAMAS
Senior News Editor

The Co-Curricular Program
provides interested students,
faculty and community mem-
bers with the opportunity. of
pursuing non-curriculum
courses outside of the regular
college on a non-graded, non-
credit basis.

Complementing Davidson’s
regular curriculum, the Co-
Curriculum Program adds
flexibility and diversity to the. .
college’s educational en-
vironment.

Also, such a program allows
its participants to pursue their
interests in both practical and
academic areas without the
usual academic pressure, and
competition. :

Instructors have _ been.
secured, thus far, for three
courses. Earl W. Lawrimore
has volunteered to instruct

students in photography. Rory

Crawford, will teach guitar
lessons. Ginny Newell has -of-
fered to assist in the in-
struction of pottery-making.
The procedure for starting
or participating in a course is
uncomplicated. A student or
faculty member simply ex-

‘presses to the Co-Curriculum

Board his or her interests.
Board members may be con-
tacted between regular class
periods in the Chambers
Buiiding lobby.

The Board -will publicize
campus-wide all suggested
courses, in order to attract
other persons with similar in-
terests. Beene coi

Auto mechanics, typing,
guitar lessons, instruction in

cooking and yoga have at-
tracted the most interest

among students.
: Other courses which have
been suggested are:

American Civil Liberties,

Davidson’s scholastic peers.
The average faculty com-
pensation figures are taken
from the recent study done by
the AAUP. It should be noted
that Wesleyan, Bowdoin,

Oberlin, Occidental and Reed
offer a restricted range of
graduaté programs whereas
all others listed offer only a
bachelor’s degree. .

The important questions

‘SPENCER

remain: Are faculty salaries
sufficient to endure rising
costs and competition with
higher wages in other areas of
the population? Can Davidson
afford to hire high quality
professors, thereby helping

_maintain its past academic

standing?
