Senate Inaction Kills
Hopes For Approval

Of ‘Bill Of Rights’

AN ANALYSIS
By GRAY WILSON

Asst. Managing Editor

It appears that action on
the ill-starred Student Bill of
Rights has died this year in
the Senate, and a move to
add it to the SGA Constitution
will not be realized until next
year.

When the faculty ratified
the SGA _ Constitution last
year, Article III, of the Bill
of Rights, was tabled by ob-
jections to certain passages,
and the situation has yet to
be reconciled.

The bill includes several
proposals centering around
personal freedoms which re-
late to the academic and
non-academic life of the stu-
dent.

Reservations among some
faculty members over contro-
versial or ambiguous sections
delayed consideration until
last fall, but the Senate pass-
ed over the problem to push
other proposals.

With the new administra-
tion, work on the bill was re-
vived under a Senate com-
mittee staffed by Cliff Duke,
Alan Peterson, and Bob Ed-
monds,

Duke, who heads the com-
mittee, explains that the in-
tent this year was ‘‘to sound

faculty opinion to see if some |

of the initial objections raised
could he resolved.”

He said the bill had also
suffered this year because
the senate had concentrat-
ed its efforts in other areas.

The first impasse arose
over refusal by the faculty
to allow student membership
on a committee which arbi-
trates matters concerning
unfair grading.

Duke stated that his com-
mittee would recommend the
withdrawal of this particu-
lar item’ because the faculty
had warranted student trust.

A second objection con-
cerns the accessibility of stu-
dent academic records. The
section is misleading, but
records are open to anyone
on request at present.

Duke said the passage
would be modified to give
the student immunity in cases
where the college is not in-
volved and to notify him in
advance if his record is to
be checked for academic rea-
sons.

“The wording is vague and
ambiguous, and some guide-
lines need to be provided.”

The last reservation deals
with a section which forbids
a professor from disclosing
political beliefs or activities

SGA Study Seeks Change

For Laundry, Union, Store

By JEFF ALLENDER
Staff Writer

An SGA Senate committee
has recommended some chan-
ges.in the operation and pol-
icies of the College Union,
the Student Store and the
laundry.

The committee, composed
of Cecil Burney, Charlie Ral-
ston and Gerry Bello sought
to find out “where the money
is going” and to find any
places where services could
be improved.

LAUNDRY
‘Basically, we find that
the policy which Manager
C. W. Stacks relates to us
regarding laundry services
rendered is basically sound.
“He says that it is the

Library
Adds One
To Staff

Miss Jane Williams, a ref-
erence librarian at the Pub-
lic Library of Charlotte and
Mecklenburg County, will be-
come head of the serials
department of the Davidson
library August 1.

Her job will include re-
sponsibilities for the library's
periodical and government
documents holdings, accord-
ing to Chalmers G. David-
son, director of the library.

Miss Williams graduated
from East Mecklenburg High
School in 1962, Pfeiffer Col-
lege in 1966, and received
her M. S. in Library Science
from UNC-Chapel Hill in
1967.

policy of the laundry to try
to reduce the potential for
shrinkage, to add buttons
where buttons became crack-
ed or disintegrated, to press
washed pants for free, and
to do anything else that is
possible to provide any ser-
vice which he can within the
limits of the. general laun-
dry budget.

“Although we agree with
this policy, we are not con-
vinced that, in practice, the
policy is fulfilled. We note
that there are too many com-
plaints about faundry loss
and damage done to items
in the laundry.

“We have also considered
the laundry fee which is cur-
rently charged. Next year the
laundry fee will rise again.

“Stacks mentioned that per-
haps the laundry could dis-
continue its wash-dry-fold
operation
cdin-operated machines were
made available on campus.

“Such an installation would
cost the college, he estimates,
$25,000 in initial expenditures.

“Under such a system, the
Jaundry would be able to
cut back its personnel and
offer shirt, sheet, and dry
cleaning services.”

The committee recommend-
“ed:

“A formal
policy regarding garment
loss and damage be made
jointly by the business office
and the laundry manager in
order to clarify the circum-
stances under which custom-
ers gf the laundry will be
given, refunds.

“Studies should be continu-
ed by the Business Office
and the SGA Senate regard-

BOOKSTORE

“‘Last year, a committee
was appointed by the Presi-
dent composed of Professors
Brinkley, Williams, Abbott,
Bliss and otwo students to
review operations in the
bookstore. Their recommen-
dation was that the book-

store expand significantly
(10,000. new titles) immedi
ately.

“Two ex-officio members
of the committee, Peter Nic-
holls and Robert Stephen-
son (of the business office),
wrote a minority report in
which they said that such a
move was impossible because
of space, staff problems, etc.

“The minority report was
accepted by the President,
and a gradual phasing pro-
gram was instituted. 1000
new titles were to be added
this year.

“Next year, Nicholls has
requested three more book-
shelves and a_ work-study
student to work on addition
of titles alone.

“He cites a lack of room
as a major impediment to
more rapid expansion.

“He states that the pool
tables, owned -by the Union
and operated by the store,
take up too much room.

“Taller shelving has been
rejected because  surveill-
ance is needed to ward off
shoplifters.

“We are concerned that
the expansion of the book-
store is going too slowly. We
recommend:

“The cash register be mov-
ed closer to one of the doors
opposite the cafeteria, and
the door on the side df Jack-
son Court and the other door
opposite the cafeteria be
locked permanently. This
would decrease shoplifting.

“The Union is requested
te remove the pool tables
from the store to some other
suitable place as soon as
possible.

Another concem of the com-
mittee, Bello said, was
the possibility that the prof-
its of the store be returned
to the students in terms of a
discount or rebate.

The store shows a profit
of $8,000 a year, mostly from
“‘mug and beanie” sales.

STUDENT UNION

“We find the operation of
the. Union and the cafetéria
to be relatively obscure from
student view.

Initial difficulty was en-
countered » in obtaining in-
formation, without some coer-
cion, from, C. Shaw Smith,
and the figures we have on
the cafeteria are almost un-

intelligible.

“We are particularly con-
cerned that the Social fee
and programs fee be admin-
istered responsibily with ‘stu-
dent representation that is
free of control By anyone
other than students.

:‘‘We recommend that all
meetings of the Union Board
and Social Council be open
and that the records of all
Union expenditures be avail-
able to all students.

of a student in or out of the
classroom.

The passage is to be revised
to permit the faculty to be
open in cases involving com-
mon knowledge of a student’s
activities or beliefs. Other-
wise, the ideas expressed by
a student directly to the pro-
fessor are to be in full confi-
dence.

Thus the student would be
free to express any ideas to
his professor on political mat-
ters: in full confidence.

Eyewitness At Kent State Warns

People Respond Through Fears.

By STEPHEN ROADY
Associate Editor

Richard Taylor, head of
the graduate: studies _pro-
gram in political science at
Kent State University, told
a packed Morrison Room au-
dience Monday. night that
people today ae reacting
not to reality but to sym-
bols.

Taylor, an eye witness to
the shootings at Kent, stated
that there are two. popular
illusions relevant to the tra-
gedy at Kent State.

The first, he said, is the
idea that we live in a world
in which there is.a necessary
relation between causes and
effects.

He illustrated the absurdity
of this belief by referring to
Allison Krause and Bill
Schroeder, two completely
innocent students killed at
Kent State.

The second illusion men-
tioned by Taylor concérned
the idea that power controls.
In reference to the South-
east Asian situation, Taylor
queried ‘‘since when has U.
S. power resulted in any kind
of control?”

Taylor argued that in order
for student responses—to be
effective in light of this dis-
integration in communica-

tion ‘‘meanings have to be,
built upon the relationships
established between human
beings.” j

“Involve yourself in politi-
cal action,” he said. ‘‘This
isn’t a Something that you
do this summer, or hopeful-
ly for two weeks this fall.
It’s an ongoing thing.”

He added that students
should direct their cam-
paign toward the focal

point of the problem — the
Congress and the Admin-
istration.

“T have great faith that the
students can turn the polit.
ical situation around. It is
desperately important for
students to do this,” \he said.

“Some peopte ‘say, “this is
working within the system,’
but I’m not talking about
systems,” continued Taylor.

ToSpeak Tuesday

Brooks Hays, director of the
Ecumenical Institute of Wake
Forest University and a for-

in the Morrison Room next
Tuesday at 10 a.m. and 2
p.m.

Hays served continuously

Freshman Camp Dropped
From Orientation Plan

Freshman camp, part of
Davidson's freshman orienta-
tion program for «almost
twenty years, will not take
place next year.

The decision to drop the
camp was recently taken by
the YMCA, the organization
which has sponsored it in the
past. Spokesmen for the Y
said their organization will

‘Murder’
Begins

Monday

The Davidson Community
Players will present T. S.
Eliot’s ‘Murder in the Ca-
thedral” Monday through
Wednesday. The production
will be at 8:15 each evening
in St. Alban’s Episcopal
Church on Lorimer Road.

The Davidson Community
Players production is direc-
ted by Assistant Professor of
German..Hansford F. Epes,
and designed by Terry Hirst.

It features music composed |

for Eliot's drama by Asso-
ciate Professor “of Music
Wilmer H. Welsh. Z

The role ‘of Thomas is
played by Bob Manning, as-
sistant professor of physics.
Members of the chorus, whose
reaction to Thomas’ murder
is of particular importance,
are Scotty Nicholls, Nancy
MacCormac, and Ann Ma-
loney.

The tempters, who are “also
Thomas’ murders, are played
by Terry Hirst, Dick LeVan,
John Cox, and Jack Scott,
all Davidson ‘students. The
priests are played by Steve
Culbertson, Steve _Erland-
son, and David Grant.

Players, an amateur group
composed of members of the
Davidson community, was
organized in 1965.

work through tle regular
orientation program to
achieve the goals of the
camp.

“We decided to drop camp
because we felt that most of
the things accomplished there
could be accomplished here
on campus,” said Scott Wood-
mansee, college chaplain.

“Secondly, we thought that
camp unnecessarily under-
mined the regular ofienta-
tion program.”

. Greg Scott, president of
the YMCA, agreed with Wood-
mansee, noting that, “‘Camp
was more inspiring and more
fun than orientation. When
the freshman returned to the
campus and more mundane
things were presented to
him, it caused a letdown.

“We have tried, in the past

several years, to tie camp
more closely to the regular
orientation program,” Scott
continued. ‘In doing this, we
discovered that the two pro-
grams could be united with-
out much difficulty.”

“Camp had two main
goals,” said Scott, ‘to
challenge the [freshman to
make the most of his col-
lege experience and to al-
low the entire entering stu-
dents to have informal en-
counters among themselves
before settling down on their
halls.

“I am sure that orientation
can fulfill the first goal; I
hope it can fulfill the second.”

Both Scott and Woodman-
see, agreed that the Y would
take an active part in the
orientation program.

Born in 1898 in Arkansas,
he studied at the University
of Arkansas and received his
law degree from George
Washington University.

After his terms in Congress,
he was named a director of
the Tennessee Valley Author-
ity, and in 1961 Presidént
Kennedy named hiin ‘Astis-
tant Secretary of State ‘and
later Special. Assistant:to fq the
President. eee ul

He has_ been active in
many social ‘causes, particu-
larly in improving education-
al and economic opportuni-
ties for Negroes in the South.
His anti-segregation stand in
the Little Rock School crisis
reportedly cost him re-elec-

tion.

ing new values within the
system. This is very difficult
in a society which is in rap-
id transition, This is the

challenge — and action has
to start now.”
But he added that “‘the

retreat into violence is a
cop-out. It is an approval
of things as they are, be-
Cause you are then saying
that you agree with the ex-
istittg forms, only that you
want your people in power.”

In response to questions
after his talk, Taylor com-
mented that as far as he
could tell, the National
Guard at Kent State was
subjected to nothing more
violent than vile language
and several thrown rocks.

He was standing approxi-
mately two hundred yards
away when the shooting be-
gan, and he observed that
he had heard no shots until
the National Guard opened:
fire.
