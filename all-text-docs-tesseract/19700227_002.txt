Hardly Fair :

If you missed both ‘Face the Na-
tion” last week and the “Charlotte
Observer’ editorial concerning it, you
missed one of the most alarming opin-
ions of recent years to be expressed
by a public official.

On the show, Senator John Sten-
nis, D-Miss., was commenting on the
recently concluded trial of the “Chica-
go Seven.” He said that he considered
the trial a disgrace, and we can only
agree. He also said the proceedings
were an attack on the judicial system,
and again we must agree with him.

It was then that Senator Stennis
made the incredible suggestion. that
perhaps the answer to such attacks
on the system would be a constitution-
al amendment to eliminate the right
of trial in certain cases

We find ft hard to believe that Sen-
ator Stennis was completely serious
when he made the statement. The
Chicago trial if it has demonstrated
anything has shown that the right to
a fair and open trial is already too
abused in certain instances,

But let us consider the phrase
“fair trial.’’ Do we really have that

right? In the real world, i.e., outside
Davidson, chances still seem pretty
good although the actions of Judge
Julius Hoffman have raised doubts
in many minds.

In the world of Davidson, there are
also doubts. The letter by Normaa
Cary and the joint letter by Peter
Hobbie, “Mark Meza and Cary Tucker
concerning fhe recent Honor Court
decision prove that.

We see the next move as up to the
administration. Are the charges in
the letters accurate? Or are the in-
stances cited merely the results of
some fantastic and entirely unimagin-
able coincidences?

Can the students have faith that
they will receive a fair deal at the
hands of their own courts?.-Or are
they within reason when they. feel
threatened by the very existance of
those courts?

The acquittal by the Court of Ap
peals’ is encouraging. However stu-
dents must not fail to realize that the
real problems in the courts, still re-
main.

A Changing Role

In the February 21 “Saturday Re-
view” Henry Steele Commager has
written an extensive article express-
ing his views on the subject, ‘‘Has the
Small College a Future?”

In it he examines the origins of the-
small college as well as their present
condition, and one of the most vital
conclusions he reaches concerns the
college experience as a period of de-
laying in the development of the stu-
dent.

Commager explains that the college
grew up in America because the peo-
ple were not at first organized to pro-
duce universities on the European
model.

He states that the colleges original-
ly served much younger men than they
do today and therefore ‘took on the
functions of training the youths in
character and Christian morality.

The college’s role became one of
-prolonging youth. Commager descri-
bes the old college experience as four
golden years in which the student
could get learning, morality, manners
and perhaps a mate.

But today this role of college has
become a myth. Colleges are no long-
er for the elite but for everyone and
their traditional roles are usurped at
both ends of the college experience.

From below greater student matur-
ity, improving secondary education
and the junior colleges infringe on the
old college role of protection for the
student allowing him to develop away
froin societal pressures.

From above graduate centers, busi-
ness and the military are pressing on
the student to get out into the world
sooner. ,

Commager therefore rightfully con-
cludes that the colleges should get
out of the business of extending youth.
The role of training students for ‘an

introduction to life should be left to

the elementary and high schools, the
home, the church and society.

For the future Commager has sev-
eral recomendations. He would ‘see
the college speed up education, -
haps to three years. He sees abandon-
ing the old college concern with gov-
erning student morality and*provid-
ing a multitude of services to the stu-
dents so that they never develop com-
petence in providing these things for
themselves. He also calls for more
student involvement in the life-of the
college and the community.

Finally he deals with the geographi-
cally isolated and basically ‘rural’
colleges. Colleges isolated from cen-
ters of culture should keep a ‘gulf
stream’ of intellectual activity going
through the campus, he says. They
should always. keep before the young
the “spectacle of greatness and dedi-
cation.”

How does Davidson stack up against
these judgments? A reading of the
statement of purpose in the catologue
shows too many of the aims of, the
college to be those Commager is re-
gretting.

The Davidson program too often
fails to challenge the students with
roles significantly correlated to pos-
sible roles in their post-graduate life.

Psychologists recognize that such
a lack of challenge can serve to main-
tain the student in the life patterns
to which he is accustomed. In short;
the student’s youth is unduly pro-
longed. .

_As Davidson is now.in. its “decade
of destiny” and especially this year
considering its functions as never be-
fore, it is right that it should consider
its broad impact on the development
of the student.

Perhaps the answer would be to be
less concerned with doing things for
the student and more concerned with
doing things with him.

Of Missing Books

Each fall, the library takes a com-
plete inventory of its material. Kach
fall, the library discovers that be-
tween 250 and 300 books are missing
and unaccounted for. The disappear-
ance of these books costs the library
approximately 3000 dollars annually.

Often, many of these missing books
mysteriously re-appear in various
corners of the library as the school
session progresses. This year, how-
ever, despite the publication of a

complete list of missing materials, \

the library director reports that very
few books have been recovered.
There appear to be two possible
explanations for the present situation,
both of which are given some weight
by the library staff. The first. is that
some of the missing materials have
been taken by persons not affiliated
in any way with Davidson College.
The second is that the College-affil-

B.C.’

iated. offenders are less repentant
than is customary.

‘It seems a strange perversion of
the quest for knowledge that the very
seekers themselves should prove guil-
ty of denying their fellows access to
material that would be helpful. along
the way. Surely academic responsibil-
ity must include. the unselfish shar-
ing of the College library resources.

Anyone who has seen the incon-
veniences posed by a closed-stack
library system realizes what a good

system we enjoy .here at open-stack

Davidson. The library staff still feels
that the institution of:security mea-
sures, such as closed stacks or a book-
check station, would be an affront
to the character of the Davidson Col-
lege community.

In the light of this year’s statistics,
we wonder how long they can be ex-
pected to continue to feel that way.

Student Doubts Honors College:
Mullen Defines Sophomore Slump

To the Editor:

There is a rumor going
around that next year a few
students at Davidson Col-
lege will be able to learn
something.

Before anyone gets alarm-
ed, let me hasten to point
out that there is a very) slim
chance of this. The basis
of this -rumor--is- that-fact
that plans are currently be-
ing made to establish an
Honors College at Davidson
next xear.

However, the whole thing
is still in committee right
now (Blue what?), and there
may be little chance for it
to escape.

All in all, the present sy-

It is questionable whether

A lawsuit contesting fed-

The decision on this case

‘_in—the—past—25—years.

The suit was filed in Hart-
ford against the state of
Connecticut, the U. S. gov-

colleges. The 15 citizens who
initiated this action hope
ultimately to bring a de-
cision by the Supreme Court
on the constitutionality of
giving any federal funds to
sectarian colleges and uni-
versities. :

Leo Pfeffer, chief coun-
sel for the plaintiff, stated
the intent of the lawsuit to
a federal panel in his clos-
ing remarks. ‘We seek a
national declaration of judg-
ment and a nationwide in-
junction.”

Edward Bennett Williams,
attorney for the defendant
Colleges, stressed the far-
reaching implications of rul-
ing federal funds to sec-
‘tarian colleges’ unconstitu-
tional. Citing from a long
list of federal financing now
existing in numerous church-

related colleges, Mr. Wil-
liams predicted ‘sweeping

funds to sectarian schools. —

The question of giving
funds to church colleges
first arose in the mid-1960's
with the passage of the
Higher Education Facilities
Act. Distinctions between
sectarian and non-sectarian
schools were vague, but it
was stipulated that none of
the grants were to finance
buildings used ‘‘for  sec-
terian jnstruction or as a
place for religious worship.’

The funds around which
this controversy centers
amounts to $1.5-million, and
they are to begused by four
Catholic colleges for the
erection of various bulidings
on campus.

The schools in question
are Fairfield and Sacred
Heart Universities, and Al-
bertus Magnus and Am-
hurst Colleges.

Intérest in the case has
been widespread, and the
federal district courtroom
has been packed during its
sessions. The verbal battle
between Mr. Williams, an
defense attorney,
and»Mr. Pfeffer, chief coun-
sel for the American Jewish
Congress, has _ heightened
the appeal of the case.

PERcept

By PAUL E. ROWLAND

But The Malady Lingers 0

According to Warner Brothers’ blurb on a new
album cover, Frank Zappa dissolved the Mothers of
Invention ‘sneering bitterly about the inability of
youngsters to recognize good rock music even when -
it comes up and bites them on the ass.” He may be
right, but his work on ‘Zapped’ is hardly that dramatic.
_ _ Poor ole Frank’s outrage is understandable in the
light of his group’s rejection by teeny-boppers of
America who didn’t buy enough records to support
him in style; but was he making
music for music or music for money?

If the latter were his objective,
Frank should have done his home-
work. He should have studied the
market and come up with a. product

slightly more salable.

The soul market was dominated by blacks, the
country market was dominated by hicks, and Frank

was neither.

Still there were several opportunities Frank might

have investigated.

Situation songs could have been exploited by
Frank. The number of variations on the basic forms
staggers the imagination and could have staggered

hapless Frank’s portfolio.

One starting point for the situation song is a con-

cept basic to American

mythology — The Girl God
mS : =

Frank missed out on a cute extension of the
GGMEM form by not getting in on the Girl God Made
For Me Who Died trend started by “Honey.” (with
touching foreshadowing in heartrending dities like
“Last Kiss”). Tough luck, Frank.

__ Another virtual gold mine Frank missed was the
Girl God Made For Me Whom I Left for Unknown
Reasons (cf. “By the Time I Get to Phoenix”) variation,
not to mention the Girl’ God Made For Me Who Left

Me for Unknown Reasons.

Folk and its derivatives offer Zappa another road
to riches, but this road is a tricky one to travel. In ad-
dition to singing certain selected standards, one must
produce “original’’. works spiced with appropriate
alliterations and melancholy terms, mixed with obscu-
rity enough to make the naive call it poetry or even
philosophy. Simon and Garfunkel are masters of the

technique.

__ trate S&G fans, withhold your attacks, and con-
sider: if they really believed the songs they sing, why
do they act as they do? Are they singing songs for

songs or songs for money?

Finally. Frank—could have- implemented his_psy-
chedelic choice differently.. He could have made his
cacophony recognizably different from everyone else’s.

The song is ended, but the malady lingers on.
