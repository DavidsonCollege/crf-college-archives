Preview of women’s basketball season

The women’s basketball team
faces a tougher schedule this year,
playing all Division I opponents
and a full conference schedule.

But coach John Filar feels his
squad is up to the challege and will
succeed despite the loss of several
top players from last sesaon,

“We don’t feel we can sneak
up on everybody anymore,” Filar
said. “Once we get our first confer-
ence win, there will be no longer
any doubt we can compete in the
conference.”

This is the first year that the
freshmen players won’t be relied
on heavily to contribute, but the
juniors must step up, Filar believes.

Everybody acknowledges that
Georgia Southern is the best team
in the league, but the middle of the
conference is pretty balanced, Fi-
lar feels that if the team can get
some strong performances from

key players, then Davidson will be
able to jump into that middle pack.
“This group has come bac
ready,” Filar said. “They are tight
and are very focused. They are
ready to start changing things.”

Wrestling team makes
strong performance

By Will Cobb

The wrestling team opened its
season at the 14th annual Pem-
broke State Invitational Saturday,
an open tournament with competi-
tors up to 35 years old.

But the Wildcats more than
held their own, getting several
strong performances from the
freshmen, in a competition they
usually do not do very well in.

“For our first tournament,”
coach Tom Oddosaid, “I don’tlike
this kind of tournament due to the
competition. We’ve never placed
before in this tournament. We did
exceedingly well.”

This week, however,
Davidson got strong efforts from
Barrett Rose, Jesse Kenner, Ben
Wall, Miller Carey, Andy Sterling
and Sean Harvey. Overall, every-
body was still competing on Satur-
day, something Davidson had
never done before.

Rose was just one match short

of placing, despite giving up as
much as 50 pounds to his competi-
tion. Kenner finished fifth out of
32 wrestlers in his group, pining
two people before losing to the
defending champion in the semifi-
nals.

Wall was just one pont short
of advancing. Carey lost his match
in overtime. And co-captain
Harvey won twice in the consola-
tion round. Derek XXX and Jared
Glick are the other captains.

“The freshmen guys see what
they need to work on,” Oddo said.
“The see college wrestling at a
tough level. Although its presesaon,
we need to work on details and
continue to adapt to college wres-
tling.” ;
Oddo also said the team
needed to continue to work oncon-
ditioning, but empasized he was
very pleased with the effort the
wrestlers gave in the opening meet
of the year.

The preseasn has gone quite
well for the Wildcats so far, and
the team has found itself much
deeper than it thought. “The girls
are practicing with a lot of inten-
sity because there are a lot of posi-

tions and playing time still up for
grabs,” Filar said. |

Despite a tough schedule and
many injuries, the Catsstill play
hard and are in contention in al-
most every game this year.
