ety to choose from. Poetry at one
level is very elitist and subliminal.
I think (naturally very biased),
that poetry is quintessential
amongst all art forms.

RAGAN: Really, I believe
that poetry is the highest art form,
too, and embodies all other art
forms. William Stafford, a well
known poet who lives and teaches
on the West Coast, says that the
best way to write a poem (he does
write something everyday) is to
wake up early in the morning and
to be receptive. And if you can get
yourself in that receptive frame of
mind, some sight or sound or
something will come to you and
that will trigger something else. It
may not be a finished poem but he
will have something out of his re-
corded stuff. And I think that’s
possible.

SEN: Talking about about re-
ceptivity, it is in a way tied up to
spontaneity. What happens nowa-
days, coming back to the 20th

_century framework, and typically
the 70s and the 80s, people just
don’t seem to have any time. In
fact their excuse for‘any action
(poetry being just one of them, if
at all) is that “we don’t have
time.”

RAGAN: I think you are’ ab-
solutely correct.

SEN: We talked about this
earlier, i.e. the ‘mood.’ But a lot
of poetry written nowadays is pur-
ely as a mode of giving vent to the
frustration, anxiety or distress.
When the people are happy they
cease writing... ..

RAGAN: I think the value of
poetry as a therapy is being recog-
nized. In contemporary’ psychia-
try, the therapeutic value of poetry
writing is used. But that’s not the
aim in itself, it is not the end result
of woting.a poem. You communi-
cate, and I think you've got to
communicate in some way or. the
other. Feeling and meaning is an
added dimension. The ‘mood’ is
the extra dimension in itself is ex-
tremely important. In your poems
you create a very strong mood and
that’s what gives your poems the
ultimate power and finnese.

SEN: Now more specifically
to your reason of being at David-
son College. Regarding the Ver-
een Bell Creative Writing Con-
test, I'd like you to offer your
comments and impressions as the
judge this year. -

RAGAN: I not in position to _
single out or talk about any writer
specifically, but considering all
the entries both prose and poetry,
it was very impressive, and I
thought the overall quality was re-
ally outstanding. It is difficult to
make a choice, and sometimes be-
tween first, second and third, and
even the honorable mentions the
line would be very narrow. It'll be
difficult for me to say why I chose
this one over another, but the

quality of the overall was excel-
lent.

One thing that struck me, not
just with the writing of students in
Davidson College, but which I’ve
seen in so many other contempo-
fary writers, the story or the poem
could take place anywhere, there

no sense of place, and maybe
that’s the reflection of our society

as a whole. We are a very mobile
society, we don’t belong any-
where. Maybe they are rootless
people or becoming rootless and
that does disturb me. And it could
be that I’m just old-fashioned, I do
like to know where I am and it
doesn’t have to be a poem about
great length, but a few words, a
line or two that replace me as a vi-
sual image of a place.

SEN: So in other words you

~do suggest that this is a sort of con-
tinuation of the “Absurd Move-
ment” in literature, or maybe a
glorified disintegration of the dis-
integrated?

RAGAN: I think it is just a re-
flection of the society as a whole
perhaps more than anything else.
But everything goes in cycles, we
move around and come to where
we were.

SEN: Professor Abbott, I
want to put you on the spot just for

the moment because he (Sam
Ragan) gave you a fantastic com-
pliment. We don’t have any writ-
ing program in Davidson. The
only and the much sought-after
writing course is English 171, and
ninety-five percent of the people
who figured in the list of winners
and honorable mentions were
from that class itself which is a
great reflection of the course it-
self. What do you feel as the only
teacher of creative writing?
Should there be a full-fledged
creative writing program? If so,
why, and what do you think of the
Students over the years and of
late?

ABBOTT: I don’t think at
Davidson College we should have
a “creative writing program.”
This is not a university, it is a lib-
eral arts college. people would
begin to major in one very narrow
area too quickly. That is not to say -
we shouldn’t have more courses in
writing. [Deally what Id like to
see is to have a beginning creative
writing course, and an advanced
poetry and fiction course in which
the students in the beginning
course would then decide after the
beginning course which direction
they would like to go. I would like
for us to have enough money to
bring in visiting distinguished
writers, perhaps in the spring to
teach an advanced course. I do
think that the majority of the stu-
dents would do very well with a
couple of more courses in creative
writing each term than they do
now. But I don’t need a whole.
program. I think our students have
done very well considering the
amount of time they spend on their
writing. The Vereen Bell prize
winners of 1984 and 1985 are both
studying at the University of lowa
Writers Workshop, which is the
best program in the country. And
I'd rather see people specializing
in Creative Writing at the graduate
level and get a good basic under-
graduate education. I think that
rather than a visiting writer who
comes for a day or two to do the
Vereen Bell prize, I would like to
see a Vereen Bell Professorship,
where a visiting writer probably
could come in for several weeks to
work with our students.

RAGAN: I would tend to
agree with that. I think probably
you would have somebody like
Tony Abbott create a good cli-
mate, a good atmosphere and that
is really all you can expect, be-
cause I am not sure how much you
can really teach in writing. But if
you can create a climate for
creativity then something will
happen. _

SEN: As a last question, what
do you have to say to the young
people who are desperate to write,
and- who write, and who want to
do something with their writing?

RAGAN: I think they oughtto .
write and ought to try to get it pub-
lished. That’s part of the business
of writing — to be published. I
would recommend when they’re
young that they commit them-
selves to serious writing. But if
they are going to write, they must
also be a reader. After-they’ve
written something, if it satisfies
them and they feel good about it,

they ought to try and enter it in
various competitions, and there
are more and more nowadays.
ABBOTT: There are an awful
lot of people who are writing now
who read. very little poetry, so
they don’t know anything about
what other people are doing. And

, one of the reasons people don’t get

published is because they do not
read. It’s really a two-way street.

RAGAN: I think if you have
to be a writer, you've got to be a
reader!

Burkhart examines causes of conflict
between women and men

By MICHELE E. MILLER

Women, have you ever been
raped? Men, have you ever raped
anyone?

Let’s rephrase the question for
amoment. Women, have you ever

“been forced to have sex against
your will? Men, have you ever
forced a woman to have sex with
you against her will?

If you answered yes to either
of the last two questions, you have
been involved in a rape, says clini-
cal psychologist and Auburm Pro-
fessor of Psychology Barry Bur-
khart. Burkhart spoke to a 100
plus crowd in the 900 Room on
Thursday night. His speech, enti-
tled “Sex and Agression: Not So
strange Bedfellows,” discussed
male and female attitudes towards
sex and aggression (what he calls
“America’s two favorite pas-
times”).

“Rape” is a loaded word. It
connotes violent sexual aggres-
sion that is incompatible with our
idea of intimate relations between
a man and a woman. Burkhart’s
first encounters with rape early in
his practice sparked an interest in
sexual aggression that has lead to
extensive research on the subject

of sexual assault. His first efforts —

were met with resistance; he was
frustrated in his attempt to gather
information on rape because it
simply did not exist. On of the
first books that he read on the sub-
ject, Susan Brown Miller’s
Against Our Will, raised some de-
gree of skepticism in his mind.

“Brown Miller suggests that
rape is a social mechanism. in-
tended to aid one class of people,
namely men, in imposing their
will on another class of people,
namely women. It is a method of
social control.

“Like a true psychologist, I
wanted empirical proof of this,
and the question I asked was, ‘If
this is a method of social control,
why doesn’t it -happen more
often?” he said. In-1974, the FBI
crime ‘statistics indicated that
45,000 rapes had been reported.
This amounts to one half of one.
percent of the population of
women (not a particularly telling
statistic).

Burkhart took his question
into his classroom at Auburn. He
asked his class, “Women, have
you ever been raped? Men, have
you ever raped a woman?” His
classroom returned results indi-
cating that zero percent of the men

admitted to having raped a woman
and that four percent of the
women admitted to being raped.
He asked himself, “Where, then,
are all these rapists coming
from?” He then rephrased the
question asking, “Have you ever
forced a woman to have sex with
you?” and “Have you ever had sex
against your will?”

The results from this question
were mind boggling; one in
twelve men admitted to have
forced sex upon a woman and one
in eight women admitted to hav-
ing sex against their will.

The Jegal definition of rape in
most states is carnal knowledge
(sexual penetration) with a
woman who is not your wife
against her will and without her
consent by means of force. The
men in his class denied that what
they had done was rape. |

His initial experiment was re-
plicated over and over, producing
the same results, that eight to ten
percent of men have engaged in
activity that could legally be de-
fined as rape and that twelve to

thirteen percent of women have.

been legally raped (an additional
12 percent have had non-consent-
ing intercourse that does not meet

the criteria for the legal definition
of rape). These statistics point to a
deep phenomenon in our society
that needs to be explored.

Burkhart says that initially, it
didn’t make sense to him that sex
was a vehicle for aggression. He
set out to understand why sexual
aggression was a normal part of
courtship, why aggression was a
“societal norm.” Societal norms,
according to Burkhart, are_ thie
“hidden hands of society.” Norms
guide your behavior so powerfully
that you, don’t even realize that
you are being controlled.

We are unaware of their power
over us. Men and women adhere
to two entirely different sets of
norms; norms are gender specific.
These two sets of norms serve to
disinhibit aggressiveness in males
and to inhibit negative response of
women to this aggressiveness.

Burkhart saw some dominant
norms in those men who admitted
to have forced sex upon a woman.

These men view sex as a valu-
able commodity by which they
purchase their masculinity. Sex
validates their manhood; it is a rite
of passage. A second expectation
‘is that men are in control, domin-
ant in relationships.

Therefore, not only is sex of
grave importance to masculinity, |
but it is also there to be taken. Bur-
khart relates a curious set of des-
cfiptions of women made by men:
“Men don’t like women. They see
women as sexual objects. Women
are bitches. Women are people

from whom you have to take

something from.”

Intimacy is intimidating for
everyone, especially for men.
Men have been taught to be tough.
There is a great deal of anxiety
about intimacy; men often hide
behind their hostility, refusing to
be vulnerable.

Womén, on the other hand,
are brought up to be nice. Bur-
khart says that the “nicer” women
are the more. susceptible they are
to being raped. He related a story
about-a rape victim who “thought
about screaming,” but she didn’t
want to “embarrass” her assailant.
Women are brought up to be
mothers. “While little boys are out
on the playground eating worms,
little girls are in helping the
teacher,” says Burkhart. Women
are often not able to communicate
their displeasure with sexual ac-
tions. They are unable to articu-
‘late their reluctance.
