Citadel Bulldogs Nip Wildcats In

Thrilling Thanksgiving Finale
The Davidson Wildcats dropped a close gnd_ hard-fought
vame to the Bulldogs of the Citadel Thanksgiving Day in Char-

lotte, 25-19. The lead changed

hands 3 times and was tied 3

two minutes of play to win and gain revenge ‘for last year’s
times before the Bulldogs broke loose with a score in the last

14 to 6 defeat by the Davidsonians.

The Wildcats, a 20 point under-
dog, opened the fireworks in the
first quarter as Johnny Richards,
defense’ center, intercepted a pass
and went 75 yards to score. Dick
Blanks kicked the extra point, and
the score stood, 7-0, but not for
long. Citadel roared back, covering
60 yards in 13 plays to score as
Chandler, a star for the Bulldogs
all afternoon, ran it over from the
seven yard line. Matthews’ kick
was good, and tthe score was tied,
7-7, A few minutes later, Citadel
scored again on an end-around
pass play from Brownlow to Chand-
ler, good for 33 yards, and a touch-
down, but the try for the extra
point was wide. The score was tied
up once more a few minutes be-
fore the half on a 56 yard David-
son march featuring 2 52-yard pass
play, Lambeth to Sifford, and a 4-
yard drive by Runyan. Blank’s try
for the extra point was blocked, and
the score at half was knotted, 13-13.

Citadel took. the kickoff in the
second half and went 61 yards on
12 plays as Curtis Bazeman went
over. Again the try for extra point
was wide. The score was tied once
more as Davidson pushed down the
field for a touchdown on a_ pass
from Lambeth to Brown. Black's
kick was blocked once more, and

the score stood 19-19. The Bullt-

dogs came back again to score, tak-
ing advantage of a short Davidson
punt and an interference ruling on
the 1 to score as Baldwin went
cover, The extra point try was wide,
and the scoring was over for the
day.

However, the last play of the

game brought both thrills and de-
spair. It came on a pass from Lam- |
beth to Price, who lateraled to
Brown, who in turn ie scdty |
scored. Howeve?, the field judge |
said Brown stepped out on the 3
yard line. It would have given the
improved Wildcats a tie and per-
haps a win had the touchdown been
good, but time ran out before the}
Davidsonians could run another
play.

Lambeth, playing one of his best
games of the season, completed 14
of 23 passes for 266 yards. Seniors
Brown and Price, who caught 9
passes for 246 yards between them,
Chandler, Richards, and Sharpe
concluded their college careers with
scintillating performances.

By JIM SMITH and MAC RICHARDS

Kappa Sigma 8; Phi Kappa Alpha 6/ The ‘irst downs were about even.

The Kappa Sigs kept their chance
of a tie for first place in fraternity
standing by turning back the Pika’s
8-6. Charlie Pearson’s passing com-
bined with Dave William’s catch-
ing was too much for the stubborn
Pikas. Williams caught several
nice passes and accounted for the
Kappa Sigma’s score. The two
points game when Bill Collins was
caught behind his goal. First downs
‘were greatly in favor of the Kappa
Sigs.

Pi Kappa Phi 6; Phi Delts 0

The Phi Delts were bested by a
much improved Pi Kappa Phi team
by score of 6-0. Billy Houck hit
Billy Cassels with a pass for the
winning touchdown, The game was
mainly a see-saw struggle with sev-
eral other scoring attempts being
stopped short. Phi Delts however
had the edge in first downs by 1.
“The game was the result of a tie
which had ended 6-6 with 4 first
downs each.

Kappa Sigma 6, Pi Kappa Phi 0

The Kappa Sigs had to fight for
a first place tie with the Beta’s for
the fraternity championship, but
they came through with a 6-0 win
over the Pi Kappa Phi team, Char-
ley Pearson accounted for the win-
ning touchdown by passing to
“Slick” Evans, Kappa Sigma had
lead in first downs by 6 to 3.

Phi Gams 12, Sigma Chi 0°

Pi Kappe 18, S.P.E. 6

The fast-improving Pi Kapp.
team crushed a game but outclass-
ed S.P.E,'s outfit for their second
straight victory by a big score. The
S.P,E.’s fought hard, but were nev-
er really in the ball-game, and so
ended up on the small. end of an
18-6 score. Leading the victéry pa-
rade were Billy Houck, Bill Cas-
sels, and Jerry Nall with one touch-
down apiece. ,

Phi Delts 6, Pikas 0

The Phi Delts racked up their,
sixth victory of the year by down-
ing the Pikas 6-0. Very cold weath-
er, better suited to basket-bull than
football, kept both teams from play-
ing at their best, and tuened this
into one of the dullest games of

es which swept to one touchdown,
and were a constant threat through-
out the rest of the game. However
the K.A,’s managed to run out the
clock to turn in the outstanding
upset of the year.

the current season. Norman White- |’

hart scored the lone touchdown.

Kappa Sigs 20, Campus Club 0

The Kappa Sigs turned !oose a
high scoring offense which raced
to 20 quick points against the hap-
less Campus Club in the first half.
That was adding insult to injury
as far as the Campus Club was con-
cerned, so they forfeited the game
after the first half.

K.A.’s 8, Betas 6

A hard fighting K. A. team stav-
ed off a-strong second half rally to
spoil the Beta’s undefeated season
by a small two point margin. Ear-
ly in the game the K.A,'s worked
the ball deep into Beta territory.
There it changed hands several
times, but never moved very far
from the Beta goal. Finally the
K.A.’s scored on g fourth down pass
to Stribling. The ensuing kick-off
went deep into the Beta end-zone,
when the Beta ball carrier tried to
run it out, a host of K.A.’s swarm-
ed on him for the safety, which
proved to be the winning margin.
The half soon ended with the score
K.A, 8, Beta 0. -

In the second half the Beta’s be-
gan to throw long desperation pass-
