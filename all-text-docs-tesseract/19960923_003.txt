Whatever happened to “Dorm Storm”?

Some departments are slow to respond to last spring’s Student Government survey

By JENNIFER STARR

Staff Writer

Last Spring, Davidson Col-
lege students had the opportunity
to give their opinion of Davidson
life through the SGA’s “Dorm
Storm” surveys. With the report
now out, the question is if the
“Storm” will make a difference.
Campus department heads recently

received the report with varying
reactions.
One problem that may limit
departmental response is the un-
scientific nature of the polling.
Senators polled students in a
variety of methods and wrote down
individual comments.
.. Senators then submitted sub-
jective reports to the SGA Polling
and Response.Committee, which

combined the data. According to
sophomore Jonathan Sipling, Chair
of the SGA Committee on Polling
and Response, “We pretty much
tried to include absolutely any-
thing. We only left out suggestions
that didn’t take the project seri-
ously.”

This process allowed creative
opinions to be aired.

However, it did not provide a

sense of student mandate for
change. Lack of information about
how many students hold a given
opinion may reduce the impact of
the report.

Sipling says, “I talked to Dean
{of Students Thomas] Shandley.
He seemed alittle bit hesitant since
we were not able to include hard
numbers.”

Some welcomed the report as

Students from the Sophomore and Junior
classes elected the new 1996 Honor Council mem-
bers last week in elections that began Monday and
carried over into run-offs the next day

Sixteen sophomores and ten juniors announced
their candidacy for Honor Council. Given strict
instructions by SGA Elections Council Chair John
Bell concerning the election process, Honor Coun-
cil Candidates may not campaign in any way for

election.

Junior Erica Thomas, new to the Honor Coun-
cil this year, is excited to be an active part of

Davidson’s tradition. “I have always had a
tremendous respect for the Honor Council and
I am very excited to be a part of something so
treasured and respected as the Honor Code. It
is a great honor to be a part of a group that
stands for the things for which the Honor Coun-
cil stands,” she says.

Sitting on the Honor Council has been
something that junior Jacob Darling has been
interested in since his freshman year. This year
was his third time running. “The Honor Code
is a huge part behind this college and I am
extremely flattered to be one of those chosen to
uphold such a tradition,” he says. :

an opportunity to receive student
input, even if they are not planning
to make any immediate changes as
a result of the report.

Director of Athletics James
Murphy says, “The feedback we
receive in surveys is important in-
formation.”

The SGA plans to hold sur-
veys periodically in the future to
garnish more student input.

SGA proposes
shuttle system

Buford: “As Cornelius
blossoms and more
social opportunities

exist, the necessity for

safe rides increases.”

By ANN HATFIELD
Staff Writer

Last Tuesday night, the SGA
agreed to form an Ad Hoc Com-
mittee to study students’ transpor-
tation needs. At the request of
numerous students, this commit-
tee will consider the feasiblity of a
shuttle system between Davidson,
Charlotte, and neighboring towns.

If members of the committee
determine that student demand
exists, they will study similar pro-
grams at peer-institutions and

“oversee the implementation of a
pilot. "

GA president Warren Buford
says that he sees the purpose of a
campus shuttle as twofold. It
should provide rides to “those who
don’t have a car” and provide “a
safe ride” to and from restaurants
and bars. He adds, “As Cornelius
blossoms and more social oppor-
tunities exist, the necessity for safe
rides increases:”

Buford reminds students that
the shuttle program is still in the
preliminary stages, but remains
optimistic about future possibili-
ties. He says, “I’d like to see a pilot
program up and running by the end
of the semester.” The transporta-
tion committee welcomes all stu-
dent suggestions and input.
