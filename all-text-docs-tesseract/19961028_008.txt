OPINIONS

MONDAY, OCTOBER 28, 1996

“No nation can rise to the
height of glory unless your women
are side by side with you.” These
inspirational words were spoken
by Quaidi-e-Azam, founder and
liberator of Pakistan on March 10,
1944. Contrary to Western femi-
nism and certain pundits on cam-
pus, this Western ideal is a Quaidi-
e-Azam reality for Pakistanis. Af-
ter reading the analysis of Ms.
Heller and Ms. Richardson, I have
come to the conclusion that
“Westernism’” and Islam don’t mix,
and quite frankly are complete
polarities. Accept it and move on.

Moreover, I am disgusted that
The Davidsonian has become an
arena for “Pakistan bashing” over
these past few weeks and contin-
ues to attempt to refute facts and
firsthand information. Let’s re-

name it, "The Oppressor: Paki- |

stan.” The real issue of the perse-
cution of woman has been trampled
on, and Pakistan and Islam have
been placed in its shoes. Interest-
- ingly enough, this is where the
ignorance lies and grows, not in
Fahd Gul or myself.

In Islam, a man cannot hand-
cuff a woman and take her to jail.
This is against the teachings of the
Quran and Sunna of the Prophet

(pbuh). Heller believes that men
have access to females detained in
cells. Islamic Law prohibits such
actions; and thus, woman con-
stables are assigned for that duty
alone. Civic regulations require
that policewomen be present in
station houses when women are
being questioned

Although Richardson claims
that Heller’s main argument was
to address the global oppression
of women, she sure went out of her
way to come up with some fic-
tional tales about women being
dragged in the city streets of Paki-

her weakness and paying the bill
exhibit’s your masculine superi-
ority. Heller states, "Perhaps Fahd
and Saad have not been made
aware of what really happens to
women in Pakistan.” Ironically,

there for a combined thirty-five

years, do not yet

SEPARATED. Hence, it is physi-
cally impossible to talk, touch,
harass, question, or even rape a
woman in detainment, without any
dire consequences. A jail or better
known as a thana is filled with a
throng of people waiting to be seen.
Getting a chance to meet the Head

task, and Heller claims that women

are raped under these circum-
stances. Let me give you an analo-
gous example: it would be like

and she even introduced the ever
popular “two finger test.”” What a
global treatise on the oppression
of women! Richardson also states
that giving up aseat in a bus or taxi
for a woman is not an act of re-
spect, but a manifestation
“androcentric notion of man’s
strength and woman’s weakness.”
In effect, she is telling the male
population of Davidson notto hold
open a door for a young woman,
because that manifests the notion
of man’s androcentric nature and
weakness of women. Hence, pull-

which attempted to make the pe-
nal Code of Pakistan more Is-

the closet? Quite strange? In a
country, supposedly, where
women are repressed and perse-
cuted, Benazir Bhutto began the
placement of a global funded pro-
gram to train and insert 33,000
female health care workers in ru-
ral areas (US State Dept. of Paki-
stan). Strange. Isn’t this the same
country that persecutes women
and then at that same time gives
them 33,000 jobs? Strange?

Spotlight on Pakistan: Week Five

. Inconclusion, I am not advo-
cating the idea that women are not
repressed, but I am audaciously as-
serting that "what and where,” one
reports repression should be thor-
oughly researched and backed up
with facts. One of my cousins lives
in Indonesia, that does not give me
or anyone else the authority to be-
come an Indonesian expert and start
publishing articles on the status of
the sewer systems in the metropoli-
tan region of Jakarta. If people truly
yearn to change the present state of
women in the world, then we should
end this cultural-religious discus-
sion against Pakistan and Islam and,
consequently, focus our attention
on women’s rights. I recommend
Ms. Heller and Ms. Richardson visit
Pakistani jails, via PIA, so that they
can get a firsthand orientation on
how things really work, rather than
relying on their imaginations and
Western newspapers. Recently, the
female warden of the women’s cell
at the Karachi Central Prison com-
pletely agreed with me and was
abhorred at the articles she saw. I
believe the credibility of a female
warden outweighs a fund-raiser for
a self-interest group. Don’t you?
Any future complaints should be
addressed to her, she will gladly

In Sabine Heller’s story blast-
ing Pakistan (published in The
Davidsonian on September 23,
1996), she offers bogus evidence
to support her article, apparently
trying to win favor for her pro-
posed major in Women’s studies.
She wanted her voice to be heard
and, in order to do so, she pro-
duced erroneous information. This
information tries to destroy the
reputation of Pakistan and has a
few subliminal attacks against the
Islamic religion. “75% of all the
women in Pakistan’ s jails are there

. because they were rape victims.
Once in custody, 72% of them are
raped again by members of the
police force,” Heller states. It is
understood that in magazines and
newspapers the sources of an ar-
ticle are usually omitted. How-
ever, in this case where such slan-
derous and unknown accusations
are made, it is imperative to in-
clude in the source where the in-
formation was taken from. But I
can imagine, Sabine, that it is hard
to list your imagination as a source.

The article defending Heller’s
story against the well warranted
attacks by Mr. Fahd Gul, Mr. Saad
Gul, Mr.Yasar Ishaq, and Mr.
Vinod Thomas (two of them Inter-
national Students from Pakistan)
is almost as asinine as Ms. Heller’s

she begins by saying “Defending

Heller as a front to. talk about
Pakistan. They were obviously

also says that by both writing,

How can Richardson say that
defending her is easy and then
offerno evidence to defend her?

She then continues by in-
cluding Pakistan as being in
the Middle East and then ex-
plains, “I am doing so for my
own purposes in this article. I

. more ignorant. Again that
makes just about as much sense
as her entire article.

Heller added an article to
The Davidsonian which was
published last week with
Richardson’s article. She says
that she was sad that her point
of women’s issues being prob-
lems was lost by the writers.

agree with this and I under-
stand why.” This is totally point-
less and out of place in a newspa-
per article (sort of like Heller’s
and Richardson’s articles being
published in The Davidsonian).
She then says that you don’t have
to go to Pakistan to understand
women’s struggle (both the Gul
brothers have spent over 17 years
each living in Pakistan). Instead,
she writes you can read the article
written by Saad Gul, saying that
women were reserved seats in the
front of the bus, causing men to
step off, because there isn’tenough
room forthe women.

Well, Kristen, this is a far cry

respect in quotations: “The ‘re-
spect’ given to women is as fol-
lows.” Does she not call this chiv-
alrous act of letting women sit
down respect? No, to her it is in
the same class as being raped,
“enforcing the androcentric no-
tion of man’s strength and
women’s weakness.” I guess I am
as bad as a rapist, Kristen, for I
frequently offer my seat on public
transportation buses to women
(which are usually accepted). She
concludes inferring that the Gul
brothers and Mr. Yasir Ishaq were
only trying to promote their coun-
try which was the reason for their

Since it was their country which
she spent the entire article blast-
ing, I could see why. Secondly,
she said that she had spoken to her
cousin who was active in the All
Pakistani Women’s Association.
This woman had visited jails and
had counseled rape victims; Heller
also says that this woman had spo-
ken to rape victims who had been
jailed after being raped. This sadly
may be so, mistakes happen as the
authors had’stated. It is possible
that the police had made mistakes

‘(like our police don’t make any

mistakes here), but where does the

respond to your inquiries.

Thirdly, Heller says that al-
though the jails are single sexed,
the possibility of guards raping fe-
male inmates isn’t precluded? Ob-
viously not, but would you mind
telling us where you got the infor-
mation that guards rape female rape
victims and also the information
that it happens to 72% of the popu-
lation?

She concludes by saying that
in order to get out of a women’s
prison you must go through a man’s
prison. She follows by saying that
“in reality, plenty of men have ac-

’ cess to these female prisoners.” Are

you telling us that the male prison-
ers are free to roam in the women’s
prisons and are given the keys to
“access” these female prisoners?”

A few final comments. I, like

-all four other writers defending Pa-

kistan, have spent some time in this
growing country and we have never
heard, seen, or even imagined such
atrocities.

If they did exist, don’t you
think that the government of Paki-
stan, which is by the democrati-
cally controlled by a woman who
was educated partly in the United
States, would have done something?

The United States wouldn’t
have sent troops or even had it’s
hungry media even say anything
about this?
