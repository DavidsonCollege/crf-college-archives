Cats Rally By Rugged Bulldogs, 73-69

By CHARLIE SLAGLE
Staff Writer

If someone had looked into
the Citadel locker room before
their game with Davidson, it
would not be surprising to see
their players running full
speed into the walls. This is
how the Citadel played Satur-
day and it was all the Cats
could do to salvage a 73-69 vic-
tory.

The young Bulldogs came
out scrapping, with a full court
press that caused many early
turnoversand gavethem a five
point lead 8-3. From then on
Davidson’s class told as they
did not fold as many other
teams had done in Charleston.

Citadel’s record at home
was a surprising 8-1 before the
game. Although the crowd was
small (less than 2,000) and not
right on the court as in some
other gyms, it was soon appa-
rent why the Bulldogs were so
successful at home.

In the early going, it was ap-
parent that the game was
going to be rough as Larry
Horowitz was undercut on two

drives. Neither of these two in-
cidents were called fouls.

The referees seemed to
ignore flagrant incidental con-
tact on both sides, and missed
some friendly gestures. One of
these was a game of elbows by
Arthur McGriff and Horowitz
which ended in McGriff's at-
tempt to punt the Wildcat for-
ward

Horowitz started off fast for
the Wildcats. After about four
minutes of play there was a
steady chant of Horowitz from
the Citadel rooting section
whenever Larry was in the

game.

Paul Wagner also played a
strong game and was the
recipient of some name-
calling by the raucous Bulldog
fans. He also was the victim
of some bad calls and non-
calls.

When Wagner first entered
the game, he put his hand on
the back of his man and was
immediately called for the
foul as the refs tried to regain
some measure of control.

Later he got a rebound un-

Wolfpack Tops Cats
As Little Men Shine

By MARK WILENSKY¥
Sports Editor

For the second straight
year, Davidson managed to
control David Thompson, and
for the second straight year
the Wolfpack of N.C. State has
come away with a lopsided
victory over the Cats.

Strong defense by Greg
Dunn and a tight zone defense
in the first half kept
under control, but his team-
mates were equal to the task
as the nation’s number two
ranked team breezed by
Davidson, 105-78.

The Cats jumped off to a 2-0
lead, but after that the out-
come was never in doubt. Led
by River's 24 points, the Wolf-
pack were clearly dominant.

State shot an unbelievable
67 percent from the floor in the
first half. Very few of their 50
first half points came from in
close, as Rivers, Thompson
and Monte Towe banged away

der his own basket and was all
but castrated trying to take
the ball back up while one
referee called a jump ball only
to be overruled by a traveling
call.

The lead went back and for-
th in the very physical first
half, while the Cats struggled
to manage a tie.

Davidson’s biggest lead in
the second half was seven
points and this margin did not
occur until the last minute.
The second half was also a nip
and tuck battle with no one
gaining a definite advantage.

With the score tied at 62 and
the crowd still yelling
Horowitz, the Cats ran seven
straight points to put the game
basically out of reach.

The Cats eventually won the
game 73-69 and will certainly
take this victory. The jayvees
got back on the track with a
win over the Bullpups.

Most of the field goals for
Davidson came from the big
men as it seemed that layups
were frequent when the Cats
broke the press. The guys who
handle the ball (Sorrentino,
Powell, Dunn and Falconi)
had a rough time from the
field. They were shaken by the
Citadel's physical defense and
managed only six for 23 from
the field with only Falconi hit-
ting 50%.

This group was also fouled
often as they were 17 for 23 at
the line. Overall the Cats shot
44% from the field and were 27
for 36 from the charity stripe.

Horowitz led all the David-
son scorers with 16 points and
was followed by Wagner with
12. Greg Dunn and Sheldon
Parker each had 10 while Mike

from the perimeter.

Trying to compensate for a
distinct height advantage,
Davidson stayed in a tight
zone defense for most of the
first half. The Cats challenged
the Pack to hit from the out-
side and the Pack did justthat.

Towe was_ seven-of-seven
from the field and had 15 poin-
ts while Rivers hit five of eight
for 12. Towe in particular was
devastating, as he dropped in
his wind up jump shot con-
sistantly from beyond 20 feet.

State began the game
shooting from the outside and
hoping to pull the Cats out of
their zone to allow Thompson
and Tommy Burleson to work
inside. The Cats refused to
come out, so Towe, Rivers,
Thompson and even Burleson
popped relatively freely from
15 to 25 feet.

The pattern in the second
half changed but the story
remained the same. The Cats

The Citadel was paced by
their flashy freshman guard
Rodney McKeever who had 13
points and eight assists. Chuck
Cordell and Jerry Colis each
had 12.

Conference but second place

be a very tough contest.

came out of the zone, so State
worked inside. Working the
ball first in to Thompson or
Burleson and then back out to
Spence, Stoddard and Rivers
driving in, State maintained
their dominance.

Sheldon Parker played well
against Burleson, holding him
to 13 points and seven reboun-
ds, with all of the points and
most of the rebounds coming
in the second half. Burleson
was in foul trouble early, but
Steve Nuce did « good board
job in his place.

The Cats seemed reluctant
to take some wide open 15 foot
jump shots. John Falconi and
Larry Horowitz in particular
passed up some open shots to
drive on the hoop and often
found their close range shots
rejected by State's big front
line.

Greg Dunn had nineteen
points despite numerous
blocked shots and some real
banging around. Mike Sorren-
tino continued to be consistent
from the outside and Paul
Wagner did another fine
rebounding job after coming
off the bench.

The Wildcats close out their
Johnston Gym schedule when
they meet East Carolina,
second in the Southern Con-
ference, Saturday night.

That will be the last appear-
