The Eyes Embarrass

Davidson Gentleman

He Is the Master of Every |
Situation But the Com-
mon One of Greeting. |

Is the Davidson “gentleman”
the master of all situations, so-
cial or otherwise? To hear
him talk, it would seem that
he has everything under con-
trol at all times and never is
caught off guard, no matter
how embarrassing the situa-
tion. He is able even to wig-
gle out of a situation involv-
ing two dates to one dance set
(it has been done), or main-
tain at least a vestige of dig-
nity when severely cut by a
professor.

But if he is the master of these,
there is another little situation oc-
curring many times é¢very day which
takes
the most blase of our students.

It doesn’t matter whether your

Then in contrast you meet the

with three new members being initi-

After the initiation John McLucas
read a paper on “Black Light.”
Black light is the part of the ultra-
violet range which is emitted from
mercury vapor lamps. It is not vis-
ible but has the unique property of
making things glow. It can be put
to use in modern warfare as well as
in ordinary usage. Lines can be
painted on roads which glow in the
black light from the headlight of
transportation trucks. Neither the
truck nor the road can be seen
from the air but the road can be
seen by the driver of the truck.

At the meeting were Professors

As His Subject “Spir-
itual Development.”

e

Speaking to the student
Sunday-school class on March
16, Shaw Smith presented a
few practical hints for spir-
itual development.

He pointed out that when
Christ came to earth, he came
not only to tell but tor show
how to lead the better life.
That visit meant more to us,
both Christians and non-Chris-
tians, than we realize. It has
affected our dating system, has
established many holidays, and
has changed our lives in many
external ways beside the
change wrought on religion.
Since this visit has influenced
our lives so much, let us in-
vestigate it.

Here at Davidson we have semi-
Christian non-Christian  ele-

constantly vacillates. We must stick
Because we are free
thinkers, we are not pushed enough
in our beliefs, and thus don’t make
any definite stand.

to one side.

Questions.

Shaw then asked a series of prac-
tical questions for us to ask our-
selves to determine what stand we
are taking. What do we use the
quiet music in church for? Do we
really sing hymns or are we just
saying words? How much faith
do we have in prayer? Do we real-

ly pray or are we just mumbling
words?

Our attitude toward such things
as church and prayer will ultimately
determine whether we have a satis-
fying faith or not. If we really
try, we can let these few sugges-
tions help us to develop a more
satisfying faith.

Live Convictions.

After we take a definite stand, we
must live our Religion. Men on the
campus expect us to be as good as
we are; if we are not we are hypo-
crites. We can never know the sat-
isfaction of the Christian religion
unless we live it.

you do: It's what you are!”

without exception report. that ev-

their love-sickness and “drooling”
increased. Several such couples
are reported to have completed
wedding plans, if the draft doesn’t
interfere.

Whatever type date one had
down, whatever the results may
have been, there’s always the next
dance set to look forward to.
