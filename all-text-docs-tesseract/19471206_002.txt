Athletic Policy ...

Since the letter by Jim Jackson, “46

ideas have been . formulating
course our football policy shall take in the
near future.

Sam Spencer, “40, debunked three of the
most popular ‘‘solutions’’—dropping- feet
ball, going big time, and becoming strictly
amateur, and suggested that Davidson Spear
heard negotiations for a new conference,

“A large body of the alumni and of the
students want football of he
writes. ‘The financial and publicity benefits
under no. circumstances become the prime
purposes of the football program, but to
frown upon these by-products simply because
they are liable to abuse is manifestly foolish.
To drop intercollegiate foothall would be
another step along the road of introversion
at-a tie when we need rather to turn out
ward to broaden. our relationships with other
institutions and point the way, if we ean, to
a satisfactory solution to this problem and
others. ’’

By engaging in a big-time program, Spen-
cer feels, we would probably bankrupt the
school and the alumni and also have tounder-
mine the academic standards of the college.

ournal, definite

about what

some ssort,”?

As for going amateur—it’s hardly possi-
ble. ‘‘If we are to have intercollgeiate foot-
ball at all, we must have a moderate num-
ber of students who are reasonably skilled at
the game, and anyone who has appraised the
incoming annual freshman receptions during
the last ten years know. that there have been
fewer and fewer athletes. among the new
newcomers to Davidson, With more and more
high schools competing for players, the
bidding has advanced to the point where al-
most every member of a high school team
who has shown any promise whatsoever, can,
and does, get an offer from some college.

‘‘What happens, then, to the college
which refuses to have anything to do with
subsidization in any form? It finds its nor-
mal constituency—the sons and grandsons of
its alumni, and in Davidson’s case, the boys
from Presbyterian homes—yielding to this
pressure from rival institutions. We cannot
play football with our ‘‘normal ¢omplement”’
of players, for the normal complement no
longer exists.

Is there any way. to brighten this rather
gloomy picture? Without advancing it as a
foolproof solution, I believe there is a policy
which offers a maximum chance for reason-
ably good football without the evils of the
big time:system. The keystone of that policy
would be a*plan of moderate and controlled
subsidization along the lines of our current
experiment, including :

(1) Tuition scholarships as the maximum
aid to be given; | ?

(2) Awarding of these scholarships only
by the faculty committee on grants-in-aid
which controls other grants, with absolute
prohibition of coach-player contracts;

(3) Absolutely no discrimination academ-
ically in favor of athletes, either in (a) ad-
mission policy or (b) in scholastic require-
ments once the student has enrolled.

In addition, the policy should be directed |

toward keeping the game a student activity:
of ten yearly contests, at least four should
be played on the Davidson campus, ‘This
would allow five games away as return visits
to other-schools, and would permit one of
the bigger contests to be played in Charlotte
for the purpose of accommodating a larger
crowd.

Having published this plan in specifie de-
tail. Davidson should take the lead in cir-
culating it to other colleges as, a possible
standard for a new football conference.
Though most of them are now practicing
heavy subsidization, 1 believe that many of
the colleges on our present schedule are
logical participants in such a league, and that
some would in the long run weleodine a way
out of a costly and not too satisfactory sys-
tem; | have in mind Washington and Lee,
the Citadel, V.M.L. the University of Rich-
mond, and Hampden-Sydney. Virginia Tech
is an additional possibility, and schools like
Sewanee and Centre which have avowed a

hands-eff—policy would also probably join _

if they saw reasonable assurance of adequate
control,

Obviously such a conference could not be
crystallized overnight. Of ten colleges initial-
ly invited, perhaps one or two would agree
to go ahead on a basis of the Davidson plan:
this, however, would form the nucleus ‘of
a league which could grow to completion
over a period of three, five, or even ten years.
As inore colleges joined, competitive bidding
for high school players would decrease in
proportion, thus helping to ease the pressure
of the present system,

T propose, then, that we move ahead with
the Jong range plan of forming a new con-
ference, probably through the initial step of
a well-planned and well-organized meeting
of college presidents and athletic directors
to be held at Davidson, In the meantime we
shoud strictly adhere*to the plan we have

A New Idea

Johusten, “OL, to
liolding the world’s record for seeing foot-
hall games, thinks we ought to get back in
the big time, but continue our present
policies. ‘There seems to besa prevailing
notion in’North Carolina,’ he writes, ‘that,
a good football player will not p'ay unless he
is paid, and there is another prevailing no-
tion among many of Davidson alumni that
it somehow disgraceful, disintegrating,
and positively immoral, to be consistently
beaten by any team. Now, if these two as-
sumptions are correct then Davidson is im a
bad spot, but let’s analyze them a little bit

wih a few
seems to

solution to

doe who comes close

Is

“The first theory has been exploited to
the extent that very few boys now get a
chance to play unless they are paid and
probably Davidson College is the only college
of its rank in North Carolina where a stu
dent has a chance to go to college on his own
and through his own ability make the team,

“1 believe that there are a lot of boys who
are able and willing to go to, college and pay
their own way and who still like to play foot-
ball. There may not be enough right now to
make a world beater at any college but from
year to year they will make a pretty re-
spectable showing.

‘‘Now, about the other assumption that
Davidson should not play teams that con-
sistently beat her. Well, how about playing
teams that we consistently beat? Do the boys
that go to those colleges belong to an inferior
race, and do they come out of those colleges
hopélessly handicapped from having played
on losing teams?

“Ought Davidson to expect to win all
their games? To win a few, lose a few, some-
times more on one side, sometimes more on
the other, and not to stand off and view
Carglina and Duke through a telescope as
though they belonged to a constellation far
above our, humble status, Let’s throw away
‘the telescope and ineet them face to face,
shoulder to shoulder, ;

“If Davidson should give way to the
hysteria of paid athletes and big-time stuff
and neglect its students who go there on
their own, it will take longer for them to live
down the reputation they get by so doing than
it‘ will for them to forget the disgrace of
being the underdogs in the Big Five right
now. I venture to say that the picture ten
years from. now will be so different from
what it is now that we will wonder why we
ever had any notion of attempting to eom-
pete with these big boys in hiring players.

“IT know good athletes wno have gone to
Carolina and who have told me that they
wished they had gone to Davidson instead.
They have never had a chance to play at
Carolina: they would at least have had a
chance at Davidson, That idea is spreading to
more and more people and it will eventually
pay big dividends.”’

of this nature in that war-ravaged
nation, I'd like to make a few ran-
dom remarks about the situation
which prevails there.

Sendai, located on the island of
Honshu, rail and university
center lying some 200 miles north
of Tokyo. During the war it was
one of the principal targets for
American bombers and when the
fighting finally ceased in August,
1945, the remnants of its 140,000
people were, in the most cases,
homeless. I didn't have an opportu-
nity to observe the effects of the
bombs on Nagasaki

their elders followed when they

saw the GIs giving candy and ra-
tions to the kids, In time the peo-
ple realized that their propaganda
machine had painted a false picture
of their enemies, and the friendli-
ness of the average American did
much to break down the barriers
to mutual understanding. At the
end of the first year of occupation,
the hostility had all but disappeared.

Admittedly we have accomplished
a great deal there already, but there
is still much to be done. Japan is

After graduation from | avidson | In the Freshman* English book
as a Phi Beta Kappa in 1947, Prof. |is an essay by Stephen Teacock

concerning the small college. Pro-
fessor Lilly is much in accord with

}the author, for he believes that
| there is a definite place for the
small college of high academic

| standing, a college of high quality
work rather than quantity, He's par-
ticularly in favor of a small college
away from the distractions of the
city, Where students have time to
read and to think, and where char-
acter may be developed.

Before coming to Davidson
where he received his AB degree,
Prof. Lilly went to Vanderbilt Uni-
versity, later studying at Princeton.
He taught at. McCallie School’ and
at Vresbyterian College, prior to
becoming a professor at’ Davidson:

In line with his work, Prof. Lilly
is interested greatly in word study
—and says that perhaps his fresh-
man students think him a bit too in-
terested in this hobby.

(-Prof. Lilly has much admiration
for the favored Johnny Appleseed.
That admiration comes through his
hobby of planting trees..He en-

Lwo factors, the very regrettable

outstanding of his 1947

decision for Davidson. We now
stand at a crossroads. We can
either continue on the upward trail
to better football, or we can shift
to a small team conference and
drop out of the picture’ so far as
