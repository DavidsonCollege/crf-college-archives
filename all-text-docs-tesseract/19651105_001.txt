Delayed Rush Continues

The second week of Dav-
idson’s delayed rush system
will begin Sunday afternoon
when 270 freshmen will
visit the six fraternity
houses they did not see last
Saturday.

Johnny Jeter. chairman of the
Interfraternity Council's rush

committee, said he believes the |

new system is working well,
especially considering its new-
ness and experimental nature.

He termed last Saturday aft-
ernoon's activities, ‘‘a little long,
a little tiring,"’ but added, ‘‘most
of the freshmen got something
out of it. I think they were glad
to see what the court. looks like
since they hadn't had.a chance
to go down there before.“

This second series of rush par-

ties follows the first period of
derm rush which was from 3:30.
to 5:30. p.m. on Tuesday. The

IFC tentatively plans dorm rush, |

according to Jeter, for each

Tuesday afternoon during the.

next three weeks. He indicated,
however, that this period might
be extended a week or two if
necessary.

“We. want the freshmen to
try to meet the upperclassmen,”
Jetér commented. “The more
they see of the upperclassmen
and the more acquaintances they
make, the better they're going
to be able to decide which fra-
ternity is right for them.”

One fraternity man comment-
ed, ‘‘a lot of people want either
more dorm rush or none at all,”
explaining that two hours per
week is an awkward amount of
time,

Jeter pointed out that time is
indeed a problem in both dorm
rush and weekend parties for
three reasons: fraternity men

is going out for rush.

“All fraternity men _ realize
this is a big change from past
years,’ concluded Jeter. “I
think they also realize there is
still room for improvement,” he
added. mentioning two of sev-

made from original rush plans
already: the initiating of dorm
rush and the change of rush par-
ties from Saturdays to Sundays.

*‘When we made up the rules
last year (we coyldn’t make
them up until May), we weren't

able to see all the various prob-
lems which would come up this
fall,” he added. “I think we
should use this year as an ex-
periment with our system .
so that we can avoid difficulty
in the future.”

Controversy Swirls Over

By JOHNNY CLARK
Davidsonian Associate Editor

Concern over the implications
of the new, faculty-approved
drinking rule has dominated cur-
tent discussion among various
elements of the college and has
prompted continued considera-
tion of the drinking situation by
the joint Facuilty-Trustee Com-
mittee on Alcoholic Beverage
Policy.

In effect, the action by the
faculty last month has removed
all official college restrictions
on drinking by Davidson stu-
dents outside of the Davidson
city limits, with the exception
that the “gentlemanly conduct”
rule is still applicable to stu-
dents at all dme. .

The controversy began after
the five-man committee, in

which Dr. J. G. Martin and Dr.
W. G. Workman represent the
faculty, recommended to the
faculty a rule change that would
permit drinking at fraternity
parties and other functions
which are neither directly spon-
sored by the college nor at
which students are officially rep-
resenting the college.

In effect, the proposal was
to recognize officially the status
quo, while retaining the restric-
tions on college-sponsored, off.
campus functions and on other
functions at which studente are
representing the college.

An amendment that would de-
lete. “restrictions on students
outside of Davidson was nar-
rowly approved instead.

“The point is.” noted one pro-
fessor who supported the amend-

ment in its final form, ‘‘that it
is impossible to deliniate among
all the possible instances in
which a student may ar may not
be representing the college or
to determine what sort of func-
tion may be construed as par-
tially sponsored by the college.”

The faculty member cited
such inconsistencies as the situ-
ation of a student “representing
the college’ in the Junior Year
Abroad program.

“We feel that the problem is
best handled by Hmiting the co)-
lege regulations to the area
where they be effectively en-
forced and where the college is
logically responsible—the David-
son campus—while retaining the
gentlemanly conduct rule to deal
with any possible excesses that
might arise,” he concluded.

Change

In_ additions to elements
among the faculty and admin.
istration, opposition to the rule
changes has come from Social
Council Chairman Dan Camp-
bell.

“*Naturaly.” says Campbell,
“the change puts pressure on
the Social Council to sponsor
off-campus parties so that stu-
dents may drink.

“I personally would favor al-
lowing students to drink at on-
campus functions and I approve
of the change concerning drink-
ing at off-campus fraternity par-
ties,” stated Campbell. ‘But
short of allowing drinking at
weekend functions on campus
I prefer going back to the old
‘rule concerning  college-spon-
sored affairs,”” he added.

“The new situation brings the

In Drinking Regulation

problem of the expense of rent-
ing a place to have some of our
functions away from Davidson,
and also creates the problem of
student transportation to and
from the functions, complicated
by the fact that many will have
been drinking. And if the present
tule stands, we will almost cer-
tainly have to have an off-cam-
pus party,”’ he explained.

Campbell stated further that
he had sent a letter to Presi-
dent D. Grier Martin express-
ing these views and that he in-
tends to meet with the presi-
dent to discuss the problem
further.

President Martin declined to
discuss the subject with a DAV-
IDSONIAN reporter this week,
but indicated through his as-
sistant that he would have no

statement until after the faculty
meeting next week.

One faculty member claimed
that Martin's opposition to the
change was indicated by the an-
nouncement by the president's
office after the faculty action
that the matter would be con-
sidered by the Trustees.

“Ordinarily,” observed the
source, “faculty action {s not
even presented for Trustees ap-
proval, except in unusual cases
such as the faculty action con-
cerning fraternities last spring.”

Further opposition has come
from various members of the
athletic department, principally
coaches of the minor sports, who
have expressed fear that. drink-

ing by athletes on team trips -

might be difficult to prevent.
“I doubt that this would be

the case,”’ noted Assistant Ath-
letic Director Heath Whittle,
“but the possibility is now open
for athletes to drink on trips,
and since the minor sports have
no scholarships, a problem of
team discipline could conceiv-
ably arise." |

Officially the Board of Trus-
tees recommended further study
by the joint faculty-trustee com-
mittee, and the committee is ex-
pected to report on the matter
at the faculty meeting Tues-
day.

“I hope that the faculty will
stick by their guns,"’ commented
one senior. “Recognition of even
limiteé student responsibility in
the atea of dirnking is a step
toward removing the glorified
prep school atmosphere that
Davidson still retains to a large
degree.”
