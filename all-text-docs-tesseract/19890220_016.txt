Wrestling

Team sees light at Gardner-Webb

By HOLME OLTROGGE

The Davidson wrestling team
went on the road for three of their
last four dual matches of the sea-
son. With three wrestlers on
Wednesday night, February 8, the
Cats encountered Wilkes in
Wilkesboro, NC.

Sophomores Pete Buss, Joe
Binns and Eric Farmer wrestled
two matches each. All came off
the mat in humble defeat.

Saturday’s six-hour ride back
from Atlanta seemed even longer
as the Cats faced the Georgia
Tech Yellowjackets. This time
freshman Chris Clark joined the
other three on the trip. Clark and
Buss wrestled one match each

while Binns and Farmer encoun-
tered two grueling matches. As
Binns and Clark conceded in
agreement, “We got hammered.”

But light finally dawned on the
persistent Davidson wrestlers last
Wednesday.

They met Gardner-Webb in
Boiling Springs, NC and came
home with victories in five out of
six matches. The Cats not only de-
feated their opponents, but they
also embarassed them. ~

Captain Joe Binns wrestled at
the 142 and 150 pound weight
classes. He won both matches 14-
5 and 13-5. Binns definitely im-
proved wrestling on his feet as he
came away with 14 out of 20 team

takedowns. At 158 and 167, Chris
Clark shut out one opponent with
six points and manhandled the
other 17-3. Eric Farmer pinned
his man at 190, but lost the second
match in the heavyweight class.

Last Wednesday’s sweet victo-
ries gave the Cats the boost they
were looking for all year.

These individuals had been en-
during injuries and vacancies in
the line up out of sheer persis-
tence. It was time their patience
paid off. The season had been
filled with frustrating defeats, but
it was a relief that it ended on a
high note.

The Cats face Furman this Sat-
urday in Greenville, SC.

Player profile: Jay Schmitt

Jay Schmitt 90
Basketball
Mathematics major
6' 8"
220 pounds

Jay was at his computer,
hooked up to the VAX system,
working on his Data Structure &
Algorithms (Mat 321) assignment
when I visited him. He had a few
minutes before going to the gym
to refree, of all sports, an IMAC
basketball game.

I apologized for not having a
photo to print with this Profile;
perhaps he could provide a candid
shot of himself. No, Jay did not
think he had anything, but Be his
coed friend said she could find
something. At this suggestion,
Jay could be heard groaning ‘to
himself, “Oh no! You’re not seri-
ous are you?” Sure, Jay, why not?

Like many tall kids in school,
Jay was plagued by the ever-obvi-
ous “encouragement to ‘go out for
basketball. He did not play on any
organized team until the seventh
grade when he went to the private
Montgomery Bell Academy in
Nashville.

After physical education and
summer camps in basketball, he
started on the MBA varsity team

Buckle Up For Sprin

from his sophomore to his senior
years under coach Mark Elliott,
an ex-player from Vanderbilt and
now an assistant coach there.
Currently the starting guard for
the Davidson team, Schmitt pro-
vided the sorely needed leader-

ship for the young basketball

squad.

What about collegiate basket-
ball? Schmitt could not see him-
self coming to Davidson without
playing basketall. He was a gung-
ho freshman who devoted about
60% of his time to basketball,
30% to academics and 10% to
socializing. But now that he was a
wiser junior, the time was split
more or less evenly, with academ-
ics having aslight edge, of course.

Still, basketball was in him; it
built character. It helped him
manage his time efficiently.
When the team took a couple of
weeks off, Jay did not know what
to do with the extra time. Besides,
it kept him in the best possible
health. And. about being per-
ceived as a superstar? Schmitt
saw no such image in himself.

Anything else besides basket-
ball? Sure. Jay loved to go fishing
with his dad, which they have
been doing since Jay was 5 or 6
years old. A white water kayaker
from the seventh. grade on,

Schmitt had gone down Class 4-5
rivers. (For the landlovers, the
rating of white water rivers
ranged from Class 1 to Class 6,
and sometimes up to Class 8.) He
had paddled with classmates Clay
Wright and John Davis.
Schmitt’s favorite course was
Dr. Roberts’ Mathematical Mod-
eling class, because it was fun.
They undertook real life projects
such as working with the Finan-
cial Aid office and-testing the
Union Cafe Cat Card when it first
came out. It didn’t hurt to getan A
in the class either.
People whom he admired?
There were so
many that he
could not
single out any
one. But he
could name a
favorite car-
toon charac-
ter: Opus from
Bloom
County.
Opus’ man-
nerisms
struck Jay as
hilarious and
sometimes as-
tute. On_ his
