of the biggest problems for
Davidson Recycles.

The school no longer recycles
glass because last year the glass
would pile up in the shed and be-
come dangerous. A few dedicated
peopl¢ sort the glass, but efficiency
fell to a minimum.

This is still a problem. Even
with the elimination of glass recy-
cling, students are still needed to
sort the goods now collected. Cur-
rently, there are around six stu-
dents who come and sort.

Those who do give their time
to sorting face further problems.
The company that the school cur-
rently uses charges large fees when
the sorting is not done correctly.

The dumpsters that collect the
goods are also expensive. Accord-
ing to Tony Owens, Assistant
Building services manager and a
crusader for a better recycling pro-
gram, each dumpster costs almost
$6000.

Owens cites another large
problem: “Everyone is trying to
recycle everything at once, but we
don’t have the manpower for it. If
we took it gradually and got good
atone thing and then another, we
might be able to do a better job.”

In the dorms, cleanliness and
sanitation are a problem. Recy-
cling bins in each hall would help,
but that would increase the already

problematic dorm bug population.
Says Owens, “cleanliness is our
number one priority.”

The union decided to recycle
independently because, according
to Assistant Director of Operations
Mike Goode, when they recycled
with Davidson, everything fell
apart.

As Goode states, though, they
are suffering from a type of moral
dilemma, for they have been en-
couraged to stay with Davidson
Recycling in order to make the
recycling problem bigger. Some
people believe that if the problem
gets big enough, the administra-
tion will be forced to do something
about it.

The union decided, however,
recycling was more important than
getting involved in school politics.

Financial support is not al-
ways such an easy answer. Goode
States the problem clearly: “We
are all trying to make it less expen-
sive.to go to school here.”

What can be done?

The school is presently chang-
ing recycling companies, and the
new system appears to be more
efficient and less expensive. Owens

has been researching recycling pro- .

grams at other schools, and is try-
ing to do all that he can to improve
Davidson’s.

Improvements are happening
every day. This week Davidson
Recycles begins to recycle plastics

"How to
when you thi

'do' math
nk you can't."

on Patterson Court. Soon, the pro-
gram will be selling individual re-
cycling bins for student’s rooms.

Right now, the major prob-
lems seem to be lack of student
involvement and lack of adminis-
trative support. With an increase
in both of these things, Davidson
Recycles might be able to start
over with a better program.

Says one faculty member, “It's
got to come from the top. This is
why our program isn’t working.”
He goes on to point out that at all
colleges that have successful recy-
cling programs have had some sort
of presidential mandate.

Student involvement is nec-
essary as well. Professor David
Martin of the economics depart-
ment, who petitioned for the recy-
cling room in Chambers, laments
that students aren’t taking the time
to recycle. He sees students every
day “throw their cans away in the
trash when a recycling bin is right
there.”

Says Owens, “Ifmore students
could hdlp out the few dedicated
ones we have, it could work. For
this program to be successful, we
need everybody.”

Midwinters draws crowds
but leaves others discontent

~—By Ashlyn Dannelly ——

Forty-two years ago,
Davidson fraternity members en-
joyed a Midwinter’s weekend just
as the current Davidson students
did last weekend. In “This Week
in Davidson” for the week of Feb-
ruary 10-17, 1952, the Pan-Hel-
lenic Midwinter Dances were listed
for Saturday, February 16.

However, many Davidson stu-
dents now view the Midwinters
weekend as a tradition which
causes division between different
groups on campus. Sophomore
Allison Sabel won the SGA vice-
presidency recently with a cam-
paign promise of an all-campus
dance.

For most people, the
weekend’s activities revolved
around Patterson Court. The fra-
ternities hold individual functions,
which cancause problems for those
girls who do not get asked. Fresh-
man Kathy Harker had a date for
the weekend, but says that some of
her friends who didn’t get dates
were “a little upset... itcan be hard
on the girls to wait for the guys to
ask.”

The men’s houses have two
other weekends similar to Mid-
winters: Homecoming and Spring
Frolics. This leaves some people
asking if that number is too many.

Junior Melissa Ream says,

“Freshman year would have been.

mortified not to have a date, but
now I realize that it’s just another
weekend on Patterson Court;
people are just dressed up.”

On Friday, The Samples
played in Love Auditorium, which
was enjoyed by many students.
However, that event was the only
one of the weekend which brought
most of the campus together. The
Union sponsored a semiformal,
“Davidson on Ice,” on Saturday
night for all students, but it was not
as well-attended as fraternity
events.

Murchison enjoyed the weekend,
because he was asked by some
friends to attend one fraternity’s ~
functions. He says, "I think (Mid-
winters) is good, because there is
not that really that much going on
in January and February. It’s bet-
ter than just a regular weekend.”
Murchison is skeptical about re-
placing Midwinters with an all-
campus event: “I think it’s a good
idea, but I don’t know if it would
work.”

Junior Laurie Self disagrees:
“I think it would be incredible and
would definitely help campus unity
and independent students to have
an all-campus event. It needs to be
campus-wide.”

One junior fraternity member,
who asked not to be named, objects
to such an event: “If you’re inde-
pendent, you pretty much gave up
the option of going to Midwinters.
You shouldn’t expect the fraterni-
ties to have an option for you— the
college has an option.”

Ream hopes to see an all-cam-
pus weekend, but says that “Patter-

son Court needs to support it finan-
cially, and perhaps get a big band.
It needs to be oifterent: from what

the. Union offers now.”
Yorer Derek Spencer offers a

different idea: “Midwinters still is
lacking. I think there should be a
situation where the women’s eat-
ing houses have something like
that, but all during the same week-
end. It would put a different light
on it for the guys.”

When asked about an all-cam-
pus event, Spencer adds: “Patter-
son Court would have to endorseit.
Lunar Luau is like that, and whether
or not it is a good thing, there are
still a lot of people there. People
will follow what everyone else is
doing.”

People think

there are limits to what we can
do, that its out of our reach to
really change the way things are.
I feel there is no limit to what we
can do—it only depends on

how much of ourselves we

want to give.
