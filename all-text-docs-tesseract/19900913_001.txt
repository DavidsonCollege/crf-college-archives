Although the Solidarity Com-
mittee may appear to be a rela-
tively new organization on cam-
pus, ithas actually been around for
several years. The committee was
formed by the Student Govern-
ment Association (SGA) in 1984
in response to a KKK march that
was planned for Davidson.

The committce was created
to counter the KKK march by set-
ting up a Solidarity rally on cam-
pus. The Solidarity event was a

- huge success, but after that day

was over, the committee became
inactive.

During this dormant period,
the committee remained on the
SGA charter: It was not until last
year that the SGA reactivated the
Solidarity Committee. It became
active again because of rising in-
terests about racial concerns on

campus. The SGA chose the
members and provided the com-
mittee with a budget.

The committee is led by four
officers: Rafacl Sanchez-Aballi,
Michelle Blake, Joe Cook and a
yet-to-be-determined freshman.
Last year the committee staged
several events, including a prayer
vigil on Martin Luther King Jr.’s
birthday. More events are sched-
uled for this year as the committee
is restructured and chair positions
are filled.

The Solidarity Committee has
a number of objectives for this
year. They intend to raise aware-
ness of the importance of people of
different nationalities, creed, race
and color oncampus. The commit-
tee also hopes to improve the rela-
tionship between the College and
the African-American population
in the town.

According to Sanchez-Aballi,

__ ** Committee Focuses on Campus Unity

the committce is “Optimistic to
taking a leading role for the quality
of life of minorities on campus.”
To achieve this, Sanchez-Aballi
believes that establishing dialogue
among all peoples on campus is
essential to improving the quality
of life. Sanchez-Aballialso intends
for the committce to become highly
visible and more involved because
thcir mission is essential and vital
to Davidson.

The Solidarity Committee is
open to everyone. There is no limit
on membership. The first meeting
will be held Monday, September
17 at 8:00 p.m. in the Union.

The committce will then mect
every two wecks to carry out their
objectives.

Forums, events for Hispanic
Heritage Weck and a Martin Lu-
ther King Jr. celebration are al-,
ready planned for the upcoming
year.

Perry said that the current trouble
in the Middle East is likely to be a
major topic of conversation for the
French Ambassador, since France
and Britain are the only two NATO
allies actively collaborating with
the U.S. The futures of Europe and
NATO may also be discussed.
Andreani is a graduate of the
Institutd’Etudes Politiques de Paris
and the Ecole Nationale d’ Admin-
istration. A career diplomat, he
began his service in 1953 at the

Davidson College music depart-
ment, was the flutist. Others who
helped out with the event include
Eloise Carter, Nannie Potts and
Dora DuBose. x

Despite his late arrival, Gantt
gave a short talk to the forty or so
people gathered for the reception.
His speech was essentially a pep
talk from the heart, urging people
to remain active in their support of
his campaign.

Gantt also asked for everyone
to work to persuade others to help
out in his race with Helms fora US
Senate seat. Acknowledging that
the road ahead will be tough, Mr.
Gantt said that by continuing to
work, everyone can help to “Bring
Jesse home.” -

Although there wasnotashigh
atumoutas James wouldhave liked,
the fundraiser was considered a
success. About $2000 was pledged
to Gantt’s campaign at the event
and through pledge cards sent out
around the area.

Vail Commons Feeds 110
Extra Mouths This Semester

By GEORGE LAFAYE

As a result of the larger than
usual freshman class and more up-
perclassmen choosing to dine at
the Commons, the Dining Service
now has 751 students: on their
contract-meal program, up from
640 last year.

Carleton Pritchard of the Din-
ing Service says that the increasc is

notsolely due to the increase in the .

_ size of the freshman class, but is
also a result of more upperclass-
men using the Commons,

Inaddition to the influx caused
by the closing of PAX, Pritchard
says that new developments in the
Dining Service have made eating

at the Commons more attractive.
Principal among these. new
ideas is a new focus on nutrition
including the addition of a staff
nutritionist who, among other du-
ties, assists students in developing
sensible dietary regimens. .
~~ According to Pritchard, the
dining staff has been able to cope
with the recent influx. He says,
“We’re glad to have more people
eat here. The more the merrier.”
