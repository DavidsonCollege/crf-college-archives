FRIDAY. MAY 17. 1963

I  . éditer do not. necessarily reflect ie views of the editor.)

On Reinstatement .

Last week this editor mentioned
the sense of fair play that characteriz-
es Dr. J. McDowell Richards. and ex-
pressed. a hope that Dr. W. F. Goody-
koontz would be given a hearing by

the trustees. Dr. Richards and the
other three members of the Trustee
Committee on Education not only gave
Dr. Goodykoontz a fair hearing. but
rendered a decision which kept the
integrity of all concerned intact.

In its statement of reinstatement.
the committee reaffirmed its support
of Dean F. W. Johnston. and the fact
that the recommendation for rein-
statement. which was accepted came
from the dean stands as a vote of

confidence. At the same time, the
committee's action reflects a desire
on their part to deal fairly with a man
who has made an outstanding contri-
bution to the college.

In connection with the part of the
trustee story last week which concern-
ed .Dr. James P. Hendrix, this editor
wishes to state that the implication of
duplicity on Dr. Hendrix’ part was
based on what this editor believes was
a misinterpretation af a misunder-
standing. This matter is discussed in
a letter on this. page written by. Dr.
Goodykoontz. which points out that
the reporters involved were acting in
good faith on the information they had
received.

A Word Of Appreciation

If the chaplaincy at Davidson in-
volved .only the paperwork necessary
to secure speakers for chapel and
vespers. a man could fill the position
adequately in an eight-hour day.

But it is another matter to have
to be constantly concerned with try-
ing to help students pick up the pieces
of a personal faith which has under-
gone a mauling in class and bull ses-
Sions.

Selah To 1962-63

As this is the last issue of .THE
DAVIDSONIAN this year. we would
like to close with a summary of the
positive side of 1962-63.

Next year a Great Issues program
comes to Davidson, backed amply by
$4.000. and such a program could be
invaluable as a means of focusing
Davidson attention on the outside
world.

Scholastically, Davidson took sev-
eral significant strides forward this
year. The Humanities program. mater-
ialized. An advanced standing  pro-
gram complete with full credit was
approved for the first time by the
faculty. The language requirement
was altered to emphasize knowledge
of a language rather than number of
semester hours acquired. Several de-
partments, recently Biology, are con-
sidering or have already set up pro-
grams which allow intensive personal
study in a field for credit. The Ma-
chine Age arrived at Davidson in the
form of a computer. A French Honors
program was begun.

The student reaction to the new
cut policy indicated that Davidson

This latter task requires close

area that Will Terry has made a tre-
mendous effort. Learning almost 1,000
people by name in a year is a remark-
able feat. but this familiarity with the
chaplain has given a great many stud-
ents the feeling that there is an adult
on campus to whom. they can take
serious problems. It feels good to walk

doors wide open.

students can and will take responsibili-
ty. and this no doubt figured into the
administration's deeision to liberalize
the vespers attendance requirement to
include Sunday morning services in
Davidson.

Socially. the Independents found
a home in Lingle Manor, and the col-
lege lake site added a new dimension
to the campus.

Davidson sports generally had a
good year, and next vear the overall
program could well hit an all-time
high. Football will be stronger. and
the baseball! team returns virtually in-
taet. The basketball team had their
best season ever. and should run wild
next vear. Several of the teams in
other sports finished high in confer-
ence competition, and. particularly in
the case of tennis, should have good
seasons in the coming school year.

Anyway, there are just two more
weeks of school until summertime.
and then come at least a few days of
sweetness and light until summer
work, summer camp and summer
school begin. To the graduating
seniors: good luck, and please sub.
scribe to our newspaper next year.

The Last Blast

By Ackerman Snarrow Flies Off

Unnoticed By Flock

Conservative Students Sweep

Liberal NSA Off 32 Campuses

BY CHARLES RAMBERG
Davidsonian Managing Editor

Last Wednesday the Student
Council: voted to retain mem-
bership inthe National Student
Association for the coming yéar.

During the discussion some-
one suggested that perhaps the
student body as a whole should
be, given the opportunity to

“ make the choice on whether or

not.to:retain membership in the
controversial organization, us-
ually termed ultra-liberal by its
conservative critics. The. issue
has never been submitted to a
student body referendum.

“They (the students) don't
know the problem as weil as we
do.” warned Danny Carrell, ex-
student body president. And-the
councit went along with him,
making the choice itself.

On other campuses, stud-
ents dissatisfied with this sort
of dictation from above have
taken the matter into their
own hands, resulting in a
formidable series of setbacks
for NSA.

Human Events, a conservative

weekly, has déseribed hoi stud
ents’ voted. to oust local NS\

chapters at Indiana University -

and. the University of Texas in
its issues of April 20 and Apri!
27.

At Indiana, with 23.000 «tud-
ents. the vote went 407] 2526
against NSA. At Texas. with
more than 22.600. enouzh voters
turned out to vote 2102 1453
against NSA affiliation.

Despite such low turnouts. the
margins against NSA have been
heavy. The trend to reject NSA
affiliation seems to be gaining
momentum across the nation.
Since August 1961, 32 colleges
and universities with an aggre-
gate enrollment of 226,000 have
severed affiliation with NSA.

A list of schools departing the
NSA fold includes: Ohio State
University, University of Texas,
Northwestern University, Uni-
versity of Missouri, University
of Oklahoma, University of Ne-
braska. University of Kansas,
Vanderbilt University, and In-
diana University.

In addition. 14 schools with a
total of 112.000 enrolled have
rejected. proposed NSA.member-
ship since 1961. A few of these
are: Purdue University. George
Washington University, Univer-
sity of Virginia, University of
Kentucky, American University,
Washington & Lee University.

“Today,” crows Human

Events, “this organization—

which once ruled the campus

roost—represents less than

1/5 of the 2011 institutions

available for NSA member.

ship.”

Human Events listed five rea-
sons that conservative groups
have been able to rid their cam-
puses of-NSA.

1. The nebulous conserva-

tive revolt on the campuses.

2. Efforts of Young Repub-
lican Clubs and chapters of
Young Americans for Free-
dom.

YAF, organized in August,
1961 to fight liberal fire with
‘the conservative variety, has
chosen NSA as its chief target.
Human Events traces the de-

cline of NSA. from the date of

YAF’s founding.

At Indiana, the YAF chapter
and the YR Club spearheaded. a
“STOP NSA” committee. At
Texas it was a “Committee for
a Responsible Student Govern-
ment" that sparked the drive to

oust NSA. The committees wrote -

superiority.

with literature, and spoke on the
issue before student groups.

3. “Underhanded” tactics
employed by the liberals.

At’ Texas. student petitions
for a referendum on_ that
school’s affiliation: with NSA
were certified by the student
attorney general only after a
two-week delay. And if that
wasn't enough harrassment, the
final straw was when the attor-
ney general! invalidated the peti-
tions because, due to the delay,
it would have been “impracti-
cal” to hold the referendum at
the time requested.

Also at Texas, a “non-parti-
san” student government com-
mittee was set up to get the
facets on the issue and present
them to the student body in the
pages of the Daily Texan. But
the move backfired in liberal
faces when the head of the com-
mittee. who was. respansible for
choosing the rest of the com-
mittee members and the wit-
nesses to appear before it. prov-
ed to be an avowéd NSA sup-
porter. Only one witness called
by the committee spoke against
NSA.

4. NSA intrusion.

The NSA. bylaws forbid parti-
san political activities on cam-
puses by wational officers. But
at both Indiana and Texas, NSA
officials mysteriously turned up
to ald students supporting NSA.
At. Indiana, NSA paid for an ad
in the student newspaper that
quoted the House Committee on
Un-American Activities as hav-
ing called NSA an “effective”
anti-Communist organization. Al-
though HUAC, a frequent NSA
target, emphatically denied the
charge, NSA repeated. the state-
ment in another ad in the In-
diana paper on the day of the
election.

5. NSA does not represent
students.

“While few students have
ever heard of NSA and most
have no opportunity to register

Desiunciation of U.S. measures of achieve nuclear

BY GREG GOVAN
Davidsonian Feature Writer

“Davidson is a particular kind
of college. It is a liberal arts

| college rather than a university

or vocational school. 11 is a small
college. priding itself on the
personal relationship between.
students and faculty, students
and their fellows.”

But of course there are a few
exceptions to the college cata-
logue’s earnest solicitations for
boys of genius whose parents
have heard of “your great
abilities.”

On December 8. 1962. Gerald
Chambers received a card which
stated that he had better not
miss another Vespers unless he
wanted to spend a month in
Davidson. Or rather, his post
office box received the letter,
because Chambers, G. T., Mur-
phy, N. C. had transferred from
Davidson in mid-October.

Since he was campused, he
might as well work, so the Of-
fice of Admissions and Financial
Aid sent him a letter asking if
he were interested in working

there 5 to 10 hours a week. That
was in. January.

In February, Jerry received a
bid to, Eumenean Literary So-
ciety. who certainly out-compet-
‘ed Phi in “the bidding of fresh-
men who have distinguished
themselves in literary endeav-
ors.”

And last month Jerry was
asked to help reactivate the old
college Baptist Student Union.
Maybe he would be a foreign
missionary at Western Carolina.

There are some bright spots.
The Eumenean letter was care-
ful to note that recommenda-
tion “is based ou your academic
interests shown during the last
semester.” Which is a good trick
for someone who was only here
a month and a half.

So when you read about
drama, fine arts, and literary
magazines at the center of edu-
cation, culture, and learning in
the South, just remember old.

LETTERS TO
Goodykoontz

Dear Editor:

Dr. James Hendrix has stated
to me and to others that I mis-
understod him when. I quoted
him; in last week's DAVIDSON-
LAN, as saving that he had never
heard my name before. Dr. Hen-
drix explained that what he had
really said was that he had
never heard of my case before.

Of ‘course, since the two
sounds — name and case —
are fairly similar, | hope it
will be understood that my
mistake was an unintentional
one, | make this correction in
fairness to Dr. Hendrix, who
seemed to feel thet this error
was of some significance.

As one widely known as an
able and active member of the
Education Committee of the
Board of Trustees, Dr. Hendrix

Martin Clarifies Position,
Supports Desegregation

Dear Editor:

Of the ten faculty members
interviewed for an article print-
ed three weeks ago, six (named
therein) were reported as giving
unqualified “yes” responses to
a question of whether Charlotte
hotels and restaurants “should
be desegregated.” Three others
(also named) were reported to
agree “with the abstract concept
of desegregation.”

This left only one interviewee
(myself), presently identified
and characterized in words “that
it was completely up to the
owner of the facility involved,
that it made no difference” to
me.

The reader, without contrary
information, could either con-
clude that I was simply apathe-
tic, or, since 1 was not listed as
having given a qualified or un-
qualified affirmation of deseg-
regation. that I was an advocate
of. segregation, which is not so.

Personally, 1 would prefer
that the hotels, etc., not be
segregated, but J would defin-
iwely want the decision to de-
segregate to come from the
managers, who are responsi-

ble for their businesses in a

way that the rest of us are

not.

There are a number of ways
one can assist such a change:
if one has influence, he may use
it; without this, he may engage
in a protest action. The case in
question shows that both may
be useful. The picketing could
bring unfavorable publicity, but
essential factors were the good
intentions of several managers,
and the coerdination of their
concerted decision by those who

had previously earned their re-
spect.

The question of government
responsibility is a difficult one.
IT hope that no more than the
prestige of the offices of Mayor
and Governor was involved,
since I am not convinced that a
“public trust” should be forced
by law or licensing conditions
to reinforce the majority or
minority view.on such a con-
troversial issue. Advocates of
either position may picket or
boycott (and in this case the
wish to attract conventions was
probably a related considera-
tion).

The foregoing is neither
novel nor authoritative. In fact
parts are similar to statements
attributed to others in the ar-
ticle, though differing in em-
phasis or context of political
philosophy: which may explain
why the 15-minute interview
provided only one remark worth
paraphrasing (and one might say
it was novel indeed!) In any
case. there are others whose
opinions could have been in-
cluded to balance the collection
without misusing mine.

| appreciate the opportuni-
ty to correct possible damage
to a personal Image, which in
this case must be a Facade of
consummate purity, to be
sure.

In the future, greater care
should be used in representing
opinions on a controversial sub-
ject; otherwise, many will fol-
low the example of another per-
son interviewed, who was “re-
luctant to state his personal
opinion” (and well-advised!)

THE EDITOR

would, of course—as he pointed
out—be. likely to know the
names of most of the members
of the faculty; and. of course. I
accept his explanation without
question.

I am also glad to accept his
explanation of why he told me
three times that he had never
heard about my case or my

resignation. As he told several '

of us. he did not necessarily
“tell everything he knew,” once
he realized what I was calling
about. Of course. I accept this
explanation, likewise, without
question.
in my own behalf, however,

1 feel | must say—for myself

and for my friends who also

heard our conversation—that

if Dr. Hendrix had said he did
not wish to discuss the mat-
ter or simply used the old

phrase, “No comment,” we
would not have been led as-
tray.

I"think I should add, in fair-
ness to the reporters on THE
DAVIDSONIAN — Tom Loflin
and Charles Dibble—that, ex,
cept for the confusion over the
words name and case (for which
I assume full responsibility), the
essential accuracy of my ac-
count of the conversation with
Dr. Hendrix has not. been ques-
tioned by either of us.

Troffer, Chumbley
Dear Editor:

The air is finally settling over
the reeent crisis here at David-
son. As individuals rather in-
timately connected with the re-
cent events, we wish to sum up
at this time our present feelings
on the matter:

We wish to retract any re-
flections on the personal char-
acter of the President and
Dean of Faculty that we have
made.

We regret sincerely the tone
and method we used during the
controversy.

We continue to believe that
the creative aspects of a liber-
at arts education are not re-
ceiving proper emphasis at
Davidson.

We believe that the issues
could have been resolved or at
least clarified had there been
an opportunity to discuss them
at a proper forum.

We wish to express our regret
at the loss to the college of Dr.
Goodykoontz and the circum.
stances surrounding that loss.

We would like to go on record
in saying that Davidson has a
great and unique potential a-
mong schools of its size, and it
has the chance to reach a posi-
tion of preeminence. We have
acted because of our belief in
the school, and we wish here io

indicate our desire to work for

the realization of this potential.
