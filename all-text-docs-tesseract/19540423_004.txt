Camera Club Exhibit
In Lobby of Chambers

As its contribution to the Fine
Arts Festival, the Davidson Col-
Jege Camera Club has secured an
exhibit of contemporary photo-
graphs from Mr. Ernie Shaw of
Holly Smith’s Camera Store and
other members of the Charlotte
Camera Club. Mr. Shaw, who is
active in local photographic cir-
cles, recently won a first place
awarded in the exhibit at the
Photography Short Course held at
Chapel Hill.

The exhibit will remain on dis-
play in the corridor of Chambers
Building through the month of
April.

Government service. If it is de-
cided that anyone who has ever
held Communist sympathies is in-
eligible for Government service,
then we will undoubtedly be doing
ourselves out of a wealth of talent

for important Government jobs.
Precedent Also Important
The precedent which the coming
decision will establish is
portant, too. For if it is decided
that what a man thought or did
two decades ago—even though he
has evidently reputiated his old
sympathies and associations now—
should be held against him, the
effect which such a decision would
establish could very well deprive
us of valuable talent in the future.

dangerous to America in future
decades; but the person who might

The Davidson nine travels to
Greensboro next Tuesday for an-
other contest with a North State
Conference team. They will meet
the Guilford baseballers, and the
Wildeats will be trying for the
first win over the Quakers this
year. During the basketball cam-
paign, Guilford was the winner of
a lone contest.

ATTENTION !

Work has begun on the reno-
vation of the Negro Community
Center which is being financed
by the YMCA Gift Fund. Stu-
dbnts participated in preparing
the building to be moved to
its present location, and dur-
ing the next few weeks addi-
tional student labor will be
needed for such jobs as dig-
ging ditches and painting the
building. Anyone wishing to
volunteer his services should
epply to the Y office.

Sigma Phi Epsi-

heiraer lies must arrive at some
sort of formula by which to judge
future cases of this type, for this
will surely not be the last time
such a case comes up. It seems
imperative that such a formula
should include at least one or both
of the following considerations:

Two Criteria

(1) Can it be established—at
least within reasonable doubt that
the person involved has not had
a change of heart from his former
sympathies, and/or repudiated his
former associations?

(2) Does the person's opinion or
stand on the issue in question—
merely because it happens to co-
incide with the current Russian
viewpoint—necessarily mean that
he still has subversive sympathies
and beliefs. For instance might it
not truly be that Dr. Oppenheimer
opposed the construction of the
hydrogen bomb purely on moral
grounds?

The only encouraging aspect of
the situation is that whatever the
Gray committee decides to do, the
decision made will be a rational
and carefully considered one, not
dictated by demagoguery or politi-
cal aspirations as it might easily
have been if certain other Govern-
ment officials had gotten hold of
the case.

If we should repeal all the regu-
latory laws on our statute books
and enforce only the Ten Com-
mandments, in ten years we would
become the most law-abiding na-
tion on carth.—_James R. Page.

The other one act play is
Eugene O’Neill’s “Where the Cross

cerning the efforts of a young man
to free himself from the influence
of an insane father. Ed Hadley has

Bob Mims is serving as director
and Bob Rhodes is production man-

For the first time in several
years the Masquers will present
plays in the round. This method,
which will be used for both plays,
has the audience on all sides of
the playing area and only a few
feet away from the actors. Pre-
sentation in the round is much
more intimate and effective than
that given on an ordinary stoge.
