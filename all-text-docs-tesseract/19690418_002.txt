About Self-Righteousness

A growing absolutism is devétop-
Ing In issues both nationwide and
tampuswide. an abselitiam which is
explozive because of the patnrization
of sides and moralization of ismiws
aul of which it grows. -

Characteristic of the phenomenon
is the transformation of an issue itito
a cause, a question into an answer.
No longer are there two sides to be
compromised. Instead, it is the good
guys against the bad guys. and the
good guys must win and win com-
pletely. Meditation becomes com-
promise with evil, which is an alto-
gether different matter.

‘Nationally, the issue is best exemp-
lified by the Civil Rights movement,
a cause which has produced passion-
ate beliefs on each side that the other
side is either reactionary or subver-
sive and communist-inspired.

Locally, the same phenomenon sur-
rounds the voluntary ROTC issue, and
THE DAVIDSONIAN has itself pro-
claimed the ethical side of the ROTC
issue.

if one takes the moral side of
things. then he will assume himself
to be right: not just better informed,
or expressing better judgment: but
positively, absolutely right. Moral ar-
guments by their very nature carry
with them this tendency to absolutize

theinselees,

It would be foolish to disagree with
the seriousness with which people
are inking the cthics of the issues
how current, for it is indectd hearten-
ing 19 see apathy diminish. On. the
other hand. jt seems unwise not to
understand the implications af this
phenomenon and lo consider poss-
ible consequences.

The consequences center around
the means those convinced of their
moral righteousness will use to
achieve fulfillment of their cause,
Almost any means is justifiable as
Yong'as the end is right and mora!
and just and good.

But what may well be overlooked
is the limitedness of being human,
the impossibility that any man will
ever ultimately know right from.
wrong. |

Please do not misinterpret this,

‘We are not saying that it is the issués
which we doubt. for with al] the
reason and rationalization we -can
summon, we can’t see how: the Civil
Rights movement is wrong or manda-
tory ROTC is right.

What we do doubt is ourselves, and
for that matter, everyone else. It is
our own self-righteousness and that
of our fellow students that we fear . .

And wish to warn against.

Letter From The Editors

Judging from the barrage of com-
ments which have buried the offices
of THE DAVEDSONIAN with scorn,
we need to make a policy statement
regarding our acceptance of letters
to the editor.

A particular letter in last week’s
“§ssue invoked the ire of a large part
of the college community. Adverse
comments have been directed at the
paper for printing the letter, and we
would like to clarify our stand.

The letter in question misinterpre-
ted a statement by a member of the
administration and ventured into a
personal attack on that person.

We must defend the letter writer's
freedom to make the interpretation
he made, and although we did not
agree with the letter’s content or im-
plications. we printed it because it did
not violate our policy regarding let-
ters,

Now, however, we have decided
fo restate that policy.

We will still accept letters regard-
less of content, provided they don't

step beyond the lines of good taste.
It is this “good taste” which merits
definition. . .

We still reserve the right to refuse
to print letters of an obscene or li-
belous nature, just as we have in the
past.

However, we feel that we also
should not print letters which consti-
tute personal attacks. Such attacks
are in most cases both unjustified and
in bad taste, and we reserve the right
to request revision of such letters.

This is not to say that the editors
are initiating a censorship campaign
on letters to the editor. We value the
column because it remains the one
place on campus where there is free
expression in public. We still main-
tain are Voltarian defense of the
reader's right to express his opinions,
and we will bend over backwards to
print every letter we can.

What the policy does say, however,
is that the editors consider personal
attacks both unwise and unnecessary
and will not accept such attacks in
the future.

AWOL In Nixon Country

By College Press Service

Around the country the California
iawn. of Whittier is bes} known for
fis “favorite son,” Richard Nixon. But
in Army and Marine bases on the
West Const its most redeeming fea-
ture fs the local Unitarian Chureh. In
the past three weeks alone. no fewer
than four AWOL servicemen have
sought and yvained sanctuary there.

In mid-March a voung Marine. Craig
Murphy of Miami. Pla., who was sta-
tioned al nearby Camp Pendleton. ap-
plied,at the church for sanctuary from

he military He said he would sub-
jéc1 himself to arrest, offer no phiysi-
cal resistance: but he wanted to make
known his views on the war and the
railitary in general—views he equld
not make public from his base.

The board of trustees of the charch
franted sanctuary, citing their respect
for “freedom of conscience and the
right to dissent.” For 10 days Murphy
lived in the church. while townspeo-
nile and local college students kept
him company. As agreed, the Shore
Patrol in the area was notified that
he was there and that he would not
resist arrest.

At 2 am. on March 20 (ihe 10th
day), two Marines from Murphy's
base, wearlng civilian clothes. broke
info the church and asked to see the
AWOL Marine alone. While one of
them kent the crowd occupied in one
room, the other beat Murphy and
dragged him outside and into the back
saat of their waiting car, The car gat
awav, but was stopped almost im-
mediately by police for a traffie vio-
tation. Police freed the two Marines—
one a sergeant—and turned Murphy
aver to authorities, who promptly put
him in the brig.

But the saga didn't end there. A
Marine medic named Robert Hambur-
#er, who examined the bruises Murphy
pot in his beating, was so shocked he
went AWOL, loo, saying he must take
a stand against the Marines’ stifling
of dissent. The Unitarian church gave
Hamburger sanctuary.

Word spreads fast on the AWOL
underground and through the press;

and Jack Lunford, a Marine who had
been AWOI. in Seatile for seven
months, flew to Whittler to take Mur-
phy’s place in the sanctuary when he
heard about the beating.

Whittier is beginning to look preity
good to AWOL servicemen: another
is David Jones of McCulloch, Ark.,
who had been AWOL once before,
courtmartialed and thrown in the brig.
But Whittier is nieer than the brig,
30 Jones, along with two of his guards,
escaped from his base and gained
sanctuary there.

The “Whittier three” remain in
the church, visited by a constant flow
of people 24 hours a day. The church
has not set a quota on AWOL service-
men, although it is obvious that the
church's activities have been altered
a great deal by their presence. Relig-
ious services are held daily. featuring
different religions each day. A seder
was celebrated at Passover, and the
follawing weekend Bishop Pames Pike
held a service.

The church’s policy fs to inform the
Shore Patro] sbout the servicemen in
sanctuary, and invite them to come
if they wish. So far they have refused
the invitation. .

Pastor Richard Weston js surprised
by the lack of adverse reaction to the
sanctuary in this southern California
town. Press coverage has been fair,
and in general. he says, theré ‘is sup-
port among townspeople. “They hav-
en't bombed us yet," he adds.

Weston goes to ihe brig at Camp
Pendleton to visit Murphy regularly,
On the way out, he flashes the peace
sign to passing Marines. “Puily half
the soldiers T pass Mash it back— and
it's quite obvious from their expres-
sions What they mean. I'm surprised
at how large the underground tn the
Marines is,” he adds.

The tawn's most notable product—
now in Washington—is suppesedly ine
formed of what goes in Whittier. Two
Congressmen fron: the area have ask-
ed the Pentagon for an investigation
nf the original Murphy beating.

It seems going WOL in Nixon
country {s the noxt test thing to
having Nixon go AWOL himself.

The ‘Action Gap’

There are times when we need to reexamine our
perspectives. We may tell ourselves that we have
done so or that we continue to do so. But then some-
one comes along to challenge that self-satisfaction.

The praesent college generation, like others before
it, has taken the greatest delight in childing the
powers that be — spotting inconsistencies and fail-
ures with relish. In fact, this generation has probably
had a greater effect on domestic and world affairs
than any before it.

That’s a source of pride.

What isn’t praiseworthy is what
an older person pointed out lo a
Juncheon audience of college stu-
dents recently: that while students
have hecome more and more criti-
cal of institutions and of those

ay people in the society who wield
oo power, those same students have
NT % of late talked themselves into a

: » sort of societal voyeurism. a ration-

alized opting out.

There is an unspoken attitude which seems to
say that it is enough to know about the problems and
to suffer under thought of their painfulness. And here
the process stops. Acceptance of insolubility. Ac
ceptance of unacceptables,

For some this practiced disillusionment becomes
alienation; others move toward narcissism. Still others
move toward what author Paul Zweig has called a
new narcisissism in which the individual struggles
bitterly against authority — the bitterness of tre
agitation resulting in more self-loathing than self-
ove.

, some of the more violent protests the nation
has seen over the past two years include what ap-
pears to be a strong masochistic impulse operating
behind other announced motivations. The question
has been raised whether for some young radicals the
violence itsclf was a source of satisfaction to them,
regerdiess of achievement of certain stated abjec-
tives.

All this conjecture may be completely off base.
But what stands out is that regardless of reasons, re-
gardless of armchair psychoanalysis. the present stu-
dent generation is becoming the functional equivalent
of the older generation it has so thoroughly damned.

__ Our generation has long condemned the genera-
tions preceding us.as apathetic, unconcerned. insen-
sitive to human problems. But now we show signs of
the same inactivity, the same functional failures.
excusing ourselves on grounds of disillusionment and
acceptance of the inevitability of all those things we
say we dislike most in our society,

Without going through a litany of current prob-
lems, the obvious fact of the present situation is that
unless man curbs his excesses he may lose the whole
operation. Not to recognize this is folly. To recognize
it and remain inactive is failure. To explain the failure
is not to remove it.

Evon more valueless than this defeatist with-
drawal is the capacity for complete forgetfulness some
members of the present student generation have cul-
tivated. Incredible as it may seem to men of this
institution, some of their contemporaries have yet
to even be personally touched by the problems.

They recognize no obligation of intelligence and
education. They feel no responsibility.

For some, it can be said with fairness, self-in-
dulgence is a way of life,

“Big party weekends can he fun,” the luncheon
speaker concluded, “Though after a while they may
become quite vapid. 1 wonder how many of your f{ra-
ternity friends know just how fragile the fabric that
supports such things is. I wonder if they know how
precariously this whole nation is perched.”

Maybe the generation gap is not the major divi-
sion. Maybe the gap between those who act and those
who don’t act is the major dividing Mne: an inactive,
disillusioned 21-year-old is no more effective than
an inactive, apathatic 50-year-old.
