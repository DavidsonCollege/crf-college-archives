THE

DAVIDSONIAN, MAY 12, 1927

NEW YORKER WINNER OVER
STORY WRITERS

Cornell Wooltich, twenty-one years old
and a resident of New York City, has
been awarded the first prize of $10,000
for the best’ story submitted in the com-
petition recently conducted by College
Humor and First National Pictures. Both
the established. and unknown writer en-
tered work on an equal footing, although
the tyro especially was‘urged to enter.
The contest closed February 1, 1927, and
thousands of manuscripts were consider-
ed.

Either a short story, a novelette or
novel was eligible to win the prize. “Chil-
dren of the Ritz,” by Cornell Woolrich,
is a full length novel. It will appear in

College Humor beginning with the Aug- |

ust issue. Following, that, Boni &
Liveright will issue it in book form, and
First National Pictures will make a fea-
ture photoplay of it. Much critical at-
tention will be turned upon it, and it is
almost certain to establish the writing
reputation of young Woolrich.

It was particularly gratifying to offi-
"eials of the magazine and film corpora-
tions to know that a young writer had
done the trick. His ironic romance, laid
in New York and smart Long Island, is
delightfully paced; it is the story of a
wealthy girl who married a poor boy and
pulled down on her head an avalanche of
newspaper publicity. The theme is the
difficulty of marrying happily out of your
own class because of different traditions
and background.

Concerning himself the author has this
to say: “I was twenty-one last Decem-
ber, which means I was born in 1906—for
no good purpose.;» Most likely I was
God’s gift to the Gibson girl, only the
Gibson girl didn’t know it. I was a baby
for some time, until finally I began to
get ideas of my own. One of these ideas
had to do with my hair; I didn’t like the
way it was cut. I wanted a boy’s haircut
or I wouldn’t play. It was my hair and I
was going to do what I wanted with it.
To cure me they took me down to Mexi-
co, where haircuts are haircuts (witness
the Chihuahua species.)

“T was eight when I got there, and I
saw bullfights, jumping beéans,, and the
marines in Vera Cruz. When the Ma-
rines went home I forgot my slang I
picked up once in a while, and our Fifth
Avenue busses on Prado (with American
advertisements still’ inside the racks),
You'd be surprised how slick those busses
can look when you’ve been away for
age.

mas, but not too hard—they bruise so
