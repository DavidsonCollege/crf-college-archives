THE NEWS AND EDITORIAL VOICE OF DAVIDSON COLLEGE

FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 23, 1962

(All Unsigned Editorials by the Editor)

The Trustees-Quiet

The mid-term meeting of the
trustees was short and quiet but not
uneventful. Action on the most im-
portant and pressing question was
the quietest. The petitions of the fac-
ulty and students to open Davidson
admissions to qualified men of all
races and nationalities was referred
to the Executive Committee.

We are naturally disappointed
that no more positive action was
taken. If the trustees are merely
dragging their feet at a time when
Davidson should be seizing the leader-
ship in the South. the move is even
more regrettable. But if sending the
problem to the Executive Committee
reflects a serious desire for objective
and progressive consideration. of .an
issue which is of great importance ‘to
us, it is certainly understandable:

Indeed, we look with hope to the
committee in its study of the integra-
tion problem. Had the. faculty-stud-
ent votes been sent to the committee
which previously studied .the question.
they would have probably sent back
the same opinion. that integration
was not in Davidson's ‘‘best interest.”

Perhaps we can expect new pro-
gress from a new committee. By giv-
ing the issue to this leading group
among the trustees for consideration,
they have shown that they are quite
serious in searching for a real solu-
tion to the problem. The Executive
Committee has in its hands not only
the behest of the students and faculty
but Christianity’s moral mandate. The
vear is not yet finished. Can we hope
for progress in May?

lf integration indecision will
bring reactions from many students,
the raise in room rent and the gen-
eral fee will leave an empty feeling in.

every student’s pocket on campus.
The sad truth is, of course, that if
we want to compete with other col-
leges of our kind in the South and
nation, we must have the money to do
it. This adjustment in fees brings
Davidson’s price in line with that of

most other institutions in the South.

There is a great danger in such
an increase in the cost of a Davidson
education. We have already become a
one-class school to too great an ex-
tent. With this change a part of our
vitality seems to have been drained
away. We asked one of the trustees
why the ’30s seem to have produced
so many outstanding alumni, his an-
swer—the Depression. It was a hard
school but a good one.”

The trustees acknowledged that
a qualified man should not be pre-
vented from attending Davidson be-
cause of lack of funds. The new rates
make it more difficult, however. The
raise in prices was necessary. Now
the time is ripe for the study of fur-
ther scholarship and job opportuni-
ties and even more basic solutions to
the problem such as’ the graduated
scale of rates employed by some
schools whereby wealthier students
pay more and poorer ones less.

Finally, the investigation of the
Piedmont University Center which
the trustees okayed ‘may prove to bé
of great interest to Davidson in the
future. As the exact nature of the
program becomes clearer and more
facts are available, we will be able to
examine the idea in future editorial
comment. At the present, the trustee
go-ahead is merely a vote of confi-.
dence in the judgment of the admin-
istration in the investigation of the
Center

Needed: A Dynamic IFC

The IFC this week has come in
for its share of criticism from a num-
ber of students. But the most con-
structive comments came from Sigma
Nu President Bob. Phillips. He pre-
sented to the fraternity pfesidents
and to the IFC a plan for reorganiza-
tion which shows some original
thought. (See story on page one).

It is our opinion, however, that
Phillips’s plan has approached the
problem of IFC weakness from the
wrong side. He has chosen to strength-
en the IFC by injecting leadership
from the fraternity presidents’ organ-
ization—the wrong source.

We, too, see many problems in
present IFC organization. Its prime
function should be to represent the
combined fraternities in. all college
affairs. To do this, it needs the sup-
port of all fraternity men and all
chapter. officers. Unfortunately most
chapters -have elected men to the
council without due thought to this
need. Since the presidency is con-
sidered something of a political plum,
too many men have been elected to
the IFC with only this office in mind.

Since IFC reorganization is now
up for consideration, we would like to
make the following suggestions. First,
the IFC presidency should be made
an elective office to which all frater-
nity rising seniors are eligible, and for
which all fraternity men may vote..
Only after the election of the presi-

dent from the fraternity system at
large would individual chapters
choose their representatives.

All 12 fraternities would elect a
voting representative, including the
fraternity of which the president was
a member. The president would have
no vote. The independents should of
course, continue to choose a non-vot-
ing social representative. If necessary,
a rule could provide that no fraternity
could have the office for two consecu-
tive years. It might also be wise to
require IFC representatives to be
members of the junior and senior
classes.

We very much favor Phillips's
plan to give investigative functions.
to the students themselves. We don’t
feel, however, that it is necessary for
the fraternity presidents to be forced
to carry this extra load. If the IFC
were truly a “dynamic organization”
it could carry this function itself.
Because, however, the faculty and the
Student body saw the IFC baffled by
Sophomore Rush and other controver-
sies last year, there has been no de-
Sire to give it strong regulatory
powers.

A change of attitude toward the
IFC is needed. Let the fraternity presi-
dents go back to their chapter re-
sponsibilities. Revamp the IFC to
make it “a dynamic organization with
dynamic leadership.” DBS

A Ray Of Sunshine

“Don’t apologize for the fog,”
Dean Rusk, ’31, Secretary of State,
said in reference to our usually inhos-
pitable weather. “I will deliberately
try to add to it.”

But if the skies were overcast for
the celebrated return of our present-
ly most illustrious alumnus, every-
thing else was bright. From the mes-
sages he delivered, both on and off
the record, to his steps back into the
past, he left us with a warm feeling
of pride and nostalgia.

Indeed he did much to lift the fog
from our minds about this difficult
problem of foreign diplomacy. If
learning does arise from confusion, as

the Secretary indicated, then he pro-
vided the learning after a series of
visitors, well below his stature and
wisdom, has earlier brought the cam-
pus confusion.

And his hopeful note of optimism
last night was a welcome relief to the
dismal picture to which we are ac-
customed. This is a man who cherishes
deeply the goals set forth in the
United Nations Charter and he directs
his every action as head of our state
department toward their realization.

Davidson can be justly proud of
Dean Rusk. “It’s good to be back,”
he kept reminding us. It was good to
have you, Mr. Secretary. The pleasure
was all ours.

Free Trade Is Keynote Of Secretary's Address

BY THE HON. DEAN RUSK
Secretery of State
(Editor's Note: The following
are excerpts from «a speech
given Wednesday to the Char-
lotte Chamber of Commerce.)

I should like to speak of two
proposed legislative measures
that are essential if the United
States is to fulfill the role which
history has trust upon it—the
role of a strong and wise lead-
er of the Free World...

One of these measures is con-
cerned with expanding trade
among Free World nations; the
other with providing the re-
sources of capital and exper-
ience to enable the less-develop-
ed nations to maintain political
independence and achieve a
more nearly adequate levél of
life...

The European Economic Com-
munity, or Common Market, is
bringing together by their own
voluntary act millions of gifted
and resourceful people com-
manding vast resources of skill
and productive capacity ...
In the curious new physics of
political unity the whole not
only can be, but almost always
is, greater than the sum of its
parts... The emergence of the
Community means that we shall
have on the two sides of the
Atlantic Ocean two immense
trading areas, two common
markets, ‘so to speak: the com-
mon market of the United
States and the Common Market
of Europe.

After all, the European Com-
mon Market is in many ways
tailor-made for our type of in-

dustrial enterprise. We are the
only industrial nation of the
Free World that has developed
its industrial plant and its in-
dustrial techniques to serve a
great mass market...

° vigor .

We shall have to apply our
genius for distribution, for
merchandising, to an entirely
new market and shall have to
learn to deal with habits and
tastes different from those of
America...

The Trade Expansion Act of
1962 is the instrument which
the President will need in order
to achieve this result. It would
authorize the gradual climina-
tion of tariffs by the United
States in return for concessions
by the EEC on those products
in which the United States and
the EEC together supply 80%
of world trade — products in
which we have shown we can
compete ... Our own industries
— which now employ some 3
million workers directly pro-
ducing for export — will have
access to growing markets...

On the one hand, we cannot
allow the future of the free
world — and this is what is at
stake — to bo forfeited for a
small minority. On the other,
we cannot callously stand by
while this "minority is injured.
It need not be. In the case of
an industry very important to
you in North Carolina, cotton
textiles, we were able ‘to nego
tiate an agreement with major
importing and exporting coun-
tries to ease the problem .
Such trade adjustment assist-
ance is provided for under the

new Trade Expansion Act...

It will open important new
markets for our products a-
broad, and increased trade will
give our economy added
. . And certainly there
can be no question but that the
lowering of trade barriers will
go far to ensure that 180 mil-
lion American consumers will
obtain the best quality and wid-
est varieties of goods at prices
derived from vigorous compe-
tition.

+

We have been coming to the
aid of our hard-pressed fellows
on a scale unprecedented in
human history ... We were in-
spired, if by nothing else, by a
realization that the exigencies
of the mid-twentieth century
left us no choice but to do what
we could to bring a decent
world order into being ....

First, we know that our loans
or grants to another country
can be no more than the extra,
if critical, push . . . Economie
and social development cannot
be exported from one country
{o another. The main drive and
the basic resources must come
from within the country itself.

We attach the greatest im-
portance to the movement of
the OECD countries toward ap-
propriating approximately 1%
of Gross National Product com-
mitted to aid for underdevelop-
ed countries...

it is a matter of some import.

tries which have become inde-

Dear Editor:

At the risk of being number-
ed in the “God Squad" and
bringing the further wrath of
the Scripts ‘N Pranks upon this
paper I want to comment upon
the editorial ethics of the edi-
torial staff of the Sripts ‘N
Pranks.

First, I must praise highly all
items except “Gentlemanius
Davidsonius” and “Handbook
for Davidson Dates.” While
“Gentlemanius Davidsonius” is
the sub-cultural level of humor
that one might expect from
such a publication, there is no
excuse for the gross vulgarity
to be found in “Handbook for
Davidson D&tes.”

TASTE QUESTIONED

The editorial board showed
very bad taste in allowing this
trash to be printed, Had this
been only my own view I might
not have written this. But sev-

eral other persons said to me‘

An Investigation Uncovers
Campus Subversive Group

BY BILL HAGEN
Davidsonian Managing Editor

The American press has recently devoted much of
its valuable space to the so-called “rise of the Right.”
The alarm has been spread to watch out for these loyal
pink-eyed bears prematurely woken from hibernation.

The reasoning behind it all is, of course, that if you
can’t be out there on the front lines manning a machine
gun (or in your fall-out shelter) the least you can do is
to jump from foxhole to foxhole and grab the dangerous
men who would wait till they were sure it was the enemy
before they shot, This strengthens morale.

RAMPANT

RADICALS

Reading some of. the latest reward notices in the
local paper the other day, it suddenly occurred to me
that surely Davidson, being the hotbed of radicals that
it is, must have some underground organization that we
can proudly claim as our own. And we have!

Right on this campus we have agents of an organiza.
tion going about spreading its doctrine. Right in the
radical middle there is an active cell named SAME (The
Committee For A Same Musical Policy).

ROCKER ARGUES

Jim R. Rocker, the man behind the machine, has a
Strong mind. He is strongly for rock ’n roll, pops, and
other music-in-general but is strongly against the more
“esoteric” forms. As Mr Rocker says, “The society don’t
cotten to much of that stuff Left of Big Maybelle.”

Rocker lashed out at the many critics of the recent
dance weekend music. “They’re using Good Taste as
another excuse for sour grapes. Besides, if the guys
don’t like rock ’n roll, why did they come to Davidson?”

MUSIC SAFEGUARDS

When questioned about the Twist, Rocker cried,
“Why it is the best example of the clear set of ethical
standards we have here. Have you ever tried to make-out
with someone when you were coming up for air?”

His comment on ‘sing-alongs’ was “They’re great!
My only qualm about Mitch Miller is that his songs aren‘t

selected by a majority vote.

“The music we embrace is American Music—that
common music that everyone can understand and partici-
pate in. It is necessary! The minute you start program-
ming any type of music some people can’t understand

and feel, it is dangerous!

TYRANNY DANGER

“Why this could eventually lead to such a narrow
and codified thing that an elite group could get ahold of
it and create a tyranny, usurping the rights of the musical
individual. This is why I would like to see Leonard Bern-
stein investigated by a committee of Gallup pollsters.”
As time was short, I couldn’t ask him what he intended
doing with the rest of the New York Philharmonic.

When questioned about his future Rocker thought
he might run for President of the IFC since “although
most of their programs have been up to par, they have
let some questionable elements slip through.”

He concluded, “I will run on a ‘Right or no, status

quo’ ticket.”

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Magazine’s Editorial Ethics Criticized

read by their dates.

It misrepresented a large part
of the student body and was a
disgrace to the college. While
I do not expect Puritan morals
of the staff, I at least expect

‘them to have the intelligence

to determine what type of hu-
mor is acceptable in what type
of company.

Dear Editor:

People have asked me wheth.
er Britain is doing anything
about entering the space race
and here is my reply. Going
alone into the space race is now
apparently out of the question
as Britian lacks the vast finan-
cial resources available in this
country for development.

Perhaps we could afford it if
we really tried but I would
much sooner sacrifice some
national prestige and have the
money spent improving the lot
of the lower classes. Grandma

would much prefer to see her
pension increased than satel-
lites in the sky. However don’t
misunderstand me here.

CO-OP ROCKET

The question is not whether
we should go into the space
race but rather whether we
should go it alone. What in fact
Britain has done is to join ‘The
Space Club’ and a three-stage
rocket launcher is being con-
structed. The first stage is be-
ing built by Britain, the sec.
ond by France, and the third by
West Germany.

The rocket would be tested at
Woomera, Australia where we
already have well established
facilities, including radar and
optical tracking stations. Britain
also has plans for the develop-
ment of a worldwide satellite
communications system which
it is thought will pay for itself
after about ten years.

DIFFICULTIES ASSUMED

Looking back I am naturally
a trifle sceptical about British,
French and German scientists,

speaking different languages
and using different units, being
able to cooperate on a rocket
project as mentioned above.
Even assuming they could, the
problem is far from solved as
the politicians would step in.
_ And you know as well as I
do that it only takes one person
like De Gaulle to render the
situation pregnant with possi-
bilities for disagreement. But
don’t despair! I'm sure one day
British, French and Germans
will be able to get together on
common ground .... in space!

Dear Editor:

This time last week, instead
of enjoying the luxury of the
“female presence,” I was sick
abed with the flu. Yet the con.
ditions at Preyer Infirmary
went a long way to compensate
for the aforementioned sacri.
fice.

(IT ALWAYS SEEMS SO GUET AROUND
HERE ON THE DAY HE GOES To
VISIT_HIS GRANDFATHER...

The Infirmary is sweet relief
from the hectic world that con-
stantly churns less than a hun-
dred feet away. The inner sanc-
tum of that building spares its
occupants some of the noise and
rush which is college normalcy.

NURSES COMPLIMENTED

Another factor contributing
to the restful atmosphere is the
800d food. The meals are fresh-
ly cooked in small quantities so
that the kitchen need not sacri-
fice the quality of its product.

The final, but most important,
praiseworthy aspect of the In-
firmary is its nursing staff. The
hurses are all kind and consid-
erate. I wish most highly to
compliment Mrs. Johnston. Her
cheer, eagerness to please, and
Outgoing generosity made my
sojourn in the Infirmary a
nearly enviable stay.

HARD BEDS

The staff is apologetic about
one thing only, and rightfully:
the poor beds in its upstairs
ward. While I was there the
ridiculously weak springs were
strengthened with six-foot ply-
wood boards. This created the
other extreme in the degree of
softness.

The Infirmary needs new
beds. The staff knows it. The
patients know it! Does the ad-
ministration know it?
