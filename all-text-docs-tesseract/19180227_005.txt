A NEED.

The exercises and ceremonies held by
‘the Davidson Battalion on Washington's
Birthday, while very good, all things be-
ing considered, were lacking in one thing
that would have greatly increased the
impressiveness and spirit—and that is a
band. A need for such an organization
has been felt at Davidson in the past.
and short-lived efforts have been made to
have one. but for one reason or another
they never materialized. But now that
Davidson has military training, the need
is felt more than ever, and a band would
be an important and useful addition to
our military organization. Of course, a
band of many pieces could not be raised
here with the limited number of students
but a small band could, or at least a
bugle and drum corps. Cannot some ot
the musicians of Davidson “get their
heads together” and perfect: some such
organization, so that on the next occasion
the battalion makes a public appearance.
and there will be other times this spring.
an even better showing can be made?

In the New York Evening Post, Mr.
William Allen White has published an
article entitled “Why Doesn’t the Gov-
ernment Do It?” ‘This, he says. is the
question which most frequently meets a
solicitor for Red Cross funds. Con-
sidering Red Cross in terms of socks, and
sweaters, chloroform and sweet-faced
nurses, it might be done. But this is a
small part of the Red Cross work.
Naturally it would increase taxes, and
put into politics something that is high
and beautiful in life. But could the
Government look after families of sol-
diers? Could it spend millions of dol-
lars on canteens, where weary soldiers
coming back from the trenches have’
lodging, bath and food, sympathy and
kind words—could it? In less than a
week after the Italian breakdown, the
American Red Cross was distributing

that this government could pay.

for the joy they feel in helping their fel-

low men, these experts are doing this

work for the American Red Cross.
These men and women feel that they
are not tied up by Federal red tape.
They feel that no party is taking credit

for their work, to use that credit in win-

ning elections. So, as free, unfettered

American citizens they are giving their

whole lives and strength to this Red
Cross work, working sometimes all day
and all night in emergencies; and they

know that there are no rewards, no pro-
motions, no glory, no mention in the

newspapers—nothing but jovous service
and sacrifices and the exaltation that
comes from seeing one’s work grow un-
der one’s hand and bear fruit.

Every man or woman who out of his

own. heart here at home gives to support
the Red Cross is helping our cause from
an angle of attack that is new in modern
war. It is the angle of brotherhood.
Tr stiffens the courage of the civilians.
Tt puts heart into our soldier allies by
the comforting knowledge that their
home affairs are going well. And every
dollar put into the Red Cross makes not
only for victory in this war, but for
everlasting peace between the great na-
tions now fighting together in this war.

We are in the business of summoning
the resources of the greatest nation on
earth in the purest mission that a nation
ever espoused. Our factories become
busy; our young men register; and our
armies become trained, and we under-
take our share in this conflict. Not to
add a square inch to the territory of the
United States; not to take from any
man, woman or child in the world a sin-
gle thing which belongs to them: not
even for the glory of successful arms:
but in order to re-establish those princi-
ples of national justice without which
national continuance and life cannot pre-
vail. and to give ‘to the stricken people
of the world who have been fighting for
the right. rest and respite to rehabilitate
their almost destroyed civilization —

The war is to be a supreme test. We
are to test the fibre of our people; we
are to test our ability to co-operate: we
are to test our sense of nationalism, we
are to test our loyalty to Democracy;

we are to test to the ultimate the re-

sources of our nation, the capacity of our

mines and miners, of our farms and
farmers, of our mills and mill hands.
We are to test our own vision and the
greatness of our awn minds—whether

we are worthy of a large future or

wedded to a little life; we are to test our
own conception of this country and its
relation to the world. And we shall not
fail—Franklin K. Lane.

A start has been made towards beauti-
