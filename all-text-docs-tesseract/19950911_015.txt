V-ball beats Campbell

By MICHAEL KRUSE

On Saturday, the volleyball
team - welcomed the pesky
Campbell Camels to Belk Arena
for a 7 p.m. start.

VOLLEYBALL

Nearly three hours and tre-
mendous amounts of effort and
heart later, the Wildcats emerged
with a gutsy 3-2 victory, 14-16,
15-17, 15-13, 15-10, 18-16.:

In the first game, Davidson
(2-4) found themselves quickly
down, 7-2 and 11-4. The team then
closed the gap to 11-9 and 13-12,
finally knotting the contest at 14
points apiece.

This scrappy, come-from-be-
hind style of play became the Wild-
cats’ common theme for the rest of
the match.

Butthe Camels ultimately cap-
tured the initial game and once
again jumped out to an early lead,
4-0 in the second game, only to see
the Wildcats come back to tie it 5-
5.

A see-saw battle ensued until
Davidson reached game point at
15-14. Unable to capitalize, the
Wildcats saw their opportunity dis-
appear and within minutes, dropped
a second game, 17-15.

An already bleak scenario be-
came even worse, as Davidson fell
hopelessly behind in the third game,
11-3.

Having played too well to suc-
cumb in three consecutive games,
they slowly, but surely clawed their
way back, cutting the deficit to 11-
6, 12-9 and then 13-12.

There, freshman outside hit-
ter Emily Willeford took control
and served out the crucial middle
game 15-13.

In the fourth game, Campbell
took a 6-1 lead, but as usual, the
determined Davidson squad fought
back to win it 15-10, sending the
marathon match to a fifth game.

Because of the rally scoring in
the final stanza,, regardless of who
is serving, the score teetered back
and forth.

Davidson had a match point at

14-13, as did Campbell at 15-14.
Another potential winner for the
Wildcats at 16-15 was denied, but
finally, at 17-16, the Wildcats put
an emphatic end to the long match
and won on a powerful cross-court
smash.

Having started the season with
a 1-4record due tolossesto Temple,
N.C. State, South Carolina, and
Illinois-Chicago and a3-1 win over
Winthrop, Saturday night repre-
sented a much-needed emotional
victory for Davidson.

Hopefully, it will serve as-a
stepping stone for the future and,
according to head coach Lisa
Radford, the future for Davidson
volleyball is bright.

As the seventh seed in the
Southern Conference, expectations
are not high for the team, but that
suits Radford just fine, as she an-
ticipates surprising a lot of tal-
ented teams as underdog.

She views this season not as a
rebuilding year, but as “a building
year,” sensing a positive energy on
her young team that boasts only
one senior (captain Michele
Augustin) and a one junior (cap-
tain and defensive setter Ami
Bondurant). The rest of the squad
consists of several wide-eyed fresh-
men and sophomores, many of
whom play integral roles in the
team’s offensive and defensive at-

‘tack.

Led by the two upperclass-
men, sophomores L.A. Bumgarner
at outside hitter and setter Amy
Bourgeois, and freshmen Janet
Duncan (middle blocker) and
Willeford (outside hitter) will also
play key roles this season.

Under her tutelage, Radford
hopes the group can approach a
.500 winning percentage, thus so-
lidifying a spot in the middle of the
conference. The scrappy squad then
aims to go at least one round in the
post-season conference tourney
held here at Davidson in Novem-
ber.

The Wildcats, however, play
an ambitious schedule including
matches against regional power-
houses South Carolina and North
Carolina.

Tough hurdles within the con-

ference are preseason favorites

Furman, Appalachian State and
East Tennessee State.

With sucha demanding gaunt-
let of games, the youthful Wildcats
will have to consistently give “150
percent,” as Radford puts it, play-
ing over their potential to gain a
respectable record.

Radford said that she hopes
Saturday will prove to be indica-
tive of her team’s ability to come
from behind and post intense vic-
tories.

This week’s full slate includes
a trip to Chapel Hill to face the Tar
Heels, while on Wednesday, the
team participates in the Radford
tournament. Davidson then hosts
East Carolina on Friday at 5 p.m.
and Morehead St. and Radford on
Saturday at 11 a.m. and 7:30 p.m.,
respectively.

Field Hockey faces
tough competition
from the start

_ Two weekends ago, the
Davidson field hockey team
opened its season at Virginia, one

\

of the stronger ACC teams and
then faced a tough Miami (Ohio).

This weekend, the Wildcats
stayed home, but still had tough
competition — facing Ohio Uni-
versity and Wake Forest.

The squad lost the first two
games of the season, before falling
to Ohio Saturday and facing the
Deacons, which just knocked off
defending champion James Madi-
son, on Sunday.

Virginia is one of the hardest
opponents on the Wildcats sched-
ule, and Davidson fell 5-0. But
coach Betsy Pryor said the team
did not play poorly.

_ “We played very well in the
second half,” Pryor said. “We did
not embarrass ourselves. With our
tough preseason, I believe we
started off the regular season well.”

The team was riddled by pulled

muscles in the preseason, includ-

ing three to returning starters. Al-
though all were able to play, the
team symmetry was not there yet.
The pulled muscles, coupled with
the late arrival of the freshman,
limited the time the team had played
together.

In the second game against
Miami, these handicaps took their
toll. Although the Wildcats seem-
ingly dominated the game, they
were unable to execute in key scor-
ing situations and fell 2-1.

The Wildcats had many
standout performers, including jun-
ior leftback Mary Dowd and Nicole
Ficeto, both of whom did an excel-
lent job controlling the left side of
the field.

Teresa Allen, Amy
Lamoureux and freshman sweeper
Lindsey Parker all played tough
and contributed to a successful
opening weekend.

Pryorremains optimistic about
the season. With the addition of
assistant coach Sandie Marotti,
who Pryor said has been a great
help already, and the encouraging
performances last weekend, the
field hockey team is ready to tackle
the rest of the season.

This week, the Wildcats have
two home matches, hosting Appa-
lachian State on Thursday and
Longwood on Sunday.

After falling to UNCC 2-0 on
Wednesday, the women’s soccer
team took out their frustrations in
the ring. The American Gladia-
tors ring set up at Lunar Luau

needed before entering a week-
end of competition. It must have
been just what the Wildcats
needed because they dominated
this weekend winning their first
conference game and advancing
to 1-0 in the Southern Confer-
ence.

The team romped Wofford
8-0 on Saturday in a game that
they dominated from the begin-
ning when Melissa Moser scored
on a pass from Claudia Lombard
49 seconds into the game.

The Wildcats never looked
back, After taking only 11 shots
against UNCA and 8 shots against
UNCC, the offensive line got hun-
gry taking 44 shots. At half time
with a comfortable lead of 4-0,
Moser, Kelly Ammann, Lucia

provided the release players

WOMEN’S SOCCER
Wildcats relish two weekend
wins, move to 1-0 in conference

Plosser, and Heather Wineberg
scored off of assists from Lombard,
freshman Rhina Roberts, and
Ammann.

However, the Wildcats didn’t
let up and came out the second half
strong with Plosser scoring unas-
sisted only nine minutes into the
half. Sophomore Amy Kanoff,
freshman Linda Rothemund, and
Wineberg followed her lead scor-
ing off of assists from Plosser,
Lombard and Schmidt, respec-
tively.

Not happy with just one win,
the Wildcats came out ready for
conference play on Sunday and
took it to Georgia Southern. Once
the Wildcats got the lead they never
looked back. Goalie Allison
Noznesky did an excellent job as
well as defenders Shannon
Lowrance, freshman Katherine
Cornelius and Kelly Schmidt of
keeping Georgia Southern’s all
conference players away from the
goal.

Plosser, Wineberg, Ammann,
and Moser scored off of assists
from Lombard, Moser, Cornelius,

and Kanoff in 5-1 victory.

“We have really come to-
gether recently,” said Plosser.
“We have a small team and really
haven’t gotten the chance to play
11 on 11 and that is why the
Wofford game was so good for
us.”

Coach Hundley agreed with
Plosser, “We may only have 15,
but all 15 can play. Both days we
have had a tremendous team ef-
fort.”

The team has been finishing
off their scoring chances and cre-
ating many more opportunities to
score. Freshmen have continued
to improve with playing experi-
ence and contributions-from the
bench have been invaluable.

Inthe past two games Plosser
has come off the bench to score 4
goals andchipinoneassist. Moser
contributed 2 goals and 2 assists
and Wineberg added 3 goals and
an assist in the weekend sweep.

“We have been playing great,
but the next three games are go-
ing to be the hardest. Those will
be the test,” said Plosser.
