The Lyndon by Brien Ri ace Memorial Library
at the University of Texas-Austin has been called the
“Temple at Karnak” because of its grandiose
pretentions. One’s eyes climb six stories of beige
traverline marble before the first windows. appear.
One exhibit pays homage to his sense of humor.
Another. applauds his Great Society. LBJ is not
everyone’s favorite president; some say he kept us in
Vietnam because he held stock in war machine
manufacturing companies. There is some doubt as to
whether he deserves such a heartwarming ($25
million) “thank-you.”

Richard Milhous Nixon graduated from Duke
Law in 1937. Duke President Terry Sanford proposed
earlier this year that the University donate land for his
library.

There may be room for speculation concerning
LBJ, but few can doubt Nixon’s dishonesty. In fact,
just two weeks ago a fresh Nixon-Haldeman
conversation was released in which Nixon suggests
that Teamsters Union “thugs” be sent to “knock the
heads off” hippie peace protesters dancing on the
White House lawn.

Despite a minor revolution from the. school’s
Academic Council opposing any monument to

Nixon, the University’s Board of Trustees decided on °

5 September to go ahead with negotiations for the
library and museum.

The Academic Council rejected “the creation of
any museum or memorial designed to foster the
glorification of the former president.” They are
“concerned at the consequences for our university of
its name becoming inextricably tied to our country’ S
only president forced to resign in disgrace.” .

It is ironic, that the majority of the opposing

faculty members are from the History department. So

these: professors want to,erase Nixon’s records from
public: memory, ‘making . a farce of théir’ own
discipline? Says ‘Larry Goodwyn, History. professor
and one of the leaders of the: opposition, “I don’t
know about you but I'll be amned ifm going to
want tolook up from wherever I am on. campus for the
rest of my life and have ‘to see that thing,” Duke
alumnus William Styron’ (Sophie’ $ Choice) might

prefer that the records bé kept, but just in. some dark
closet instead of Duke; “To establish any c connection, a

. if Nixon were-already dead, much, if not all, of their

opposition.to the library would vanish.” Pinsky asks
us all: “Would you want R.N. sulking around your

neighborhood?”

Not all the faculty, students, and alumni are in
such strong. Opposition to the plan. A petition of

‘faculty suporters was released last Tuesday, signed

by 75 faculty members. “We have no doubt that the
Nixon library. would be a resource of exceptional
value to faculty and. students at Duke and the

~ Research Triangle,” ; said a letter prepared by three

faculty members. Also, according to a recent Duke
University Republicans’ poll, almost 50% of the
Duke students favor the library.

presence.”

Nixon will probably be one of the most studied
of all presidents. He is a tragic figure of both gre;
achievement and failure: There will be some sort 6
archival facility for his study at Duke, but will it be an
austere ash-brick filing cabinet or a Californian Taj
‘Mahal? Will the attractions of Pat’s jewels and Dick’s
vacation slides outweigh the structure’s historical
purpose?

Wayne Field of Minnesota has a suggestion
which he mailed to Duke, the National Archives, and
Nixon’s office. His plans. for the “Nixon Center”
consist of a 5 story pyramid — a 385,000 square foot

“cross between the Hanging Gardens of Babylon and

an Aztec temple, “equipped with 6,400 square feet on
the top floor for ex- -presidential living quarters.

Unfortunately, Field’s plan: will not be-taken any
