An Edueated Bookstore

President Spencer’s announcement
this week of a committee to examine
and overhaul the function of the col-
lege bookstore is a move many mem-
bers of the college community have
advocated for a long time.

It is a recognition of the view that
the bookstore can serve as a part of
the educational process by making
a large selection of books available.

Tne bookstore is currently operated
as an “Auxiliary Enterprise,” and ac-
cording to the treasurer’s report for
the last fiscal year, it made a profit of
over $8,500.

The sentiment of members of the
committee is toward making the book-
store an entirely nonprofit education-

al facility by using surplus funds to
expand the inventory. In this way a
much larger selection of books would
be made available to the college com-
munity.

The bookstore car be removed from
the list of auxiliary enterprises which
are expected to make a profit, such
as the dormitories, laundry and Union
cafeteria.

There is a definite need for a large
bookstore, since the nearest well-
stocked bookstore is in Chapel Hill.

We commend Dr. Spencer's action
in establishing this committee. Need-
less to say, we are also glad he has
asked the SGA president to appoint
three students to it.

The Professor’s Role

When we examined the roje of the
Davidson professor in our last issue,
we touched only briefly on the most
important aspect of his job—his role
as friend and adviser to students.
This role is built upon two factors—
availability and desire to communi-
cate directly with individual students.

We find in the reference catalogue,
buried amidst a maze of idealistic
assertions about Davidson, a state-
ment which is explanatory of this
role. “In implementing its purpose
to promote higher learning,” the cat-
alogue says, “Davidson has chosen to
be a college, to maintain itself as a
small community of learners, to em-
phasize the teaching responsibility of
all professors, and to ensure the op-
portunity for personal relationships
between students and teachers.”

Without making the unfounded as-
sertion that this close relationship is
characteristic of all Davidson profes-
sors, there does seem to be a genuine
motivation on the part of the major-
ity to foster such relationships. They

hold regular office hours and are gen-
erally available for private consulta-
tion with a student on any matter.
The ill-attended open houses are a-
nother effort they make to isnprove
this relationship.

In an era when committee work and
faculty scholarship are often empha-
sized at the expense of teaching and
advising, Davidson is fortunate to
have maintained such an atmosphere.
Davidson students are lucky not to
have to suffer the pangs of having
graduate school instructors or seeing.
their professors only in class. They
ought to value highly the privilege of
having an informal chat with a pro-
fessor or drinking coffee with him at
the Union.

In an impersonal age, as Davidson
undergoes something of an identity
crisis, this is one tradition which ought
to be preserved at any cost.

The loss of such relationships would
be a stumbling block to Davidson’s
future.

The Tickets Gripe

Athletic ticket policy seems like a
small matter when compared to the
Blue Sky curriculum, the Code of Re-
sponsibility, and the commissions ex-
ploring ways to improve the college
and college life. Yet, like it or not, if
there is one element which binds this
campus together, it is the basketball
team. And one sure way of disrupt-
ing student life is to make it difficult
or impossible for students to see the
games.

We don’t mean to imply that the
Athletic Department is intentionally
disrupting student life, of course, but
it does seem obvious that inconsistent
ticket policy this year has led to well-
founded student gripes.

The failure of the Athletic Depart-
ment to make known its ticket policy
concerning the St. John’s game, for
instance, made it impossible for most
students to get date tickets; a con-
siderable number could not even get
tickets for themselves.

Then at the Citadel game two weeks
later, instead of allowing students to

ehter the game with dates by showing
their LD. cards, it was announced the
afternoon before that students would
have to pick up date tickets at the
gym atter 5:30 on the night of the
game. That also just happened to be
a concert weekend, so this procedure
resulted in a long line at the ticket
office and much inconvenience. Ironic-
ally but not surprisingly, several stu-
dents got tickets but could not find
seats. Too many tickets were sold.

We realize that the difficulties of
providing tickets to a nationally-rank-
ed team’s games are great. At the
same time, however, we believe that
there should be a list of priorities.
And the first of those should be this:
the Wildcats are, first, a team of stu-
dents, for the students.

The Athletic Department should
seek first of all to provide students
and their dates with tickets, then
divvy up the rest among the alumni
and general public. If the some 9,000
remaining seats at the coliseum aren’t
enough, let them watch it on Channel

Beyond Its Usefulness

A few years ago, a distinguished
member of the Board of Trustees de-
livered a Vespers sermon to a crowd
of students who made it plain they
wished they were someplace else.

And so a little later on, when the
board deliberated the fate of com-
pulsory Vespers, this member recall-
ed his lethargic congregation and
argued for an end to that institution.
Vespers, he said, had outlived its
usefulness.

In view of recent chapel pro-
prams, we think the same might be
said for that practice, too. Student
boredom with, and resentment of,
chapel has been spilling over into
coughs, walk-outs and rude clapping.
Pity the poor speakers who have to
contend with it, for even good points
are buried under the rustle of news-
papers. Men who are not accustomed
to abuse leave this campus with a
hitter distaste for the college and its
student body.

We do not condone the behavior of
the student body, but we can under-
stand it. The faculty gave up on chapel
long ago, at least judging from its
attendance Tuesday: five professors,
including the one on the stage.

One might contend that the faculty
knows al! there is to know and there-

fore does not stand to gain anything
from attending chapel.

Or perhaps the faculty finds most
programs as dull as we do and prefers
sipping coffee in the Union to a mid-
morning snooze.

_ President Spencer has promised to
investigate the matter thoroughly,
holding out the prospect of ‘“‘substan-
tial revision,” and his new joint stu-
dent-faculty committee on extra-class-
room responsibilities has chapel at
the top of its list. We only hope the
president and his committee will see
what ought to be done.

Obviously, the solution is abolition
of the awful thing. Trimming down
the number of programs won't re-
duce student apathy or make the pro-
grams any better. This year’s reduced
load of speakers proves that beyond
a doubt.

Why not invite speakers on a reg-
ular basis, advertise the program and
then hold it in Perkins or Hodson or
the Morrison Room? Those interested
in the subject could attend, and the
rest could stay in bed.

Surely any speaker would rather
have 50 listeners than 800 sleepers.
As one student put it, “There’s so
much noise in chapel, you can’t even
sleep there.”

Assembly Behavior

To The Editor:

Davidson's conduct at the
assembly at which Dr. Paul
Miller spoke Jan. 30 left
much to be desired. Though
not the best speaker we've
had all year, he neverthe-
less made what we think
were pertinent points and
certainly deserved more
than having oversized juve-
niles walking out, throwing
wads of paper at each other,
and laughing at him.

Assembly may be an or-
deal, a waste of time, and
a downright bore, but com-
mon decency demands that
anybody taking the time to
come here and speak de-
serves to be treated with
courtesy.

In an academic institution,
all) arguments made in a
formal talk should be list-
ened to with respect, and.
if disagreement exists, it
should be brought out with
logic during coffee hour. not
with tasteless groanings from
the back of the auditorium.

Myth Destroyed

To The Editor:

Sometimes the disparity
between myth and reality
becomes simply ludicruus.

THE MYTH:  Self-styled
Hamiltonian Sam Tallman
as quoted in THE DAVID-
SONIAN: “Such a_ college
(referring to Davidson, we
suppose) provides an atmo-
sphere that is free from the
value (sic) of the masses...

universal approval, how-
ever. The Rev. Graham
Hilly denounced it as ‘‘her-
etical and liberal’ in his
weekly sermon at the.
White House, and Bishop
Homer A. Tomlinson said
it was “another pest which
would be swept away when
my theocratic party brings
Paradise in 1972."

Tomlinson has been the
Theocratic Party's nom-
inee for president for the
past five presidential elec-
tions.

Meanwhile in Davidson,
the college’s Bible and Re-
ligion Department debated
the doctrine’s merits. d

ership of those truly qualifi-
ed to lead."' (What a pile of
CRAP! !)

THE REALITY: The per- |

formance of some Davidson
students in chapel Tuesday.
Granted, required chapel at
present is an offensive in-
stitution. Does this mean we
have to embarrass ourselves
and guests by our boorish
behavior?

The student body seems
unable to make up its mind
on how to attack the chapel
issue. Should it be abolished
because students as a body
are too boorish and myopic
to get anything out of it?
(Believe it or not the speak-
er Tuesday did have some.
thing to say.) Or should it
be abolished because stu-
dents are mature, responsi-
ble individuals quite cap-
able of deciding for them-
selves what is worthwhile
and what is not?

The latter approach would
certainly be most consistent’
with the Code of Responsi-
bility. Such behavior as that
Tuesday makes it difficult
to take students or the idea
of student responsibility ser.
iously.

Do l*s
Mistrusting The Trustees

Some academic mechanic ought to overnaul the
selection of the Board of Trustees—and a few of the

board’s bylaws as well.

Fifty-one men now serve on the board, the govern.
ing -body for Davidson. Twelve of these are elected
by the Alumni Association. The 37 others are elected
by the presbyteries of the Synod of North Carolina,
by two presbyteries in Florida, and by the Asheville
(N. C.) presbytery.

Seventeen of the men elected by the presbyteries
are ministers. Not one trustee elected by the Alumni
Association is a minister.

Fifty-one men. That’s one-20th of the student
body. And for a group that meets together as a group
only twice a year, that’s about 25 men too many.

The faculty’s Self-Study Report has already recom-
mended that the number of trustees be reduced. A
board with 51 members is simply too large to govegn
the college effectively.

Sure, evarybody gets a committee assignment, but
what do some of these committees do? How much can
an unwieldly group of 51 men hope to accomplish?
How can all know enough about an issue to vote intel-
ligently?

One trustee has pointed out that “the smaller the
group, the better the action.” Makes sense, doesn’t it?
Reducing the size of the board would necessitate chang-
ing the selection process. If fewer men served on the.
board obviously somebody must lose some of his rep-
resentation. It's time the presbyteries lost some of
theirs; it’s time to prune away some of the deadwood
on the board.

The risk of allowing presbyteries to elect a prepon-
derance of the trustees is that the presbyteries may be
out of touch with the situation at Davidson College,
and, further, the presbyteries may not always keep
the best interests of the college at the forefront when
electing trustees.

y the presbyteries seem to think that it is vital
to. elect ministers to the board is beyond my compre-
hension. Davidson is not a seminary. And by necessity,
the presbyteries elect Presbyterians.

Yes, Presbyterians may be liberal, and, yes, Pres-

byterian ministers at least have been educated some-
where, but Presbyterian ministers and Presbyterians
may also represent the same viewpoint.
____ Davidson simply does not need any more of this
incestuous inbreeding, this inbreeding which brings
out the worst characteristics of the church and the
college. It tends unreasoningly to maintain the status
quo, tends to enforce religiosity, and it definitely re-
inforces a provincial outlook.

i do not advocate Davidson’s divorcing itself from
the church. But as far as trustee selection and the
trustee bylaws go, some of them a direct product of
the Davidson-church relationship, I do advocate re-

orm.

Binding Davidson to the church with this religion
umbilical cord will be disasterous. The church should
cut this cord and should allow its child, the college,
to assume adult status. A more mature college-church
relationship is necessary now; Davidson has sucked
at the church’s teat long enough.

The trustees should free the college from just
such narrow and limiting bylaws as the ones which
follow. These rules certainly do not aid the cause of
academic freedom, free inquiry, confrontation, nor
even the cause of Christianity and the church. Such
bylaws as these are manifestations of the disease of
pious religiosity and narrow denominationalism:

—‘Whenever a person is recommended for (fac-
ulty) tenure, the Administration, through the Educa-
tion Committee, shall certify to the Trustees that on
the basis of thorough investigation they are convinced
that the nominee:

s committed to the Christian faith and is a mem-
ber of a-Christian church. °

“Comprehends the Statement of Purpose of the
College and intends to promote this purpose.

—"The Trustees shall elect as the President of
the College only a person who is loyal and active
churchman, giving evidence by his life of the strength
of his Christian faith and commitment. No person
Shall be eligible for election as President of the Col-
lege unless he is a member of the Presbyterian Church
and he shall not be eligible for inauguration unless he
is 2 member of the Presbyterian Church of the United

—“A majority of the Faculty and a majority o
the full professors shall be members of some bench
of the Presbyterian Church.”

____I find the narrowness of these governing rules
incredible. Unless these bylaws, and others like them,
are changed, Davidson can never attain any more rel-
evance, nor greatness as an educational institution,
than it already has attained.

__, |! do not advocate the wholesale revocation of re-
ligious stipulations in regard to the presidency of the
college nor to composition of its faculty, But 1 am
convinced that some person-to-person confrontation,
some representation of non-Christian and non-religious
views are valid religious educational procedures.

And how can anyone around here talk about
ecumenism when the trustees blatantly state that no
one but a member of the Presbyterian Church in the
United States is fit to be president of the college?

The provincial pettiness of such bylaws makes
me sick at my stomach.

Does ROTC Build Men ?

To The Editor:

I wonder if I should have
gotten out of RUTC. It seems
that classes are becoming
progressively more exciting.
In one of the recent class
meetings the problem of con-
fronting the enemy was dis-
cussed.

There are two objectives to
the Army's method of fight-
ing. The first is to destroy
the enemy and the other is to
capture him, or in the case
of Vietnam, possibly her.

Because of the trouble in-

volved, killing takes priority
over capturing.

paradoxical. Peace doesn't
thrive when battles are being

It takes an “action guy”
to kill someone without think-
ing why. To quote from an
Army booklet entitled ‘“‘The
Mark of a Man’: “An action
guy can't just wait for things
to happen .. . he makes
them happen. As a combat
soldier you're it. You're the
teeth and claws of the Army.
There's no battle . . . no vic.
tory ... and no lasting peace
without you."

The last statement is rather

fought.

However, I guess that I'm
not man enough to kill any-
one just because someone
tells me to commit such in
sanity. Maybe I am a “‘chick-
en” because I can’t murder
anyone. Maybe I'm spineless
because I can’t obey an order
to kill.

Yes, I really wonder if 1
should have gotten out of
ROTC.
