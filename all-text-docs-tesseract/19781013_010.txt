BB&B lauded far.world peace effort

By BAD BERNARD and
BONEHEAD

Every year for the past year
we have received ten letters
from our readers. We felt that it
would be both appropriate and
interesting to print ten of these
epistles and reply to them in a
public forum.

Dear Scholars:

I have been pleased (burp!)
with your articles this year. You
seem to be following the pattern
of the traditional romanticists
with your diction and grammar,
and yet your syntax stems from
the writings of the Renaissance
(fart!) period. You seldom sole-
cize, and your incorporation of
praxis, jussive’ and syllabica-
tion (hiccup!) is just charming.

Dear Charles: '

We appreciate your compli-
ments, but they seem rather va-
cuous and inane in light of the
fact, that one of us made a 57 on
your English 165 mid-term.

Hunks,

We appreciate the coverage
that you have given Women’s
IMAC this year. Your idea to
do a special about us is super.

suggest. that you write
about each team and make cute
little jokes about some of the
more popular girls. At the end
of the article, you could make
fun of the guys or maybe not
even mention them. Have fun
and come see us sometime.
We love you,

Dear Sambo: a

fied in your thinking. Thanks

for setting us straight and you
can bet your ass a nickel that we
won't write any more crap.

Deer Bernard and Bonchead:
As editor of the Davidsonian
let me congratulate you on the
fine article that you produce
each week. Your column pre-
sents the facts about intramu-
tals at Davidson. You report
objectively on all the games and
even mention the teams that try
so diligently but continue to
lose. Unlike the IMAC writers
of. the past, you do not make

. inside jokes, but present humor

that can be understood by all.
My only request is that you
might, want to mention some of
your friends sometime, and
maybe give the KA’s and

Dear Bernice and Bone:

- — ‘Me and my-buddy Sid have

this running argament between
us whether or not the Library
really is on campus. He says it
‘is and I eay it is down by the
fire hall. Could you settle this
dispute? Aleo he says that there
really are some i for
graduation, Well, I have been

here for four years and have
never heard of such. Again, who
is right? ,
Thanks for your help,
George Bright
Dear George:

We are sorry to say that you
are wrong again. The Library is
on campus. If you are in the 900
room it is the well-lit building
out the front door and across
the lawn. If you are passed out
in Duke it is right in front of
you. As to your second question

_the handbook states that a

minimum of 36 courses and 72
grade points are required for
graduation. If you write us
again, George, please avoid the
cigarette burns on your letter.
BB&B
Dear Brothers Bernie and Bone:
I am a disillusioned young
Negro student and I am really
upset with the way Blacks are
treated on this campus. Me and
another guy, Phil Gilbert, have
started a revolutionary black
militant organization and have
stored some weapons off cam-
pus. Our primary goal is to seize
all the new basketball shoes in

the equipment room and distri-’.

bute them to underprivileged
young people throughout the
world. I am really upset, how-
ever, because Phil (Adul
Kamidd) told me that I cannot
be a genuine true radical revolu-
tionary unless I change my
name to Tanya or Kareem or

something. What do you guys"

think?

Dear Confused:

We have always thought that
Virgil Fludd was.a weird name,
and it could only be to the
benefit of you and your under-
ground organization for you to
change your name. We have
always been partial to Amad
TIalam Jones. Good Luck and
power to the oppressed. BB&B
Dear Nardie and Head:

I am a junior here at David-
son and I am interested in
trying out for the basketball
team. Who is the head coach
this year? How many walk-ons
do they keep? If I get cut and
they change head coaches du-
ring the year can I walk on
again? Just what does walk-on

mean? Has anyone ever walked-

off? Do walk-ons get name
plates over their lockers? Are all
of the assistant coaches really
from New York? Where can I
obtain a copy of the The Book
on John Gerdy?

* Dear Randy:

The following idea was taken
from our book Making People
Think Your Life Is a Success
You need to become involved id
a campus activity. Since the
most prestigious position
(IMAC sports writer) has been
filled, you should run for office
in a worthwhile campus organi-
zation. The French Club has an
opening at Secretary and you
might check to see if the Water
Ski Club needs a new Historian.
Otherwise, run for S.G.A. Pre-
sident. Good luck and be
honest. BB&B
Dear Sirs:

Let me just say that your
Bad Bernard and Bonehead
article is one fine piece of
journalism. I am writing to ask
your permission to model my
column in the exact same
fashion as yours. Presently,
nobody reads my column and I
am in danger of losing my job. I
have to support my wife and

three kids and I just bought my ©
girlfriend a new Cadillac. Do I
have your ission? Do you .
have any i to help me?
Desperate,

Dear Bobby:

As to your column, don’t ©
change it -- that is where we get
all of our ideas. As to your girl-
friend -- beef her. BB&B

In the two big flickerball
games of the week, the Old Men
surprised the SAE’s, 7-6, and
KA Gold held back Hurtin for
Certin, 52-32. The SAB’s were
caught short, with 6 players
missing, but then, excuses are
just like buttholes--everyone
has one. When you get right
down to it, on that afternoon
the Old Men just flat out beat
the E Bags.

_ Kevin Doherty noted after
the game, “This has been my
biggest win since I have been at
Davidson, maybe with the ex-
ception of the South Carolina
game last year.” In the KA
game, the Gold offense looked
strong behind the Rose, but the
defense showed some weak
spots it must fill before the

After the game Andy Smith
made the following comments:
“I just hope those guys that
write that stupid article men-
tion us this week, and give us
the true credit we deserve.”

In games of no importance,
the Penthouse Rowdies edged
the Amazing Girls from Grey
House. Grey House was at a
serious disadvantage as they

of 80-or 81-— only had three players-show up-

for the contest. And we have to
admit that Hot to Trot tries
harder. And now the revised
