A tremendous amount of paper in all forms wafts by us
every day. So much of this paper is wasted, that

There have been numerous
debates as to whether or not
our lives are ruled by time, but
not much thought has ever
been given to the thought that
paper rules our lives. It’s
everywhere - in our rooms, our
halls, our johns, our class-
rooms, our sidewalks - wher-
ever we are, it is.

According to Communica-
tions Director Martha Byrd,
the college buys 87,000 stan-
dard sheets of stationery per
year, as well aS 24,000 execu-
tive size sheets and 6,000
second sheets for both styles.
Paper is ordered through seve-
ral different printers, who buy
it by the carton from paper
wholesalers. A carton contains
as many as 4,000 huge uncut
sheets of paper; 25’’ x 38’ is a
standard size sheet.

On the average, having only
a portion of a carton printed
up costs sixty percent more
than buying the whole carton.
As a small establishment,
Davidson rarely has call to
buy a whole carton’s worth of
paper.

The powers-that-be are
keenly sensitive in their pur-
chasing of paper and printing.
If only half a carton of paper is
needed, saving money may
occur by either purchasing a
whole carton and having it
stored in a printer’s warehouse
or by shopping around and
buying an already-broken car-
ton.

Saving money took a large
step forward this year when

priority over the seventeen
different letterheads that were
used by various departments
last year.

Interestingly enough, buy-
ing recycled paper is neither
economic nor advisable. Recy-
cled paper is generally more
expensive and its color and
consistency varies with each
new batch.

Cost of the paper coming
through the Communications
Office is, to a large extent,
incalculable. Different depart-
ments place different orders
that will eventually be served
by different printers. How-
every, a very rough estimate
can be made on the cost of
departmental stationery.

A typical department will
spend about $50 per year on
stationery. (For example, the
Chemistry Department buys
$35 worth of regular letterhead
and $16 worth of | special
letterhead through the Com-
munications Office each year.)

Taking all departments and
certain organizations into con-
sideration, about $750 per
year is spent for departmental
stationery alone. Add this to
the requirements of massive-
use departments like alumni,
to college catalogs, to com-
mencement programs and all
kinds of special publications.

the problem can actually become frightening.

Seat
ARA Slater is becoming \J&

increasingly more paperized.
This year, they are using a
special plastic-type paper. (I’d
never heard of it either.)
According to Mildred Trull,
Ron Scott’s secretary, Slater
uses roughly 10,000 napkins
per week and about 6,000 cups
per week. Total cost for all
paper supplies is about $225
per week. Add these-up and
you come out in the neighbor-
hood of 330,000 napkins and
200,000 cups annually - about
$7,500 per year on paper
supplies.

The Union has a $1,000
yearly budget for announce-
ment sheets. In addition they
spend $230 for Artist Series
brochures, $371 for poster
paper, and $171 for Union
letterhead stationery (these
are last year’s figures). Each
year, probably $2,000 comes
out of the Union for paper.

Grover Meetze and the Phy-
sical Plant boys buy 252 cases
of toilet paper (100 rolls per
case) and 485 cases of paper

TERS

towels (10 packages per case)
per year. The cost of these
supplies is about $10,500.

A final important consider-
ation is the Xerox and mimeo-
graph paper. On the average,
there are about 43,000 Xer-
oxed copies made per month
and about 120,000 mimeo-
graphed copies.

Copying paper costs $2.96
per thousand sheets (we’ve got
a special deal). That’s approx-
imately $500 per month or
$5,000 per year spent on
copying: paper (exclusive of
Xerox and mimeograph prin-
ting costs).

All told, probably $35,000 is
spent each year for paper and
paper supplies. Add in the
laundry, student supplies, and

various incalculable others,

the total is probably close to
$75,000. That’s a lot of paper!
Surprisingly enough, there

When everthing is considered the College
probably spends as much as $75,000
a year for paper.

is much consideration of costs
and conservation on the admi-
nistration/buying level. Cita-
tions of savings within the
Communications Office have
already been made.

The burden of responsibility
for conservation lies not on the
buyers, but on the faculty and
student body. Excesses are
evident. A stack of last fall’s
popular film schedule is easily
spotted in the Union. A per-
functory glance in the snack
bar reveals strewn napkins.
From time to time, the trees
are ‘‘decorated” with toilet
paper. By granting the vera-
city. of conservationist/envi-
ronmentalist concerns for cost
and supply of paper, perhaps
conscious restraints are in
order.
