Johnston emphasized several
times that he was speaking ‘‘as
an individual and not for the
faculty” in presenting two ways
that. he thought Davidson could
improve itself in the area of
curriculum.

Johnston said that he would
like to see the college redefine
its divisions of study. Currently,
the curriculum is divided into
natural science (which includes
math), languages, and social
science (which includes every

dren directly.

Correspondence by the Gift
Fund Committee with the North
Carolina Council of Churches
suggested a second project. Be-
gun in 1951, this program con-
ducted by the Council is a Min-
istry to the Migrant Workers.
Centered in North Carolina, it is
designed to bring the Gospel to
the camps of the migrant wwork-
ers.

The YMCA initiates the 1964
Gift. Fund Tuesday in chapel
when the purposes of the fund
and its suggested projects for
this year will be formally pre-
sented to the student body.

Jeff Wampler, chairman of the
Gift Fund, spoke of this year's
goal as “modest but realistic.”
Set at $2300, the goal is some-
what less than the $3300 raised in
1962 and the $2800 sum: of 1961.
Wampler spoke optimistically of
obtaining this sum because of
the ‘variety and nature of the
projects.

“Save the Children Founda-
tion” is the first suggested for
consideration. International in
scope, this. project is aimed at
providing education for all chil-
dren. Operating on a self-help
basis much like CARE, the

Nevin's Vocational School
trains mentally-retarded persons
in manual skills thus enabling
them to become self-sufficient.
The school is in need of a com-
plete new workshop and. equip-
ment.

Dean of the Faculty Froitis W. Johnston surprised the students assembled to
hear him speak on “What, If Anything, is Wrong With the Curriculum at Davidson?
Wednesday night at Open End by taking a liberal viewpoint and suggesting that sev-

| eral changes indeed could be made in courses to improve the education of the school’s

course not included in the first
two categories). The dean point-
ed out that ‘In this third area
you get a range all the way from
Bible to physical education."’

Johnston held, “This is an un-
natural division. Most liberal
arts colleges have their divisions
include natural science, social
science, and the humanities.
Here, you don't have to take
any social science (such courses
as sociology. political science,
etc.). Therefore, I feel «we should
rearrange our divisions so we
could require studies in areas
of social science. I believe that
most of the problems of your
generation have to do with ques-
tions raised in the studies of the
social sciences."

Johnston next took the side of
many students in the desire for
more chances for independent
study here. “I feel we ought to
do a great deal more than we
now do in the field of independ-
ent study. I think that every
student ought to do some sort of
independent study in his major
field."

The dean said that he felt
every student, not just those
with high grades, could gain
some benefit from Independent
work guided by the faculty.

Johnston said that the nearest
thing Davidson now has to in-
dependent study is its Honors
Program. This program is gen-
erally limited to students of his-
tory or English. Johnston be-
lieves that so little emphasis is
put on the Honors Program now
for two reasons:

Bill Rule Receives Letter:

Africa A Still- Dark Land

(Editor's note: Below is a portion of a letter received by Bill Rule, a Davidson junior, from his

missionary mother after an uprising in the Congo iast month. Rule

has provided an introduction for

Converging from thousands of scattered toy ‘villages, upon the crowded streets of new cities.
Africans are encountering social changes which elude simple generalization. For the first. time
they encounter POSSIBILITIES, but lacking these themselves, they must demand. Can it be sur-
prising that. when these people see their own importance anew through the eyes of strangers, yet
do rot know how to obtain what others have. they turn in frustration and confusion to violence for

the goods and dignity they had expected independence to bring?

Plagued with power struggles. economic instability and hostile diversity of language and tribes,
the government is, to our concern, threatened when the mysteries of international politics and
promises step into this vacuum: of needs. Our journalistic analyses deal so often with the spectacle
of mass violence that we miss the intensely personal aspects behind every headline.

Below, you may read, in the narrative of a misled revolt. something of the individuals: in-
volved—the young and the old, the rash and the conservative. the violent and the peaceful. If you
can learn something of the deep concern as well as the deep hate from this letter. it‘is perhaps:

The central government did
nothing at the time so we hope
and pray they are doing some-
thing NOW. All the little and
big Congolese government people
in the area had to rua for their
lives for the Communist groups

ernment more than anything
else. The Catholics got much
worse treatment and some of
their stories are really terrible.

“Participation in the program
has been extra for faculty mem-
bers. They have done the work
without additional compensation
by the college while carrying
regular loads. The other reason
is that a great many depart-
ments don't feel that the pro-
gram is the way to get at what
they want to do."

In summary, Johnston — said
that he would criticize the pres-
ent curriculum at Davidson from
two standpoints. ‘‘On the one
hand, it lacks breadth in social
sciences and on the other it
lacks depth in the major.”

Johnston also said during the
question period foliowing the
presentation of his ideas, ‘I
think that minor requirements
ought to be abolished. What
§ am proposing now Is that this
be done and that the extra
hours be used fo expand the
major to thirty hours or that
more hours be used for elec-
tives.”

Johnston stressed that by
“proposing’’ the idea of elimin-
ating the minor requirements he
only meant ‘‘I am talking it up
and trying to get other people's
opinions. I do not know _ yet
whether or not it will come up
for a vote before the faculty.”

Johnston also launched into
surprising criticisms of such
things as Vespers and the lack

“The Visit’ by Friedrich
Duerenmatt, winner of the New
York Drama Critics’ Award for
the Best Foreign Play of the
1958 Broadway. season, will be
the second major drama produc-
tion by the newly established
Department of Drama _ and
Speech. Production dates are
Feb. 20-22 at 8:15 in Hodson

Hall.

Duerenmatt, a Swiss who
writes in German, describes the
play as a comedy which ends
tragically. The plot concerns
the return of a wealthy woman
to the town from which she was
driven as a young girl. She of-
fers a gift of a billion marks to
the improverished town in return
for the life of the villager who
caused her expulsion.

What follows is what Brooks
Atkinson in his review of ‘‘The
Visit’ in the New York Times
called “‘the kind of ruthless bit-

of books in the library in re-
sponse to questions from stud-
ents.

The dean said that he did not
think the lack of books in the
library would ‘“‘be a sufficient
enough reason to keep us from
establishing a program of in-
dependent study.'’ But he added,
giving administrative recognl-
tion of the fact the library is
undersupplied with books, “I
agree that the library néeds
some more books."’

As to the question of com-
pulsory religion at Davidson,
Johnston sald, “I criticized
Vespers in my day, and |
criticize it now to a certain
extent.” The dean never did
say what he meant by his last
four words.

In.. answering a question by
Student Body President John
Spratt, Johnston said, “I think it
would be all right to have stud-
ents for advisors of the Curri-
culum Committee (of which
Johnston is chairman)."’ He
said, however, ‘I don't. think
they should be voting members
of the committee."

Thus, Johnston apparently
opened the door for Spratt to
move toward placing several
students on the important com-
mittee in an advisory capacity.

The college is connecting its
electrical system to a higher
voltage. This campus change
over, only one part of a transi-
tion that will affect the entire
town of Davidson, has required
ditches to be dug near Chambers
Building and the library for the
installation of the necessary
cables and wires.

Grover Meetze., director of the
physical plant and a member of
the Davidson Town Council, ex-
plained that Duke Power Co. has
offered this higher voltage for
more efficient use of existing
lines and for more power. The
economic advantages of the im-
proved system justify the con-
version expense, he said.

While making these changes,
the college has also upgraded
its whole electrical system. Con-
duits have been installed for
possible voltage increases in the
future. A new sub-station will
soon allow the college to operate
even when power fails for the
rest of the town.

Trees along the edge of the
campus have been trimmed to
accommodate new lines: sore
trees have been removed. Else-
where in the town new poles,
lines, and transformers have
been installed.

The new system is scheduled
to go into operation on March

29 after an outlay by the college
of approximately $9,000.
