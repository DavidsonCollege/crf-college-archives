THE DAVIDSONIAN OPINIONS MONDAY, OCTOBER 11, 1993

In Black & White: Tene' Moore &
Chris Edmonston

Beauty is in the eye
of the beholder.

Images of beauty: rainbows;
sunsets over ocean vistas; snowy
mountain peaks; freshly cut roses;
bright stars on clear nights.

If we all agree that these are
universal images of beauty, then
why do we differentiate along cul-
tural and racial lines when evaluat-
ing physical beauty? We under-
stand that everyone has personal
“Beauty standards.” However, ste-
reotypes often times steer our per-
ceptions away from honest feel-
ings of attraction. Stereotypes push
everyone towards abeauty “norm.”

This “norm” is the false belief
that only women who are thin,
have long straight hair, slender
faces, or light colored eyes are
beautiful. We (particularly Ameri-
cans) are constantly bombarded
with these public images.

Even though definitions are
constantly changing, the “norm”
has remained constant. We are
confronted on our televisions, in
our magazines, and in our malls.
Marilyn Monroe remains the ar-
chetype.

A recent article in Essence
magazine states, “Oh yes, some-
times the look changes as those
who are styled arbiters decree bru-

nettes, exotics or ethnics the latest
‘in’ look. But no matter that they
may sing the praises of voluptuous
this year or dark sultry the next, the
objects of beauty are always over-
whelmingly white. And as the
ambitious so-so singer Madonna
knew when she reached for the
bleach and peroxide, blonde is still
considered the apogee.”

Here at Davidson, we fall vic-
tim as well. While no exact figures
are known, eating disorders ap-
pear to be prevalent at our college.
How many times have we gone to
the weight room, aerobics, or run-
ning due to guilty feelings about
appearances or because “everyone
else is doing it?” Likewise, have
you ever found yourself thinking
“She sure is pretty for a black girl”
or, “He has a cute butt for a white
guy?”

Will there ever be a universal
image of beauty? As you make
your own beauty judgements keep
this in mind,

Beauty am I, Spirit am I.

I am the infinite within my
soul.

Ican find no beginning, Ican
find no end, #

All this I am! ;

school. Others can’t believe such
a bright guy as myself would go to
aredneck, no-name school in North
Carolina. “Ignorance is bliss,” the
old line says. I’d like to add that
ignorance is bliss, but it is still
ignorance, and uninformed folks
are missing out.

Fine, we all know that.
Davidson is the best school in the

country, bar none, and my oh-so--

Ivy high school classmates who go
to the Tea Room instead of The
Pub, who take arrogance 101 in-
stead of Humes, who are in classes
with more people than there are
living in the town of Davidson, and
who use pickup lines like, “PBS
turns me on,” are missing out.
This chubby Davidson man
takes that as an insult. I’ll gladly
exchange nobody knowing where
Igotoschool for the education I’m
getting and the friends I have here.
Besides, do I need another self-
congratulatory ego boost anyway?
People tell me Davidson is
going national. Why? I was dili-

of the South?

gent enough in my college search
to locate a hidden gem. Hooray for
me, and for others like me. I don’t
want people from my high school
to come down here and think they
own the place, they’re so sophisti-
cated, so “cutting-edge,” with such
a can’t-miss future.

Students work hard here, even
me. Students play hard here. Just
ask Yale soccer.

Does anything advertised on
TV work? Selsun Blue? Bufferin?
Hair Club for Men (I’m not only a
columnist, but soon to be a cus-
tomer)? Well, I’m not one to say,
but I know that Davidson is what it
says it is. I’m just wondering if,
because some people’s urge to at-
tract Ivy leaguers here, Davidson
will start misrepresenting itself, or
worse yet, change intoa self-styled
Princeton of the South.

We will always attract the
Davidson type—honorable, well-
rounded, andintelligent—if we tell
the truth. Davidson is not for ev-
eryone, Pardon me if by this I bug
any reform-minded non-tradition-
alists, but thank God.

I have this book, A Guide for
the Advanced Soul, that I often
read when troubled. The editor,
Susan Hayward, put together a
bunch of insightful quotations,
designed to help with any dilemma.

I’ve been dwelling too much
on the past. I’ve wasted a lot of
time harboring anger at someone
that did me a wrong turn not too

Ken ago. So I again turned to the

The message I got was this:
“Dwell not on the past. Use it to
illustrate a point, then leave it be-
hind. Nothing really matters ex-
cept what you do now in this in-
stant of time.”

Dwelling on the past has al-
ways been a big problem for me.
My inability to separate experi-
ence from emotion has kept me
from many realizations, and has
insured my learning a few lessons
the hard way.

But what the quotation says is
true. The only instant of time that

really matters to us is right now.
Regretting the past or dreading the
future accomplishes only one thing:
making a mess of the present.

This morning I walked around
campus preoccupied, totally lost
in my anger towards this person.
“What she did was wrong. I have
4 sight.to.be angry, with her,” I
thought tomyself. But what is that
anger accomplishing?

The experience I hadis over. I
went through it. I’m not going
through it anymore, Yet emotion-
ally I feel like Iam. Sound famil-
iar?

The emotions we associate
with the past can prevent us from
experiencing the present as we
should. Indeed, the emotions of-

ten get in the way of the lesson we
should have learned, the lesson we
should be applying to life right
now. What did my anger do for me
today? It kept me from studying,
from enjoying the conversations I
had and from appreciating the beau-
tiful morning surrounding me.
Learn from experience. Don’t re-
gret it, or feel pain for it now.

It’s difficult to say what the
past is, whether it’s good or bad.
The only thing we know for sure
about the past is that it’s gone. So
start fresh every morning, leaving
yesterday’semotions behind so you
can feel today’s fully, as you
should.

Don’t waste the present. It’s
all you’ve got.

Semester in Exile: Chris Frampton

Why so much
country music?

Idiocy.

The scourge of our society.
The plague that runs rampant
among those of higher stature. The
disease that has set our once illus-
trious college on a crash course
with ruin. Andin no place isidiocy
more prevalent than the pages of
the Davidsonian.

Tam not talking about the opin-
ions of most our columnists. I am
not talking about the editorials pro-
vided by our distinguished edito-
rial staff. Iam not talking about the
news stories or Cat Nips or the
cartoons. .

Iam talking about one simple,
hideously disgusting aspect of the
paper that cannot be avoided.

Folks, there are two country
music columns.

Without a doubt, country mu-
sic is the most idiotic, pointless
form of music in the history of the
world, civilized or uncivilized.
Disco has more rhythm. Classical
has more class. Rock and roll has
more soul. andl Fee ea Mieke teens:

UL BEI

ing. Country music is just stupid,
stupid music.

Actually, that is not true.
Country music’s culture does in-
volve intelligence.

Take for example the dance
steps. To dance to country you
have to practice, practice, practice.
You have to memorize those com-
plicated steps. You have to learn
to lead or learn to follow. Butmost
importantly, you have to learn to
count to four.

To play country guitar is even
more complicated. Not only do
you have to be able to count to
four, but you also have to learn to
play three chords: G, C, D. If you
want to be one of the all time
greatest, you might learn an F or
even, now this is a little crazy, an
A.

But perhaps the most wonder-
ful example of the intelligence in-
volved with the country culture
comes in the form of sport. “

Actually, calling car racing a
belt is ha ms ‘acta, but rll give

it the benefit of the doubt for the
sake of argument. Consider
NASCAR on TV: “Here goes
Rusty, he’s going to make a left
turn. Now he’s going to make
another left turn. Uh, oh, it’s left
again.” Wow, what excitement.

But for an even greater sign of
idiocy, I mean intelligence, con-
sider NASCAR on the radio,
though thinking about it may be a
sign of a sub-40 IQ, so you might
not be able to.

Now, I am not talking about
the intelligence of our country col-
umnists. Well, maybe I am. But I
am sure there must be a smart
country fan out there. Although I
would also bet that person was a
little psychologically disturbed.
(i.e. Crazy as a drunken wombat.)

Buthere is the topper problem
with country: I think Bill Gullan
likes it.

I will give the country music
fans on campus a bit of credit.
They did manage to take and pass
their core requirements, and they
still go to school here, which is
something your illustrious colum-
nist (me) does not do. However, I
wanted to congratulate myself for
writing a whole column about one
topic. Of course, I want to end it by
reminding you to take (and pass)
