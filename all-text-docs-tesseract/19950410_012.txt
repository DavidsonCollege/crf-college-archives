Sweet Success

Matthew Sweet's new album
is a show of quality and talent

By Tom Bavis
Music critic for The Davidsonian

Matthew Sweet has created perfect
pop music, and he calls it 100% Fun.
From the fat guitar riff of the opening
song, “Sick of Myself” to the bittersweet
piano that closes “Smog Moon,” Sweet’s
new album comes close to living up to its
incredibly lofty title.

In case you are not familiar with
Matthew Sweet, here is a quick descrip-
tion. Playing guitars and taking all the
vocals, Sweet and his ever-shifting back-
ing band update the guitar pop sound
created in the 1960s by the Byrds and the
Beatles. When he does it right, though,
his albums have a sound all theirown. He
reinvents rather than merely copies hi
idols’ music. ,

“Sick of Myself,” the rousing first
single, shows his ability to write catchy,
original tunes. With the help of Brendan
O’ Brien (who has done an excellent job
producing Pearl Jam and Stone Temple
Pilots, among others), the song forces a
thick, warm sound out of the speakers that
will make you think you’re spinning a
record instead of a CD.

Starting with a chromatic vocal run,
“Not When I Need It” features the most
interesting melody Sweet has ever con-
ceived. Again, the world of sound he

creates includes big drums, lots of gui-
tars, and flawless harmonies. Hopefully
he will stick with O’ Brien as a producer;
had his 1991 classic album Girlfriend
been recorded this well, it could have

sold millions.

Though the songs on 100% Fun may
not match the superlative quality of those
on Girlfriend, it is still the best album I
have heard in over a year.

often sound composed, while composi-
tions have the most vibrancy when they
have an improvised feel. This interaction
is the most important way that we go

_ about expanding the formal context of the

work.”

Perhaps the most engaging aspect of
the concért was the use of extended tech-
niques to combine percussive and rhyth-
mic sounds while maintaining a melodic
contour. The trio incorporated twentieth
century techniques such as flutter-tongu-
ing, over-blowing, and hole thumping to
produce distinct percussive sounds. Their

:

Hackford creates the past as a world both
vivid and beautiful, as well as traumatic
and terrifying for Dolores and her daugh-
ter.
This movie is not the usual King
horror flick about monsters in the sewer
and zombies on the prow. It is a movie
about both the ability of womanhood to
surmount loneliness and self-isolation in
asmall town, male dominated society and
the power of forgiveness — not exactly
what you would expect from Stephen
King.

classical training enables the group to
utilize the method of circular breathing,
which allows a continual melodic line
without any tonal distortion or sharp
pauses.

The group also says of their music,
“In the context of improvisation, we are
building on the African-American forms
which are predominant in twentieth cen-
tury American music. We also draw on
experience performing the western clas-
sical music which is traditionally the
Starting point for through-composed
music in this country.” Through-com-
posed music (non-strophic) is similar to
jazz in which'there is no repetition or

refraining.

For the unexperienced listener, the
concert bordered, at times, on cacopho-
nous hiccupping coupled with high-
pitched frequencies.

Dick, Parran, and Rothenberg were
casual and laid-back, yet their keen atten-
tion to perfection was obvious. At one
point in the concert, Parran sat down
during the middle of a song and began to
either meditate or catch a quick nap.

Seldom does an audience witness a
performing musician whocan soelegantly
incorporate a sneeze into a piece, but for
Parran it simply fit the improvisational
mood of the piece.
