ross-country kills common sense

Rain or shine, they trek around
campus every day: each step becom-
ing more difficult, the pain growing
more intense.

And yet, contrary to what they
would have us believe, Davidson’s
cross country runners are not en-
gulfed by suicidal tendencies or
masochistic thoughts of running until

they drop from fatigue. While they -

are bound toward a common goal,
each achieves his aim in a unique
fashion, as varied as their custom-
made shoes.

to block the whole thing from his
mind.

George Strobel becomes so keyed
up at times he has been unable to eat.
Constrast this with Zack Murrell,
who ingests assorted candy bars.

Even with everyone concentrating
on running hard during the race (“‘No
pain, no gain,’’ said one disillusioned
upperclassman.), the thoughts fleet-
ing through long-distance runners’
heads vary.

Ed Anderson thinks about catching

which the runners prepare for a meet.

Doug Horn, captain of the cross
country team, often begins thinking
about a big meet the week before, and
has even been known in the past to
mumble the names of opponents in his
sleep. At the other end of the
spectrum, freshman Jeff. Morrow tries

Sterling Martin’s wrath) contem-
plates faking an injury to avoid
finishing the race.

Once the race is completed and the
pressure and tension ends, not every-
one is relieved. For Doug Horn, his

time and finish determine his reac-
tion.

George Strobel is never satisfied,
yet Zack Murrell and Jeff Morrow
have a feeling’ of accomplishment
after having pushed themselves for
six miles.

So, the next time one of these
long-distance runners crosses your
path, just think to yourself, ‘‘One of
those guys wants to be a horse,” or
‘‘Is he the one who always hears
footsteps?’’ Because yes, some of

those guys do.

They racked up three tries and
two field goals, while holding
Belmont Abbey to a single
try.

In the second half, both
teams were repeatedly bogged
down in the quagmire as field
conditions degenerated. Also,
the ball became increasingly
difficult to handle and contin-
ually squirted from the grasp
of ball-carriers.
