The Other Side...

Since we expressed our opinion
several weeks ago on the subject,
much has been said and done toward
solving the problem about the future
of social fraternities on the campus.
The following article was sent’to the
Davidsonian by the National Inter-
fraternity Conference and sheds
some light on the opinion of that
group as to the future for the Greeks.
We are not reversing our opinion, but
such a difficult situation demands
thorough Consideration of both sides
of the issue before a decision is
reached.

WASHINGTON, D. C.—The col-
lege fraternity, whose pattern has
been.woven into the fabric of Amer-

ican education for 118 years, is gird-:

‘ng its loins to meet theterrifie dis-
location of a nation at total war.

The ranks of the undergraduate
Greek-letter society men are rapidly
becoming decimated as the collegians
join the colors, leaving some 2,500
fraternity houses, valued at $80,000,-
000, vacant on 125 campuses.

A special war committee of the Na-
tional Interfraternity Conference,
headed by Cecil J. Wilkinson of
Washington, is developing ways and
means to insure the continuity of the
functioning: of the fraternities so
long as any men are available for
undergraduate membership.

The navy has announced and the
army has indicated that they will
have no objection to enlisted men
who are sent to college for special-
ized_training joining fraternities. In
these soldier and sailor students the
college Greeks expect to find suffi-
cient membership recruits to carry
on at least a chapter cadre.

During the First World War an
order was issued by a subordinate in
the War Department declaring that
fraternity life and military discipline
were not compatible in those colleges
where the student army training

—eorps-operated—The National Inter-

fraternity Conference appealed to
Secretary of War Newton D. Baker,
a former president of his own col-
lege fraternity, who countermanded
the original edict, enabling fratern-
ity life to continue.

In the current conflict the college
Greeks hope to initiate men who have
not yet reached the draft age, as well
as those who are barred from mili-
tary service by physical disability.

They expect also to draw members
from the ranks of the pre-medicals,
the pre-engineers and pre-dentals.

The fraternity leaders believe that
the problem of the vast real-estate
holdings will be solved in many in-
stances by the leasing of the houses
by the armed forces through the col-
leges and universities.

Already some of the Greek lodges
have been taken over by the army
and navy. It is expected that be-
tween $9 and $12 per month will be
paid as room rent for each man billet-
ed in a fraternity house. Such com-
pensation would enable the house-
owning corporations to meet their
carrying charges and preserve their
holdings until normal college life is
resumed after the end of the war.

In the state of Arizona the legis-
lature has passed an emergency bill
authorizing the governor and the
secretary of state to lend from funds
received from the sale or lease of uni-
versity timber lands to fraternities
owning real estate at the University
of Arizona a sufficient sum to retire
the mortgages on such real estate.
The loans, secured by first mort-
gages, bear 3 per cent interest, and
are to be repaid before 1970.

Of the approximately 900,000 liv-
ing college fraternity men, it is’ esti-
mated by Chairman Wilkinson of the
war committee that more than 135,-
000 are-in-the armed forces. More
than 500 Greek-letter men have been
killed in action and many have won
citations for gallantry.

The national fraternities have
been heavy producers of war bonds.
Several have donated ambulances.
Many undergraduate chapters have
volunteered as groups as blood don-
ors.

Keep Campus Clean...

' The Davidson Campus is a beauti-
ful-spot-in-the-springtime. But-re-
cently, largely’ through student
thoughtlessness ‘in discarding paper
and trash, the front campus has been
in a condition-far from praiseworthy.

A cleanup detachment of the air-
crew students has done a thorough
job of freeing large sections of the
campus from the scattered debris.
They removed truck loads of leaves,
completely rid the back half of the
‘ampus of littered paper; some were
even seen picking up cigarette butts
one by one from-around the entrances
to. Chambers building. Students
should be grateful for this service
rendered them.

When the shameful conditions on
the front campus have been improv-
ed, we should refrain from making
it unsightly again. Cans for the dis-
posal of waste paper and other trash
are placed at frequent intervals on
the campus for this purpose. Let’s
think twice before tossing a paper
aside next time, thereby marring the

natural beauty of the college:

?

grounds.

Mother’s Day

Plans are already taking definite
shape for the second Mother’s Day
celebration on the campus, which
comes this year on the week-end of
May 8. An outline of the scheduled
events, as released by the publicity
office, appears elsewhere in this is-
sue of the Davidsonian.

Those who participated in the oc-
casion last year were delighted with
its success. It should be equally at-
tractive this year and provides an ex-
cellent opportunity for mothers and
sons to spend a week-end_together,
especially in view of-the fact that
many students will soon be going in-
to the service. It is another example
of the effort being made to provide

pleasant week-ends on the campus~

this year.

Invite your mother right
away. ‘

“Bonecrusher” Wilt

Since we have two groups living
apart in diffefent dormitories and
maintaining somewhat different
schedules we find it difficult to
intimately include the new group
in our writing. We're pleased
therefore, to have found a swell
voice for them. in. Marlyn Wilt who
will carry the:ball one week, then
flip it our way the next.

It’s all yours Marlyn.

AL LANG.

introduction, you really have no
idea how much this means to me.
Don't expect too much, then you
won't be disappointed.

I would like to come back at
“Al” and the men of ‘Squadrons A
and B (you, noticed that I said Al
and the Men) with a great big loud
boisterous roar of thanks for the
very kind welcome extended from
the men of Squadrons C and D.

Our first impressions of the up-
perclassmen was terrible, (please
underline that three times for Jack
and Joe, who were wearing brass
knuckles until yesterday), but now
we must, or at least we will say
sincerely to each and every man
that we believe it has been a great
pleasure, indeed, to be allowed the
privilege of joining hands with
such a fine group of fellows in the
start of our ascension of a ladder
which will reach the supre me
heights, which are success and ulti-
mate VICTORY,

In a previous edition of the
Davidsonian the “rat line” was de-
fined, The impressions of the fel-
lows of their first few days here,
we believe, can be indicated: by a
short excerpt from, “Incentive” by
George Matthew Adams. The ex-
cerpt is as follows: “The child is
born with an early sense, or desire,
to find out things. Most of its
slumbering faculties move slowly,
but curiosity is one of the first to
leap into activity.”

Yes, you upperclassmen could
have called (past tense) us embryo-
cadets that first week, if you had
wanted, but now, no.

We wanted to find out things, we
were curious to know what the “rat
line” was, Did we find out? Well
they tell me that Messrs. Wick-
ham, Brown, Wiggeton, Whetsel,
Wolfe, and a few other - brother
Aviation students oft this collaeate

organization of ours had said the.

older classmates had used asperity
to-a certain extent in the obtain-
ing of a very well executed line.”
But now that it’s nearing its con-
clusion, the fellows look back ‘and
say, “that was fun, wasn’t it?”
(No murmuring from C and D,
please.)

There is one imaginary flight in
Squadron D which has/ already as-
signéd their -chief—“(what ‘shall 1
say now) grease monkey. They
call him “Mech” (pronounced Mac)
and he has stated that it’is very
sickening to hear the name. (Don’t
tell him this but the fellows-hon-
estly think that he will make the
best, one of the best, pursuit pilots

“how to

in the U. S. Army Air Forces for
slapping those dirty, so and so
Japs).

From observation many persons
have come to the conclusion that
the 24th College Training Detach-
ment has the “salutenest” bunch
of men in the nearby territory,
Maybe right now we have a pretty
good outfit, but be careful gentle-
men, don’t get the big head as
Lt. Warley puts it. Those other
groups have got it in them to make

} _ us look rather sickly if we don’t
Thank you Mr. Lang for the fine ”

maintain the Mere Foundation we
have. Keep building.

Speaking of saluting, Lt. Warley
says that his own ‘arms even get
tired returning’ salutes to the nice
young children of Davidson. He
likes this, kids, let’s get his arm
really sore.

Wisps of swirling clouds said by,
the moonbeams of romantic moon-
lite shine through in a very time-
ly manner. Just when Henry was
going to — now now — This and
heaven too, has been setting many
hearts throbbing with the rapture
of an emotional romance. Oh yes,
there are girls of course, pretty
girls. Speaking of the sparks of
sweet words from the hen here and
the stultifying effects it has,
Messrs. Woods Wyen, Wilmer and
Spearman seem to have attained
the knack of meeting the lovely
ladies at the Armory in Charlotte
on their first night out better than
some of the upperclassmen have in
six weeks,

Maybe some fellows just know
“fan the breeze” better
than others. Do you suppose they
do Mr. Wileoxen?

What is it that every week-end
sends Eddie “Cookie” Kuklinski
back from Charlotte with a trance-
like expression on his face? Could
it be charming bathing beauty
picture on his dresser?

In closing we’re going to toss
orchids, with the sweetest of frag-
rance, to the new cadet officers,
who are and have so excellently
taken over practically the full re-
sponsibility of leadership in the
absence of the very busy officials
of thé post. We are thrilled to
have our group realize that thing
we. so, sometimes, insignificantly
call training can easily be estab-
lished in» such’ a democratic way.
More power gentlemen and also
let’s see lots of stiff competition
from our lowerclassmen. Utilize
what you’ve got, add quite a little
moré andtet’s go men, ;

Professional men can employ tht
use of chewing gum, lollipops, ba-
loons and whistles but the Army
affords no profession, so if there
is any Way on earth to get to the
top it must be from the use of that
little thing we call a brain.

Read this with_a-pointed finger
and a sort of disconnected chortle,
a sweeping shissht, that kek-kek
sound and then a downward sweep
of the fist and ssptt and you’ve got
nothing.

Good’ Evening
