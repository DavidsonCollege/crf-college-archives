THE DAVIDSONIAN

OPINIONS.

MONDAY, OCTOBER 28, 1996

You know, a lot of people are
boring; it’s a simple fact of life that
we all have to deal with.

Now, maybe a particular per-
son is boring because talking to
him/her is about as engrossing as
having a conversation with one of
the computers in the basement of
Belk, or maybe s/he doesn’t do
anything exciting, engaging, or
entertaining.

If you’re one of the select not-
so-few bores among us, and you
don’t like the fact that people keep.
falling asleep while you talk and
talk and talk about episode number
62.of Star Trek or how good the
shepherd’s pie in Chez Vailis, you
can change your reputation within
days without actually having to be
an interesting person.

Don’t Be Such a Bore

One way to do this is to write
anI’m-mad-as-hell-and-I-haven’t-

really-thought-through-this-too- -

much-but-I-ain’t-gonna-take-it-
any-more editorial in The
Davidsonian. Discuss a topic like
how Davidson is being over-run
with political correctness or how
gender relations here (and world-
wide, of course) are very close to
ideal. Use questionable logic and
misspell words like rationale re-
peatedly.

A few people will say how
glad they are that someone finally
said what they’d been thinking;
most others will call you a
blithering idiot. For a while, you
will be the hot topic in conversa-
tions everywhere. In order to keep
up the facade of being interesting,

you will unfortunately have to con-
tinue writing these inflammatory
articles, and you will eventually
become a bigger bore than you
were before. No one’s as boring as
someone who only has a single
opinion and says it over and over in
different ways.

This brings us to the second
solution, which is easier and will
guarantee your status as acool dude/
chick. It is a very simple but effec-
tive principle:

Loudly deny rumors about
yourself in the library.

There is no better way to se-
cure arumor than to deny it, so find
someone who is willing to help
you, and while you’ re studying to-
gether, talk to that person about
how you’re not nearly as wild and

crazy as everybody says. Here
are some examples:

“T did not drink an entire
bottle of tequila last Friday!”

“T swear I didn’t wake up in
his/her room.” :

"No, no. You heard it all
wrong. The cops didn’t come by
my place.”

These are, of course, only
examples, and seeing as how you
had the brains to get into school
here, you can obviously think up
some of your own. Youcanmake
people think you have any at-
tribute you want merely by deny-
ing that you have it and making
sure that someone hears you.

Now, at this point you may
be saying how full of it I am, but
think about it. We all know that

the library is the social center of the
college, and I’m sure that we’ve all
overheard some juicy bits of gossip
floating from that table next to us.
Hell, I’ve heard people talking
smack about me without realizing
that I was studying a few feet away.

Within two weeks of your de-
nial, the rumor (orrumors, if you’re
ambitious) will be cemented in the
college’s collective consciousness,
and you'll be the talk of the town.

People will invite you to par-
ties, acquaintances will treat you
like the grand poobah of coolness,
and all the guys wearing baseball
caps who walk by you, bob their
heads, and say, “Sup,” will continue
to walk by you, bob their heads, and
say, “Sup.”. Some things never
change.

Fraternities at Davidson have
gone through a lot of phases,
mostly as the tide of public opin-
ion turns one way or the other.
After the everybody-feel-good
vibes of the 60s crept into
Davidson in the seventies, frater-
nities were under the gun.

In the Darwinist 80s, they
were as strong as ever. Now, in
the PC 90s, elitist clubs for men
are definately out of vogue and
are threatened again here at
Davidson. Without fraternities,
Davidson becomes simply an-
other Amherst wanna-be, dream-
ing culturally diverse dreams,
chasing good thoughts, and filled
with idealistic computer pro-
gramers.

Can you imagine a weekend
where the only social activities
were sponsored by the school?
Frankly, that’s not a place I want
to be associated with. Therefore,
to keep Davidson the proud
school it has always been, it is
your right, no, your duty to join

Backlash

Heyward Carter
So, you want to be a frat boy

every weekend, and spend the next
four years of your life throwing up
on America’s best and brightest.
Do it for your country, do it for
yourself, but most of all, do it for
Davidson.

Now that you’ ve read this dia-
tribe, here are a few helpful hints
when you are trying to decide what
fraternity is right for you.

—If you can find new and exciting
uses for black plastic, and don’t
mind a possible commute, then
SAE is a good bet.

— If your desire to be a doctor,
CPA, Mexican Mall Lawyer, etc,
has erased any shread of personal-
ity you might have had left over
from prep school, then you will
feel right at home at KS.

—If you like to chase balls and
enjoy meals in which all four
courses are some type of meat

product, and who doesn’t, be a Phi

Delt.

—If you have a deep appreciation
of Southern Values and always
heard what a great place it was, but

_the same eight songs over and

have never actually been down
south, join KA.

—Ifyou like good bands, PiKA’s
the place to be. But if you like
good bands and crowds of no
more than, say, four, then SAE is
for you.

— I heard SPE has good food. It
must be true because that’s where
all the skunks hang out at night.
— If someone tells you that you
need to “clean your carb” and
you think about cars, then your’ re
a Phi Delt. If not, you’re PiKA
material.

— KA has been known to play

over during parties,so once
you go to one party you never
really have to go again.
—Ofcourse, KS has been known
to play country music so there is
really no reason to ever go
there.

In other words, each frater-:
nity is special in its own way, but
are all pretty much the same. It’s
your job to find one right for you.

afraternity, get recklessly drunk

Down With Swirl

Black? White?Black?
White? What is all of the fuss
about? The events that happened
in the past cannot be altered;
therefore, I feel that it is time to
stop dwelling so heavily on color
and take a deeper look at the
person inside.

For example, the question of
being: “down with swirl’. has
been a hot topic among the Afri-
can-Americans at Davidson for
some time now, considering that
the major alternative to dating
outside of our race here at
Davidson is the white male, and I
must say that I was rather shocked
when most black females replied,
“Tam NOT down with the swirl!”

Don’t get me wrong, I be-
lieve in each individual being en-
titled to his or her own opinion,
but as African-Americans we
should be the last to discriminate
on the basis of color. After all, do
we not constantly ask to be judged
by the content of our character
and our endeavors rather than by
the amount of melanin in our skin?
So, I ask, why are we repeatedly
judging our social partners based
on this same premise that we wish
to be eliminated in our behalf?

One answer I received after
asking this question to a group of
students shed light on the situa-
tion. Sakeitha Crowder, an Afri-
can-American here at Davidson,
replied, “Whoever said that they
[whites] were down with us?”
This question brings up a very
interesting point, and my advice
applies just the same to Cauca-
sians.

If you are a Caucasian-Ameri-
can, you should hesitate to’ judge
your social contacts on the basis of
color. After all, do you not insist
that there are satisfactory race re-
lations among the black and white
students here at Davidson? If the
relations are so good, why must the
majority of you shy away from
getting to know the small number: :
of African-Americans here?

I am asking all races to leave
the past in the past. I know that this
is definitely easier said than done,
but how can we as a people—race
aside—expect to advance if we are
insistentupon re-living historic tra-
ditions and a past that we can do
nothing to change?

Personally, Ihave experienced
both sides of the “swirl” and they
are actually rather similar if you
can mature past focusing on the
color of one another’s skin. You
can learn a great deal from those
that are different from you. Is that
not what college is all about? Are
we not here to learn new and excit-
ing things about cultures and races
other than our own?

Assuming we are here to learn
new things about one another, I
challenge each and every student
to be “down with the swirl!” I do
not mean for you to run out and
marry an individual of the oppo-
site race but rather you should get
a look into their background and
lifestyle. This is something that
you will not find in any history
book. After all, are we looking to
be intrigued by the person or by the
color of their skin?
