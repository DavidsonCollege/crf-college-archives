Winthrop 71 - Davidson 69

A three-pointer by Winthrop
guard DeCarlo Wilkins with 26
seconds remaining overturned a
one point Davidson lead, and gave
the Eagles a 71-69 victory over the
‘Cats Saturday night in Rock Hill.
Davidson looked to score without
a timeout on the ensuing posses-
sion, but were unable to do so. and
finally called a: timeout with :06
left. .

After two additional timeouts,
one by each team, Winthrop’s
Eddie Gay appeared to cross the
plane of the sideline to knock the
ball away from the ‘Cats Janko
Narat as he attempted to inbound
the ball. Such an action is punish-
able by a technical foul.

The referees made no call,
though, and, after another timeout,
Narat again inbounded the ball,
this time with Gay a good distance
away. He passed to James Marsh,
who returned the ball to him about

25 feet from the basket.
Narat dribbled to the three-

-point line, where he launched an

off-balance three-pointer against
double coverage. The shot glanced
harmlessly off the rim as time
expired:

Such a close finish was the
furthest thing from anyone’s mind
when the ‘Cats stormed to a big
early lead.

James Marsh started things off
on Davidson’s first possession,
curling through the lane for a
massive two-handed jam that sent
the unusually large Davidson con-
tingent of fans into frenzied hys-
terics.

Nine points from Jason Zim-
merman spurred the ‘Cats to an 18-
6 lead with about 12 minutes to
play in the half.

But the outside shooting of
Winthrop’s George Henson
sparked a 14-4 tear that brought
the Eagles within 22-20 with 7:19
left.

Winthrop finally drew even,

Cats Fall

To Three:

Eagles, Devils, Chants

despite the best-efforts of junior
Paul Drobnitch (7 first-half points),
on the final possession of the half,
and the teams were tied at 35 at
halftime.

Winthrop continued its run at
the outset of the second half,
moving out to its biggest lead at
49-42 with under 14 minutes left.
The ‘Cats fought back to tie the
game at 55-55 at the 8:01 mark,
before the two teams traded hoops
down the stretch.

Davidson was eaten alive by
Henson outside and Mark Hailey
inside, but countered with the
shooting of Zimmerman and Pat
Holloway and the inside play of
Marsh to stay close.

A free throw by Jason Zim-
merman with 1:11 left gave the
Wildcats a 69-68 lead before Wilk-
ins’ shot decided the outcome.

After the game, Davidson
coach Bob McKillop was “disap-
pointed” with his team’s lackadai-
sical defense, and felt they were
“lulled to sleep” by a false sense of
contentmentafter their strong start.

He also questioned the refe-
rees’ lack of gumption on the con-
troversial inbounds play. “That
should have been atechnical foul,”
he said. ““You’ll have to ask the
referees why atechnical foul wasn’t
called. Obviously, they didn’t want
to call it.”

Zimmerman, the Davidson’s
leading scorer at 12.0 points per
game, led the team with 20 points.
Both Holloway and Marsh added
12.

The ‘Cats shot 63% for the
contest, but allowed the Eagles to
shoot 58%. Davidson fell to 7-18
with the loss.

Duke 74 - Davidson 39

Wednesday night in Durham,
the Cameron Crazies were ready
for a blowout of gigantic propor-
tions, admonishing the Wildcats to
“Start the bus” before warmups
were even over.

In the end, they got a 74-39
blowout, but it came after an ugly
first half in which both teams shot
under 30% from the floor. Duke
led just 24-15 at the half.

The game got off to a predict-
able start when Duke’s Christian

_ Doubleheader

By Bruce Balestier
The Davidson baseball team
ended a four game losing streak

- Saturday by sweeping a double-

header against Big South oppo-
nent UNC-Asheville. The twowins

‘moved the ‘Cats to 3-4, 3-2 in the

Big South. They had fallento North
Carolina A&T and UNCC earlier
in the week, The Wildcats took the
first game by a 6-0 count, as senior
ace Dave Williams (2-0) hurled a
complete game shutout and Steve
Livesey had three RBIs. In the
second game, a 5-3 Davidson
triumph, the Bulldogs moved out

Laettner opened the scoring with a
baseline jumper. But six straight
points by the ‘Cats, four of them by
Janko Narat, put Davidson on top
6-2 with 17:23 left, and frustrated
the Duke crowd.

Though the Blue Devils pro-
ceeded to score 9 consecutive
points to take an 11-6 lead (they
would never trail again), the ‘Cats
continued to fluster them with
physical man to man defense. An
8-foot jump shot by Jeff Chapin
cut the lead to just 4 (19-15) at the
2:49 mark.

Of course, it couldn’ t last. The
5th-ranked Blue Devils scored the
final 5 points of the first half and
the first 5 points of the second half
inassuming a 29-15 lead with 18:03
left.

After a combination of great
Davidson defense and very cold
Duke shooting limited the Devils
to 28% shooting from the field in
the first half, they doubled it in the

second half, shooting 56% as the
lead swelled up to 39 points.

On the otherend, Duke’s trade-
mark man to man defense suffo-
cated the ‘Cats into 28 turnovers.
Davidson had to work'so hard just
to pass the ball that running an
offensive set was a luxury not of-
ten thought about.

The Wildcats shot just 26% for
the game.

Nonetheless, Duke coach Mike

~ Krzyzewski lavished tremendous
praise on the ‘Cats, j
“T think they’re doing it the
right way,” he said. “Itreminds me
of when we started here, sticking
to asystem and playing sound bas-
ketball.”
James Marsh led Davidson

to a 1-0 lead, but a third inning
grand slam by Joe Azzolino, his
second home run of the season, put

with 9 points and 7 rebounds. Pat
Holloway and Janko Narat added
8 points apiece.

Coastal Carolina 64 - Davidson
52

Think of your highschool gym,
only smaller and darker.

The picture you come up with
is the bandbox Coastal Carolina
calls “the Chicken Coop”.

Monday night, it was where
the Chanticleers outlasted the ‘Cats
by a 64-52 score.

The deceptively large final
margin obscured a gutty perform-
ance by Davidson.

Down 16-4 after 7 minutes of
play, the Wildcats inched back into
contention, drawing within 22-20
on a Paul Denmond layup with
under 3 minutes left in the half.

A late run by the Chants gave
them a 30-22 lead at the half.

Uncharacteristically, though,
the “Cats stormed out of the locker
room after halftime to score the
first.8 points of the second stanza
and tie the game at 30-30.

Then came another Coastalrun
that put them in front 41-31 with
13:13 left. Again the Wildcats came
back.

A free throw by Pat Holloway
with 2:10 left drew Davidson
within 52-48, and when the ‘Cats
full-court pressure paid off with a
turnover, they looked to be in great
position.

Unfortunately, a missed three-
pointer by Denmond on the ensu-
ing possession translated into two
free throws at the other end by
Coastal’s Robert Dowdell.

With Davidson forced to foul
to stop the clock, the Chants iced
the game at the charity stripe.

The ‘Catscontrolled the tempo
of the game with deliberate offen-
sive sets, shot the ball ata60% clip
and held Coastal to 40% shooting.

~ Unfortunately,23 turnovers (to
Coastal’s 5)’helped the Chants to
20 more field goal attempts,andan
8-18 (44%) performance at the line
only made matters worse for the
Wildcats, bes

Detlef Musch had 11 points to
pace the ‘Cats, Holloway had 9,
and James Marsh and Denmond
contributed 9 each.

Wanzenberg earned the victory to
