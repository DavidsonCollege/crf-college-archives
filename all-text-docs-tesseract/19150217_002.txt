THE ALUMNE BANQUET,

We all appreciate the spirit which
has prompted the Davidson — Alumni
Association to .arrange in) Charlotte,
during the Laymen's Convention, a ban-
quet for all those who are now, or have
been, connected with the college. It
seems to us another evidence of that
Davidson Spirit which is a thing re-
markable, even considering the loyalty
generally to be found among the Alumni
of the different colleges throughout the
country.

The ontiring efforts of the Associa-
tion, with Dr. Robt. H. Lafferty, tak-
ing a leading part, bids fair to. show
great results, with a large number pres-
ent. It is certain that every man whe
has at any time been connected with
the collere will be on hand. if it is at
all posible for him to be there. And
this is the principal thing. [t is thar
which makes a Davidson man, a friend
to every other Davidson man.  Whrat-
ever mav be the dividing lines in col-
lege, whenever Davidson Alnmai came
toecther, there is a feeling of friendshin
which cannot be equalled aovehere else
in the world. Mav this feeling cont nu
and grow and mav we who row held
in our hands those traditions of the col
lege, which are sacred in the ves of
every Davidson man, realize fully eur
responsibility. and opportunity, Mav
we. in the coming vears, be able ta at
tend a rathering such as that te be hell
in Charlotte, and remember with a feel-
ing of pride that we had come little part
in the makine of Davideon  strorger
and more worthy of. its Alumni.

BANQUET FOR MEN OF
DAVIDSON CHURCH

el

On last Friday evening the ladies of
the local Presbyterian church tendered
the men of the congregation a splendid
banquet in the Civic League rooms. ‘Che
purpose of the meeting and banquet was
to formulate plans for the attendance of
the local church men upon the Lay
men’s Convention in Charlotte. The
committee of ladies in charge, of which
Mrs. Paisley was chairman, had arrang-
ed the whole affair splendidly and fur-
nished a banquet which was thoroughly
enjoved by every one present.

Dr. C. M. Richatds acted as toast-
master. Prof. Currie, Dr. Sentelle, Dr.
Byron Clark of Salisbury, Der. Ar-
buckle, Dr. Martin, Dr. Lingle. Dr.
Shearer, Mr. C. L. Grey. and Dr.
Harding made speeches that added
greatly to the pleasure of the evening.
About forty of the men present pledged
themselves to attend the convention. At
the conclusion of the evening’s meeting
a unanimous vote of thanks was ren-
dered the ladies for their kindness and
a very nice donation was made them to
be used in the furtherance of the work
which they had planned to do this year.

JANUARY-FEBRUARY
MAGAZINE

As a whole, the recent issue of the

Magazine lacks much of reaching it’s|'

usual standard. Neither in quantity or
quality does it come up to the goal set
by ancordinary college magazine.

‘The poetry. with the exception ‘of
“Another Chance,” is almost entirely
lacking in thought and poetic expression.
This one poem has the virtue of being
written with same end in view, and is
to be commended for its sincerity, if
nothing else. ‘There are two stories in
this issue. “Thoughts” and a ‘Hollow
Mystery." The former shows a good

den| of imaginative power and origin: |
The one great fault to be found |

ality.
ith “A Hollow Mystery” ic thar the
nlot is based upon the came old skeleton
in the columns standing in front of
Chambers building, which has formed
“he foundation of so many other stories.
The writer’s style, however, is very
good.

Rryant’s Poetic Princinles. as a dis-
‘necian of this great poet's ideals and
is much too formal and
The writer wonld do well ta
cultivate a mare natural manner of
writing.  “Lonefellow's Secret of Find-
ing Readers and Retaining Them’ nor-
travs very well) indeed the simolicity
ond the nurity of this well loved Amer-
‘can poet.

THE CROWN OF CHARACTER.

There is a loftier ambition than mere-
,ly to stand high in the world. It is to
stoop down and lift mankind a little
higher. ‘here is a nobler character
than that which is merely incorruptible.
It is the character which acts as an anti-
| dote and preventive of corruption. Fear-
lessly te speak the words which bear
witness to righteousness and truth and
purity; patiently to do the deeds which
strengthen virtue and kindle hope in
your -fellowmen; generously to lend a
hand to those who are trying to climb
1 upward; faithfully to Rive your support
and your personal help to the efforts
which are making to elevate and purify
the social life of the world—that is what
-it means to have salt in your character.

protects; :

3. Because every policy is drawn to conform to the rigid
provisions of the Law.
