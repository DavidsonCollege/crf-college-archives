WDAV-AM To Broadcast
Spring Term, Says Dobbs.

By NEIL COGHILL
News Editor

WDAV, Davidson's AM
radio station expects to be-
gin broadcasting in the spring
term, according to Ed Dobbs,
station manager.

Dobbs,. who pioneered the
project in his freshman year
tated, “If everything runs
according to schedule, and
if we encounter no financial
or technical difficulties, we
ought to be ready to go by
the -beginning of the spring
term.”

Dobbs stressed, however,
that because of the immen-
sity of, the project and its
technical complexity ‘‘a lot
could go wrong.” WDAV re-
ceived renewed impetus from
a $500 donation from the
James F. Daniel Foundation
in South Carolina.

WDAV will be an AM sta-
tion rather than an FM as
fomerly intended. The rea-
sons for the change, Dobbs

Queens Protest Compels Curfew Change

By JOE SMITH
Associate Editor

A unanimous vote of the
student body has freed the
Queens girl of one of the
restrictions which has been
characteristic of women's
colleges, and Southern wo-
men’s colleges in particular,
from their inception: the in
famous “hours” regulations
are no longer in full éffect

been given to the curfew

dent demonstration which is
associated with it, tends to
obscure the fact that it is

involvement by its students

series

“The hours change is a
result of a recommendation
by the Residence Student

Council,” said Dean of Stu

dents Anne Gebhardt. “From
there, it was taken to the
Student Legislature, where

it was approved and sent to
the College Advisory
mittee,

ever, that they plan to wage
a massive. public relations
campaign preceding the first
broadcast.

“Most people don't realize
that this is an immense pro
ject,’ Dobbs said. “‘It’s not
like appointing a committee
or something. Once it gets
under way, it will be one
of the biggest things that has
happened to Davidson Col
lege in a long time.

“A number of people such
as Buck Lawrimore (Director
of the News Bureau), Skip
Smoak, and Dave Stimpson
have done an extraordinary

amount of work.
“We used a_ professional
planner, Richard Crompton

of Pennsylvania, to help us
set it up.” The station sent
its plans to Crompton, who
works with numerous radio
Stations, and he sent them
back suggesting the best pos-
sible set up.

Several other campuses in
the area already have sta-
tions, including N.C. State,
St. Andrews and Wake For-
est. WDAV hopes to eventu-
ally emulate Wake Forest's

Regulations Court Announces

On February 19, 1970, the College Regulations Court

fects the Property, Person or Rights of Others,” specifi-

PA Due to mitigating circumstances the court moved
u that’ the defendant »be verbally reprimanded and no
» further action be taken.

& However, the court would like to caution members
© of the college community about the potential serious-
t ness of entering-ldcked buildings.
Furthermore, it has been brought to the attention
t of the Chairman of the Court that the intramural fields
and cross country course are being damaged by the
riding of motorcycles over them.
Therefore in the future the riding of motorcycles

“T think that it is interest

knew that the walkout

Appeal Overturns
Honor Conviction

By JOHN McLEAN
Managing Editor

The Davidson College Court
of Appeals Tuesday night
overturned the conviction of
a student who had been found
guilty of cheating on a bi
ology review by the Honor
Court,

The student is the same
person who had_ previously
been convicted on a charge
of selling hallucinatory drugs,
but his sentence for that
charge had also been revoked

by the Court of Appeals
earlier in the term.
The Honor Court convic

tion had caused protest from
a number of students. (See
Feb. 20 issue of THE DA-
VIDSONIAN.)

A letter endorsed by the
SGA Senate was circulated
among the college community
which charged that the honor
court trial had been based
on “insufficient evidence”
and bore ‘‘too many marks of
a prejudiced and: non-objec:
tive hearing.” :

Sophomore Mark Meza,
one of the sponsors of the
Jetter, said that he was
pleased with the Court of
Appeals’ reversal, but said
that there is still a need to
review the college judicial
System.

He said that the proceed-
ings have been “indicative
of a system set up with the

best of intentions . . . but
(which has) taken more
power than it actually de
serves.”

Meza charged that the

Honor Court had engaged in
“moralizing rather_ than _ac-
tual judicial review.’

Meza stressed that his
views represented his own
personal opinions —and—net
necessayily those of the other
sponsors of the letter, or the
student government commit-
ee charged with. re-evaluat-
ing the Code’s judicial
