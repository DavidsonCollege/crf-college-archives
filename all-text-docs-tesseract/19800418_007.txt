Board Chairman John Willing-
ham said.

The ATC had a special meet-
ing Friday to consider the fate
of the Miscellany.

“There was a general concern

on the part of the ATC that the

Miscellany was no longer a

student activity. The ATC
wanted to make sure that
student money was used for

student activities,’’ Willingham f

If it were used for regular
housing, ‘‘there would be too
much intensity,”’ Bolding said.
This will not be the case with
only eight to ten o¢cupants.

Bolding also pointed out that
the house lacked the parking
space necessary for the number
of students usually living in an
off-campus house.

Shanks said he didn’t feel the
building’s location justified its
being restricted to women. ‘‘It’s
just as easy to find 8 quiet
guys,” he said.

Women will be selected for
the honors center on the basis of
involvement in campus life,
Bolding stated. The center is
available to women from all
classes.

‘‘There’s a basic need for
women’s programs,’ Bolding
explained, ‘‘and for a study
center for women.”

Associate’ Dean of Students
and Committee on Women’s
Concerns Chairman Sue Ross
said she hoped the women in the
center will form a “‘nucleus” for
discussions of women’s issues.

The center could work together -

with the Union minorities com-
mittee to organize programs,
she added.

An example of possible pro-
gramming, Ross said, would be
discussions with professional
women on “balancing a career
and home.”

Bolding said he hoped the
center would accomodate wo-
men from the whole ‘‘spectrum”’
of viewpoints, from ‘“‘liberal”
women to those advocating
“‘more traditional roles.’

sentiment for another fraternity
among CCRL members, Ross

-said the decision was made on

the basis of the opinions of the
majority of students and the
comparative benefits to future
students.
Assistant Dean of Students
Sue Ross, who presided over
Monday’s CCRL meeting, said
the council’s decision was influ-
enced by two straw polls. The
most recent, conducted on April
1, showed strong prefererice for

the second house to be coed as *

opposed to a new fraternity, all
girls’ house, or sorority. Three-
hundred seventy students fav-
ored a coed house, 127 favored
a new fraternity, and 2 each
favored an all girls’ house or
sorority .

said.

However, Miscellany Editor
Dave Roberts, advisor Julius
Winkier, and English Pr
Gill Holland convinced the Me-
dia Board, “:..that there was a
lot more student involvement
with the Miscellany than we
thought,”’ Willingham said.

‘We had considered not giv-
ing the Miscellany any money,”
Londrey said; but they made it
clear that this past issue with
little student participation was
an exception.” ‘

“The Miscellany is a student
activity,” Roberts said, ‘It
gives students interested in
literature a chance to edit
top-notch material and gives
them business experience.”

Roberts said about 15 stud-
ents work on the Miscellany
staff.

Londrey said that although
the ATC was satisfied with
Roberts’ presentation, ‘‘This
issue does need to be reexamin-

. ed in the future.”

The SGA approved the
ATC’s allocations —

—Focus on Athletics —

Despite ilies Ps ary
some athletes, such as baseball
player John Haskell, would

prefer the football program cut

entirely. Others disagreed, say-—
ing the present level of competi-

tion is realistic. Perkey said

that dropping to Division III .
would not save any money,,

since there are no Division III

* schools in North Carolina, so

that travel expenses would be
higher. Soccer player Doug
Schuessler observed that there

was little financial data avail-.

able about athletic funding.
From what he has seen, how-
ever, Schuessler said, “they go
above and beyond’’ what is
needed for a competitive team.

Rhyne had a number of
specific proposals on how to

‘reduce football costs. He sug-

gested that there be more
recruiting in North Carolina,
that spring football and some of
the assistant coach positions be
eliminated, and that scheduling
of games be made more econom-
ical. Rhyne pointed out that a

tet ae

objected to the moral basis of
recruiting. “‘A distorted view is
given in recruiting,’’ Haskell,
said, and, although’ this is

‘common practice, “we should-

n’t set our moral standard on
what other schools do. There’s a
high level of honesty in minor
sports.”’ Generally, minor
sports athletes emphasized that
their goal was not to hurt the

‘major sports. ‘“‘They should be

kept in perspective,”’ Marshall
said. Haskell concluded, ‘“To be
realistic is the most important
thing.”
