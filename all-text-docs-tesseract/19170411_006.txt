WITH OTHER GOLLEGES.

The Technique and Yellow Jacket—
A call for volunteers has come to the
students at Georgia Tech to enlist in the
Corps of Engineers. ‘The Secretary of
War has removed all preliminary tests
and formalities so that now the question
of appointment rests solely on the com-
petitive examination to .be held during
the week beginning June 25, 1917.

* * *

College Topics—A mass mecting was
recently held at the University of Vir-
ginia which was attended by the Fac-
ulty and over 1,000 students. Resolu-
tions were adopted pledging their sup-
port to President Wilson and their in-
tention to install a system of military
training as a means of preparedness.

* * *

The Vanderbilt: Hustler—Two hun-
dred and four students at Vanderbilt
signed up for military training and defi-
nite plans are being outlined for the
formation of the companies. The Co-eds
are not behind ia these days of prepared-
ness, and‘ twenty-five have signed up a-
Red Cross nurses and have — signified
their willingness to go to the front.

The Trinity Chronicle—Vhe students
at Trinity College also endorsed military
training at an enthusiastic mecting,
where about 300 men voted for it. Phe
Faculty has granted their petition and
an officer will be on the campus to take
charge after the Easter holidays,

The Guilfordian—Vhe second annual
declamation contest for High  Schos!
girls in North Carolina was recenth
held at Guilford College, under the avs
pices of the two literary societies for th:
Co-eds. The representative frown James
town won the contest.

The Cadet—Vhe world ot art and hi
manv friends mourn the death of Sir
Moses Evekiel, the noted sculptor, who
died in Rome on March 7. He was a
loyal alumnus of the V. M. f., graduat-
ing in 1866, a member of the famous
class that ‘fought at the battle of New
Market. His statues of Virginia mourn-
ing for her dead and of “Stonewall”
Jackson will remain as his monuments

at the V. M. J.

Washington and Lee—Newspaper re-
ports of recent date state that fifty of the
students have’ organized an ambylance
corps, three hundred and ninety have
signified their willingness to accept the
government's offer for military training
in colleges and universities, and Pres
ident Henry Louis Smith has made ap
plication to the government for the es-
tablishment of such a corps. There are
about one hundred students who have
not taken any definite course of action as
vet.

TWO DEBATES TO BE HELD

(Continued from page ')
resented by Harley §. Garland and Flor-
ence M. Gaines, with H. Reid De Jar-
nette as alternate. R. W. Cousar will
serve as alternate against Emory.

This debate marks the close ot «
series of three between Emory and Dav
idson, the honors being equally divided
so far. Emory claims the distinction ot
never having lost a series, and is well
known for always putting out a team of
excellent debaters. Against them Dav-
idson is sending a strong ageregation.
and the contest bids fair to be a close
one.

The Roanoke debate is the first onc
ever held with that institution, and tho
Davidson manifestly has the unpopular
side of the question. her two men are
sure to be heard before the decision is
announced.
