Annual Backers Meet Board,
Swallow Censorship Verdict

By MARK WILENSKY
Managing Editor

Eight students met with the
Board of Trustees on Oct. 25
and seemingly agreed on the
fate of the 1973-74 edition of
“Quips and Cranks.”

The eight students were
representatives of the group
which had taken on the-issue
from the time it came about 0-
ver two weeks ago. At that
time it was decided by the
school administration that the
annual could not be printed in
the form in which it was sub-
mitted to the printer.

When College President
Samuel R. Spencer Jr. refused
to allow the yearbook’s
distribution an impasse was
reached. According to the
students. involved, the
president and his .ad-
ministration refused com-
promise and insisted on a
unilateral decision stopping
the book.

On Monday, Oct. 21, Spencer
affirmed the decision that the
book could not be printed and
informed students that their
only recourse was to appeal
to the Board of Trustees.
Student Government
Association President Blain B.
Butner and Yearbook Editor
Jeff George at that time
initiated such an appeal.

The students were given’

time before the Student Life
and Health Committee to
present their case. Frormn a
group claiming to be the
Davidson Organization for the
Protection of First Amend-
ment Freedoms, the eight
were chosen.

Their original plan was to
promote the idea that ‘“‘studen-
ts don’t lose their first amend-

ment rights as Americans -

upon entering Davidson.’’
This idea was proposed by a
multi-paged brief presented to
each committee member.

The brief contained
numerous letters and
documents by national

authorities on freedom of the
press. Also included were
telegrams of support from
national student leaders and a
letter establishing représen-
tation in case of a subsequent

The trustee decision to allow ARA Sla

law suit from Charlotte At-
torney Michael A. Sheely.

- After about fifteen minutes
of debate about the role of the
first Amendment in a private
institution, the talk shifted to
compromise. The students
were asked if the ad-
ministration had _ either
suggested or responded to the
idea of a compromise solution.

It was answered that they had

not.

_ The students were quick to
point out that at no time did
the administration encourage
then to appeal the decision.

“‘Is.itan accurate statement
then, that had you folded in
your tent, you Wouldn’t be
here now?’ a board member
asked. ‘‘That is correct,’’ an-
swered Butner. .

Eventually the discussion
got to the specifics of this
year’s Quips and Cranks. It
was decided that f— and b—-s--
was acceptable to the trustees
and to a majority of the
students. Despite the efforts of
some student representatives
to get back to First Amend-
ment issues, the meeting en-
ded there.

That same afternoon the
students went before the en-
tire board for the formality of
reaffirming the agreement
made with the committee. At
that time the longer of two
board-passed resolutions was
agreed to by the majority of
the students.

Before the trustee vote, the
students were asked to leave.
At that time an additional
resolution was” passed,
praising Spencer for his ac-
tions, calling for no specific
compromise and returning the
resolution of the issue to the
administration. —

The students were unaware
of the second resolution,
having been told it would deal
with the specific compromise.
“In effect, ’’ said one
representative, ‘‘nothing was
gained. They just reaffirmed
their right to do just what they
have been doing all along.”’

At a hastily called news con-
ference immediately
following the trustees’
meeting, Spencer claimed
that the administration had of-

ferred compromise
throughout the previous week.
However, at 1:30 p.m. that
same day ‘‘Charlotte News”’
Réporter Sherman Harris
quoted Spencer as agreeing
with students’ claims that the
administration had refused to
negotiate a compromise
solution. The students were
unanimously against Spen-
cer’s statement to the press,
calling it “misrepresenting -
bordering on false.”’

The issue ended with
Trustee Chairman Warner
Hall staging a personal verbal
attack on a student represen-
tative. Hall contended that the
student insinuated that Spen-
cer lied to the press.

At this time, Yearbook

Editor Jeff George has agreed

to a compromise with ad-
ministration officials. George
says the book. will be
distributed to students before
the end of this term. :

The yearbook will contain f--
- and b—-s—- instead of the full
words. Pictures of streakers
will have male genitalia
covered.

November 1, 1974.

BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD
Yearbook Editor Jeff George is redesigning the pages of the
1973-74 Quips and Cranks to meet with administration approval.
George, hoping for no further delay, expects the books to be dis-
tributed this term.

Trustees Resolve Beer Issue

By RICHARD ROMEYN
Senior News Editor

In addition to considering
the problems . regarding
publication of last year’s year-
book, the Davidson College
Board of Trustees passed
resolutions concerning such
varied issues as governance,
the sale of beer on campus,
student housing, and a
proposed public service radio
station.

A major portion of last
week’s conference was
devoted to governance. The
trustees approved in principle
anew college constitution and
new faculty by-laws, action
which College President
Samuel R. Spencer Jr. called
“the major achievement of
the meeting.”

‘The student by-laws were

~also. submitted, but were not

approved. They will be

revised and submitted to the

board again in February.
Spencer said he expects that

ter to seek a heer license will revitalize the College Union.

the entire governance
package will be approved at
the February meeting, and
formally voted on in May. This
would mean that the new con-
stitution and associated
documents would go into ef-
fect with the 1975-76

SPENCER

school year.

The proposed package is the
result of four years of work on
the part of faculty, student
and administrative commit-
tees. :
The new system includes a
constitution and separate by-
laws for students, faculty and

trustees, eliminating many of °

the duplications and omis-
sions which characterized
the present system.

The decision by the trustees
to allow the sale of beer on
campus was the only major
action taken during the
meeting’ which will :affect
student life during this school
year.

The approved resolution
allows the ARA Slatér Com-
Pany to apply for an alcoholic

beer in the new student union
when it is completed.

Thus, the beer will be
available on campus
sometime after the first of the
year. Slater’s present contract
with the collegé, which grants
it exclusive rights to dispense
food and beverage on campus,
was cited by Spencer as the
primary reason why ARA
rather than the Union Board
was given permission to sell
beer.

The trustees also authorized
the administration to proceed
with an engineering survey to
determine the feasibility of
building a powerful public ser-
vice radio station on or near
the campus.

The results of this study will
be heard by the board during
its February meeting, and the
decision will be made then
whether or not to proceed fur-
ther. The proposed station
would be separate from
WDAV and would _ be
professionally — staffed.
However, it would also employ
Davidson students.

The fourth major action of
the trustees was to postpone
indefinitely plans to build
more student housing. The
current state of the economy
was cited as the major factor
in this decision, but if con-
ditions should improve within

.the next half year, new

housing is still a possibility for
the 1976-77 school year.
Student enrollment will be
frozen at 1300, the figure
which is regarded by ad-
ministration officials as the
“saturation point” of college-
owned and community hous-
