In one of the best mectings since
Christmas, if not for the whole year, the
Eumenean Society last Saturday night
held a spirited debate on the subject,
“Resolved, That Congress should create
a Minister of Munitions and a War
Council.” All the debaters showed that
thev had worked on the subject, and the
rumber of good points brought out re-
vealed this work. ‘The affirmative was
represented by Matthews, Mitchell and
Liston; the negative by Flinn. C. B.
Robson and Orgain. The affirmative
contended that the present plan was not
as efficient as it ought to be, that the
proposed plan was better, that it would
aid the President, that it would cen-
tralize the management of the war, that
it had proven a success in England, Con
sidering what a poor side the affirmative
had to start with, all the debaters did
pretty well. The negative contended
that our present plan is not a faiure, that
the proposed plan will only complicate
matters, that it would decentralize au-
thority, that it is contrary to the Consti-
tution, that the very men the affirmative
quotes for authority have acknowledge]
that the War Department has been twire
as efficient in putting soldiers in France
as was expected. The judges decided
in favor of the negative. Several gentle-
men follawed the Congressional plan of
rising to explain this, that. and the oth-
er, much to the amusement of the House.

The debate proved one thing: that if
vou want to have a debate interesting.
have an interesting subject. When we
get hack to discussing some old worn-
out subject like “capital punishment” 1
will want to throw up my job.

McGirt gave a declamation on “Civil-
ization’s Debt to Athens,”

PHT SOCIETY

At the meeting of the Phi Society
Saturday night, the regular exercises
were suspended and officers were elected

R. B. Peters, second critic.

Tt was decided to initiate the members
of the Junior Society into the Senior
Society at the meeting at which the new
officers are to he installed.

THE NEAREST STAR.

In the American Magazine John
Brashear says:

“Tf you could ride from the earth ta
Alpha Centauri on a train going at the
rate of a mile a minute, you would reach
your destination in forty-eight million
years. At the rate sound travels, if a
song were to be sung on Alpha Centauri.
it would be three million eight hundred
thousands vears hefore we could hear it.
This neighbor of ours is thirty-five tril-
lion miles away. A spider's thread from
a cocoon reaching to it would weight five
hundred tons.

Not Metered.

“Maxie,” queried the teacher of the
juvenile class, ‘what is the difference
between electricity and lightning?”

“You don't have to pay nothing for
lightning,” answered Maxie—Chicago
News.

“Our earth in its revolutions on its
own axis and its trip around the sun and
outward into space makes a journey of
nine hundred and eighty-four million
miles a year: but the old clock never
varies; there is never a jar or tremor,
and we are back again on the hundredth
of a second. Do you know it would have
cost me one billion five hundred million
dollars if I had had to pay mv way so
far at the rate of two cents a mile during
my journey of seventy-five years?”

To ride from the earth to Alpha Cen-
tauri tvould cost seven hundred billion
dollars.
