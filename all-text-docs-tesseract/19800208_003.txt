voracious appetite for books:

“Leland Park once told me
that I accounted for two and a
half percent of the library’s
annual circulation,’ he noted.
“Thave always been a ravenous
reader.”

But Brinkley denies having
had the highly visible rubber
stamp especially made for check
ing out books.

“I’m. a magpie...at nine years
I received a printing set with
rotary press and sticks. Some-
how most of the set was given
away.”

“T was just provoked at how
long it took to sign out so many

books, so I remembered the

remaining segment. with my
name on it and carried it around
in my pocket to check out
books.

The little red wagon rumor,
however, proves more substan-
tive. “I did use a wagon when I
had a particularly large amount
to carry home,’’ stated Brink-
ley, “for example, when I read
the Warren Commission report
on President Kennedy’s assas-
sination.”’

Brinkley’s former colleague in
the philosophy department,

Brinkley discussed his’

Earl MacCormac, quickly
points out that Brinkley’s om-
nivorous reading stems not

‘from some sort of self- dare, but
- out of genuine interest. ‘¢

“Occasionally I would ‘come

across a book or article which he’

had not read, and sheer panic
would come into his eyes,’’ said
MacCormac. ‘“‘Not that he had
not read it, just that he wanted
to read it.”

‘‘Alan Brinkley has ‘atl

. more now than I will read in my

lifetime,’’ added MacCormac,
himself an avid_reader.

Not only does Brinkley read
books; he collects them as well,
15,000 of them at interview
time.

And if that is not enough, he
writes books, or at least has
‘‘several novel projects’ at
hand. Quoting Andre Gide on
having read Nietzsche as a
middle-aged man, he remarked
on one of the drawbacks of
extensive reading: ‘‘Having
read at least a certain critical
mass, I am so much aware of all
of the things that have already
been done.’

MacCormac indicated that
Davidson lost more. than just

242% of its library circulation

when Alan Brinkley left. “‘Dav-

without Alan on the faculty,”

4 workshops close out active season

By AIDA DOSS

Features Editor
The great god of drama has
certainly raised his creative
head at Davidson this winter.
Four drama workshops, pro-
duced. entirely: by students,
have already been staged, as

well.as Under: Milk Wood,: the

major winter production. Two
more pairs of ‘one-act plays will
be presénted before spring
break. ST sh Se

The first set is a pair of
murder mysteries—Ron Co-
wen’s Book of Murder and

~ Lucille Fletcher’s Sorry, Wrong

Number.’’ Cowen’s play, di-
rected by Karen Weir, is a
showcase for actresses. The plot
revolves about three ex-wives
and the current fourth wife of a
rich old writer. The staging uses
flashbacks, with lighting chan-
ges for emphasis. The cast
features Mark Murray as the
writer; Sheri Gravett, Claire
Abernathy, Loy Thornton, and
Mary Carpenter as the four
wives; and David Barber as the
detective. Weir commented that
the wives’ names (Anne, Cath-
erine, Jane, and Mary) and the
writer's name, Henry, all allude
to the historical Henry VIII and
some

tic irony. >

“Sorry, Wrong Number’’
may be more familiar to sus-
pense fans. Set in the late
1930's, the play focusses on one
bedridden woman, portrayed by
Anna DeArmond, who over-
hears a murder plot’ on her
telephone. The consequences
which follow give plenty of
opportunities for fine acting and
staging. The play is directed by
Janet Ward Black. ,

During the ninth week ‘of the
term, the final two workshops
will be presented. Lithuania,
directed by’ Eugene Heath, was
penned by Rupert Brooke, one
of the Georgian poets of the
first World War, and is his only
play. The plot. is supposedly
based on a true story which

Brooke either read in a news-'
paper or heard in a cafe. In the’

play, one rather poor family,
consisting of an_insensitive
daughter, a demoralized father,
and a mother trying to hold
them all together is visited by a
rich stranger. .The family is

' the father,-and Roger Farrabee,

the stranger. Rounding out the
cast are Eric. Sonner, Ed Gay-

‘nor, Steve Sechrist, and Mark

Halton.

In contrast to Lithuania’s
somewhat moralistic tone, John
Bewen’ s The Waiting Room is a
contemporary suspense drama.
Ted Jones, director of the play,
described it as ‘‘a very dramatic
piece” which is not (@ mystery
but which is ‘‘full of surprises.”
