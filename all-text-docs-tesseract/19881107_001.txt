Not Beyond Davidson: News about town

By STAN HUMPHRIES
As the national elections approach, the
- sleepy North Carolina town of Davidson
comes alive with political discussions
erupting everywhere about town.

In hot pursuit of the opinions and insights
of the Davidson community, The
Davidsonian thought it best to talk to folks
at some of our local establishments to get
their insights.

"The general feeling of the town seems to
be that of utter disgust at the whole affair,
but nobody is particularly angered or
moved to activism about their disgust. In-
stead, the town seems fairly indifferent to
the upcoming elections.

Itis a quiet kind of disgust as one resident
‘summed it up best by : saying “Frankly, we

-just don’t give a damn.”

One prominent Davidson resident grew
weary of discussing the elections and in-
stead preferred to discuss a particularly
interesting “Oprah Winfrey” show al-
though she admitted that “‘this show is just
pitiful.”

Discussions at The Anchor Grill, a popu-
lar Davidson dining spot, were lively as
both patrons and employees delved into the
big issues while drinking beer and listening
to Jeopardy in the background. One patron
addressed both candidates and said of

them, “they’re both just-like-two snotty
<

inside’

school kids” and “Neither tiéed to be presi-
dent.”

Jan Machalek, an employee of The An-
chor Grill, said that regardless of who wins,
“the rich are going to get richer, the poor are

going to get poorer and the middle class is .
going to slide like hell.” Machalek de- —
scribed Dan Quayle as “a damn spoiled,
rich kid.” When asked how she believed —

President Reagan had led the country for
the past eight years, Machalek asked, “Do

-you really think Reagan’s been running this
country? His damn wife’s the one in”

charge.”

Another Davidson resident also- com-
mented that the only reason she had voted
for Reagan was “because I used to listen to
him on the radio when he did that show
called “Mule Train.’”

Keith Davis, another patron of the Grill, -

addressed many other issues; on the judi-

cial system Davis commented, “I don’t —

know any judges worth killing”; on state
taxes “it’s the damn Baptist driving up

. taxes with them blocking the state lottery”; _
on foreign aid: “we’re.giving away money ~
to no-good, dawg-gone, damn ignorant —

sons of bitches and I hear even to the com-

. munists.”
For a subtle change of pace, theownerof |
Sher Komien Eye deneue matters while =f

ground. He desta with the community

sentiment that there had been too much

back-stabbing in the campaigns of both
candidates. The owner commented that he
“would just as soon see Reagan stay in
office.” He voiced concern over Dukakis’
stand on gun control but said that the coun-
try really had “to do something about all
this damn hi-jacking.”
Stressing Dukakis’ image of promoting
increased government regulation, he
chuckled and stated, “I reckon he’ll want to

move the. drinking age up to forty-five too
and I doubt you'll like that one bit.” He

was, of course, correct that I wouldn’t like

that one bit.
Other news:

New pool table covers at The Korner Pub
so everyone is encouraged to go on down
and try them out.

Reservations are not needed at The
Anchor Grill. Ever.

Catching. the lead of the Huntersville
Funeral Home who had its open house
several weeks ago, the Lake Norman
Medical Park announced that they will be
having their open house soon. If a tour of
the embalming facilities at the new funeral
home didn’t satisfy you, then come on
down to 3 medical path ray
