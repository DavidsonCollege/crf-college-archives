6 : THE DAVIDSONIAN MONDAY, OCTOBER 7, 1996
Political Perspectives ; The Davidsontan
Professor Why hasn’t Bob Dole’s Beyon d Di WV Id son
Ton Eizes campaign taken off? A. a
With about a month to go be- ment. Second, this is an election far is that voters don’t appear to be plc calis

fore the presidential election, pub-
lic opinion polls show President
Clinton maintaining a double-digit
lead over Republican Bob Dole.
Perhaps most notable about
Clinton’s lead is that it has re-
mained remarkably stable for the
last two months; the post-conven-
tion “bounce” enjoyed by the Re-
publicans didn’t last very long, and
six weeks of intensive campaign-
ing has caused little change in voter
preferences.

It would be premature, of
course, to conclude that no dra-
matic changes in the fortunes of
the candidates will occur during
the next month. We’ve only seen
one of several debates, forexample,
and a Clinton or Dole gaffe or
unforeseen event could shake
things up considerably.

Absent such surprises, one
might ask why the 1996 campaign
has failed to stir the electoral pot in
exciting or unpredictable ways.
One factor, to be sure, is the differ-
ent role played by Ross Perot this
year. Four years ago, he was seen
as a somewhat eccentric but seri-

ous candidate who offered a fresh —

alternative to the major party can-
didates. Now Perot is simply ec-
centric, But the major problem
facing Bob Dole is that he cannot
“frame” the election in ways that
will work to his advantage. That
is, he hasn’t been able to get voters
to see this election as being about
issues or themes that advantage
Bob Dole, and disadvantage Bill
Clinton.

What does Dole want voters
to think that this election is about?
Thus far, the Republican campaign
has told voters that, first, this is an
election about the size of govern-

about trust (translation: candidate
character). The premise of the
GOP campaign is that if voters see
this election primarily as choice
between candidates with compet-
ing visions of the role of govern-
ment in our lives, Bob Dole will
win. Or if voters see the choice as
a referendum on the integrity or
character of the candidates, Dole
will win. On both counts, Dole’s
advisers are correct. The problem

is that their efforts to frame the’

choice in terms of these two issues
have thus far failed.

How do you run against Big
Government? Cut its lifeline:
taxes. Dole promises a 15% tax
cut (remember Dole in his nomi-
nation acceptance speech in San
Diego: “IT’S YOUR MONEY?”),
promises to “end the IRS as we
know it,” and promises to balance
the budget. Though such promises
are popular with voters, this year
the Big Government issue appears

to have taken a back seat to the /

Healthy Economy issue. A New
York Times/CBS News poll of sev-
eral weeks ago showed that almost
three-fourths of Americans think
the economy is “good” or “very
good,” and 55% approve of the
way Clinton is handling the
economy. :

How do you run on Charac-
ter? Emphasize Bob Dole’s im-
pressive military career (and let
voters draw the contrast with

Clinton), and remind yoters of the

“moral looseness” of the Clinton
administration, especially with re-
spect to the drug issue. As Dole
has said often on the oe
trail, “we said ‘just say no.’”;

Clinton says, ‘just say nothing.”
The problem for Republicans so

buying the character contrast —
perhaps because, for better or
worse, they simply don’t see char-
acter as a critical issue for presi-
dential leadership.

Republican frustration with
their failure to make voters see the
election in frames that will advan-
tage Dole is growing, and it seems
inevitable that they will consider
other frames (foreign policy? trade?
immigration?). Since few issues
are obvious winners for Dole —
which is largely due to Clinton’s
election year success in defining
himself as a centrist — the Repub-
licans will be sorely tempted to
turn up the heat on the character
issue. If the trust theme hasn’t

- worked so far, some advisers might

suggest, perhaps it is because Dole
(and his surrogates) haven’t hit
hard enough. The last month of the
campaign, then, might feature an
increasingly negative and hard-hit-
ting attack on Bill Clinton’s char-
acter.

It remains to be seen whether
the Republicans will move in this
direction or, if, they do, whether
such a campaign would be effec-
tive.

As November 5 nears, how-
ever, Dole’s strategists may con-
clude that the Big Government
frame is a loser, and that they’ve
handled the Character issue with,
well, too much character. From
this point of view, the only themes:
that might resonate. with voters —
the only “issues” that would truly
distinguish Bob Dole and Bill
Clinton — are distinctions based
on character.

If so, hold onto your seats, for
the campaign will take a different,
and probably nasty, turn

Yasir Ishaq :

Why is Nations Bank, along
with the Dean Rusk Program in
International Studies, sponsoring
a conference on U.S.-China rela-
tions?

Have there been any conflicts,
or arguments between the two
countries? What have the Chinese
ever done tothe U.S. or vice-versa?
What are the underlying factors in
this power relationship that have
kept both parties on guard for the
past few decades?

Hopefully, this week’s con-
ference will answer some of these
questions and perhaps shed some
light on the future of U.S.-China

relations.
: With the collapse of the So-
viet Union and the strong U.S.
presence in the Middle East, only
China remains a dominant force in
the future.

Since the Open ee policy in
the ‘70s, China’s economy has
skyrocketed and the country has
become one of the world’s leading
superpowers, both militarily and
economically.

Why China?
A look at the questions behind
this week’s China-U.S. Conference

While the country has ben-
efitted from economic success, the
issue of human rights and other
social conditions have been shoved
under the table for the sake of
economic prosperity.

The question is, who is re-

sponsible for this so-called “suc- .

cess”?

The communists have indeed
helped China, but in the meantime
have sacrificed human equality and
other basic rights.

How did the Chinese applica-
tion of communism have such dy-
namic effects on the economy?

The communists inChinaeven
to this day believe that Taiwan is a
province of China and with their
assertive military; they may even
use this power to take over Taiwan
in the near future. :

In addition, will China give
aid and arms to Pakistan in their
conflict with India?

Will China be awarded the

Most Favored Nation Status un- -

conditionally and permanently?
Permanently granting MEN status

might give U.S. entrepreneurs a
boost in their own free-markets
within China.

Where does the U.S. fit in?

The United States believes that
establishing strong ties with China
will lead to peace and prosperity
throughout the world.

The U.S. is also concerned
about the current state of human
rights in China, and perhaps be-
lieves U.S. intervention-democ-
racy could be established one
day.

The U.S. does not want China
giving arms to either India or Paki-
stan, knowing internally that a
strong conflict could arise.

What about Taiwan?

The U.S. hopes that China
will reopen diplomatic talks with
Taiwan and that they will both
work together to construct a mu-
tual peace agreement.

This week’s the conference
on China will perhaps help us solve
some of these puzzling questions
and give hope to a new aspiring
power relationship.

Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu returned to Israel last
Thursday following a two-day summit in Washington D.C. No formal
statement was issued at the summit’s conclusion, but peace talks
between Palestinian and Israeli officials were to resume on Sunday.
Following a string of violent eruptions along the West Bank two weeks
ago, Netanyahu began to pull tanks from the area and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat ordered his forces to put an end to rioting as well.

Although December 20 has been declared the ‘pullout date’ for NATO
peace forces in Bosnia, 10,000 U.S. forces will remain. These U.S.
Army soldiers will serve as a ‘covering force’ as NATO operations
leave. According to U.S. Defense Department schedules, by early
February only 750,000 soldiers will remain in Bosnia and all forces
will have departed Bosnia by the middle of March.

A Peruvian jetliner plunged into icy Pacific waters Wednesday morn-
ing after the pilot informed the control tower that computers seemed to
be malfunctioning and he had lost his bearings. 70 people were aboard
the craft.

Poland’s Senate rejected attempts to liberalize the country’s abortion
laws last week. However, Poland’s lower chamber, which passed the
liberalization law in late August, can override the Senate’s ruling. The
law would allow women to obtain abortions as late as the 12th week of
pregnancy, if they face difficult social or economic situations.

A man who kidnapped a seven year-old Oregon girl was killed in
Yoncalla, Oregon last Thursday when a police sharpshooter shot him
in the head. The unidentified kidnapper took Kristina Jacobson from
her babysitter’s home Thursday morning, stole the sitter’s car, and led
police on a car chase at speeds of 110 mph. He was shot after the car

jhe.was driving flipped, Jacobson suffered only minor injuries.

Gangs are no longer forced to spread their name by spray-painted
buildings and bridges. Increasing numbers of gang members are
logging onto the Internet, forming ‘gangsta sites’ to attract recruits and
post names and addresses of gang rivals. Officials say they fear that
gangs’ internet presence could evolve into drug distribution connec-
tions.
