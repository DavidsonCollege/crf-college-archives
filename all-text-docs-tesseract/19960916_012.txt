SEX IN MUSIC VID£OS

“90% of music videos are directed by men”

TYLER Epp
Guest Writer

Thursday night in the 900
Room, Dreamworlds 2, a docu-
mentary outlining desire, sex, and
power in music videos, was shown
to over 50 interested Davidson stu-
dents. The video focused on how
males in today’s society view
women; what effects the seductive
images of music videos have on
how men and women interact with
one another; and how these images
affect how men and women think
about sex.

Dreamworlds 2 consisted of
approximately 45 minutes of clips
of seductive videos including Ma-
donna, the artist formerly known
as Prince, the late Tupac Shakur,
and L.L. Cool J., among others.
Clips of their videos were flashed
between comments by the narrator
such as the fact that 90% of music
videos are directed by men.

Women were viewed as vic-
tims of the situation, however, only
one artist, Amy Grant, was inter-
viewed to give her opinion on the
Situation. This point raised great
emotion in the discussion follow-
ing the viewing. A number of
students, male and female, felt that

women were being portrayed as
victims and were given no room
for space or pleasure.

Another poirt of concern
among the audience was Madonna,
both as an artist and an activist.
Members of the viewing audience
felt that Madonna had gone from
an activist for women’s rights in
the 1980s to aconformist of sexual
fantasies in the 1990s.

Many of the male members of
the audience were insulted by the
video’s presentation of a typical
male fantasy. : According to
Davidson students, the single fan-
tasy for men depicted in
Dreamworlds 2 is not the only
fantasy men have.

It was also called to the atten-
tion of the viewers that the same
videos were played over and over,
singling out clips of erotic dancers
and men and women involved in
sexual acts. To make more of a
statement, the video would have
been better had it included ex-
amples from many different genres
of music.

It was also important to re-
member throughout the video that

videos are a way of advertising for -

the artists who will do whatever
they can to make an impression.

The American public, Davidson
students included, respond to many
of these rather provocative videos
which is why artists can get away
with producing them.

Overall, the viewers felt that
Dreamworlds 2 was a well-done
piece of propaganda and did an

’ outstanding job presenting its ar-.

gument. Although it perhaps took
things out of context and manipu-
lated the artists, Dreamworlds 2
spurred a great deal of positive
discussion about issues affecting
our sexual attitudes toward each

R.E.M. takes New Adventures

By JEFF FULLER
Guest Writer

When I heard that the title of
the new R.E.M. album would be
called New Adventures in Hi-Fi, I
feared that this old Athens-band-
turned-superstars would go over
the edge with their sounds, forsak-
ing their roots completely and be-
gin over-experimenting. However,
when I listened to New Adven-
tures, I found echoes of past al-
bums like Out of Time, Automatic
for the People, Monster and maybe
even a murmur from their early
years finely blended to deliver a
diverse, yet solid album. ©

In their new album, R.E.M.
uses some of the loud, grinding
electric guitar sound that was so
ubiquitous on Monster, their last
album. But with this new album,
they seem to have much more con-
trol over the sound, without drown-
ing out Michael Stipe’s esoteric
lyrics. “The Wake-Up Bomb,”
“Departure,” and “Undertow” in
particular contain crisp, dominant
vocals. Although R.E.M. allows
the lyrics of “So Fast, So Numb”
and “Leave” to fade in parts, they
do not fade into unintelligible
mumble as they did on Monster’s
“Let Me In.”

R.E.M. contributes to the
strength of New Adventures by
varying its instruments and musi-
cal styles. While they improve on
techniques begun in Monster,

_they venture into their musical at-
tic, blowing off the dust of some of
their old sounds to create effective
new songs. “Electrolite,” one of
the best songs on the album, com-
bines haunting piano music remi-
niscent of “Nightswimming” with

the rhythm of “Man on the Moon”
to create a musical landscape
evocative of the song’s subject, a
starry ride up L.A.’s Mulholland
Drive.

The lyrics of “Electrolite”
could hold the idea behind the title
of the album: New Adventures in

Hi-Fi — new adventures in old‘

forms. “‘Electrolite” waxes nostal-

gic (in lines like “I’m Steve

McQueen, I’m Jimmy Dean,”) but
also looks to the future when Stipe
tells the 20th century “go and sleep/
You’re Pleistocene.” The lyrics, if
read metamusically, reflect
R.E.M.’s need to use their old
sounds, but take them one step
further.

In “E-Bow the Letter,” the
first release from the album,
Michael Stipe conversationally
delivers lyrics as he did in “Coun-
try Feedback,” while the voice of
Patti Smith mystifies the listener.
This song seems to be more of a
progression from albums like Au-
tomatic for the People and Out of
Time than Monster. Although the
musical roots lie with the latter
two albums, the song has a refined
seriousness which would make it

_ very much out of place on either of

those albums. One could never put
“E-Bow the Letter” alongside
inane songs like “Shiny Happy
People.”

. Other songs worth noting in-
clude: “Bittersweet Me,” which
alternates different guitar sound,
developing a sound which ends up
being a cross between their early
songs and songs from Monster.

Some of the album’s weak- —

nesses include too much reliance
on instrumental repetition as the
background for a few of the songs.

Although this technique workis in
“Departure” and “Blinky the Door-
mat” where repetition is the driv-
ing force for the song, it does not
work as well in “Be Mine.” Per-
haps the pace of that song is too
languid for too much repetition. In
“Leave” the violent fire-alarm-like
repetition emerges forcefully after
atender acoustic introduction. The
annoying repetition fades into the

NEW ADVENTURES

background, but the song would be
much more effective without it.
In their new album, R.E.M.
does a good job of gathering its
strengths and taking them one step
further. The result is a thoroughly

enjoyable album, which will sat- .

isfy fans of any era of R.E.M.’s
music. At the same time, the al-
bum would make a great introduc-
tion to anyone new to R.E.M.
