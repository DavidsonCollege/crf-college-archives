CHINA, from page 5

was shocked at the harshness
of the government's action
against the students. After the
brutality of their actions, it was
essential to. the government
that they cover it up, he said,
noting that they would be
unable_to explain to_ their
people that they told the army
to fire upon: unarmed stu-
dents. The cover-up wasa logi-

cal step in the government's »

handling of the entire affair, he
said.
Holland does not think that
the Chinese believed the gov-
ernment’s. lies; however, he
said it is unlikely that they
would directly express their

beliefs. It is very dangerous to
live in China at this time, he
said, likening living in China
to living in Orwell's 1984.

“It was not prudent to ask
questions,” he pointed out. A
person could be jailed for
being a “rumor-monger.” It
was a bad time to bea student,
teacher, or a worker, as they
were being executed fre-
quently, and there was word
of secret executions as well, he
added.

Holland mentioned that
most of his knowledge of the

‘situation around him came
from talking to people and lis-
tening to.shortwave radios. He
had access to people whoacted
as interpreters to students.
These people would return

and tell them what was hap-
pening. He wasalso able to see
a great deal from the street
where his house was located
for it led right into Tiananmen
Square. People wanted to
know what was going on, but
they were reluctant to ask
someone for fear of getting
that person in trouble, Holland
said. :

“You did not want to cheer
others on to a tragic end,” he
said. “You did not want to in-
trude, nor did you want to
treat the affair as entertain-
ment.”

WSOC, WBTV and The Char-
lotte Observer used Holland asa
resource in their news stories.
He confirmed reports of the
massacre by telephone. and

added to them by talking to the
people in his hotel.

Holland said that calls out
were monitored; it was best to
wait for the television station
tocall him rather than trying to
call the television station him-
self.

The American Embassy
moved the Hollands from uni-
versity housing toa hotel close
to the embassy--fearing that
the university would be prime
target for the army. The boule-
vard that the hotel was located
on led straight into the square.

The Hollands were told to
leave soon thereafter. They
were driven out to the airport
through two barricades.

There was‘a rumor circulat-
ing that the army would be »

3
going after the airport, he
said. There was a possibility
that there would be no seats
left on the planes. They were
fortunate to get seats, which
they purchased with foreign
currency. .

When the Hollands first ar-
rived in China and were
driven to Beijing, there were

hundreds—of_ people doing

exercises, on the side of the
street. The air was clear and
the sky was bright. °—

When they were driven
down that same ‘road several
months later, the scene was
entirely different. No one was
out--the fields were empty of
people and all the Hollands
could see were the remains of
wooden barricades.
