Joseph Wearn, of Charlotte. Wearn
Jost his life as a result of pneumonia
following Spanish influenza, He had
dropped out 8f college during his Soph
sear, and was living in Charlotte up to
the time of his enlistment. He had been
cager to enlist ever since war was de-
clared. His father dissuaded him, hold-
ing that he was too young, but one day
last May he made up his mind ‘to enlist,
and did. He was attached to the Fifth
Coast Artillery, at Fort Caswell, near
Wilmington. After being in the army
less than a month he went over, and his
death occurred the Jatter part of Oc-
tober in a Red Cross hospital in) France.

promising members of his class and his
withdrawal from college was greatly: re-

gretted. Quiet and pleasant, he was
soon well liked on the campus. His
classmates and others who knew him

will hear of his death with sorrow. Da-

memory of man runneth not to the con-

celebrate and some went to town, “Red”
Smith had a big celebration—smoked a
cigar.

they were paid their just dues. Some
got as much as $30, while one man got
only $1, It made no visible difference
how much they got—every man came
out with a smile on his face, for the ma-
jority of the men were prouder of that
money than anv they have ever made.
Some even talked af keeping it intact as
a souvenir.

“Take back your heart!! The bitter
words

“Take back your heart, base butcher
man:

You know I ordered liver !"—Ex.
