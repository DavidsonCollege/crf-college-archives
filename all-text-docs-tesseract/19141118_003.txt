November 6, Dr. Winfield Scott Hall,
one of the foremost sociologists of Amer-
ica. lectured to the Davidson students
under the auspices of the Y A.
Dr. Hall was formerly professor of hy-
giene and sociology in the Northwestern
University, but now he is traveling over
the entire United States for the ¥. M.
C. A., delivering lectures to students on
purity and high ideals of manhood.

Dr. Hall delivered two lectures, one
at 2:15 and the other at 7:15 p.m. Bot
were attended by practically the entire
student body as well as some of the men
from the town.

The object of his afternoon talk was
to explain how each one of us, who are
from the Aryan race, lives again in his
life the history of that greatest of all
races.

First in our race, said he, there came
the primacval man, from 10,000 to
6,000 years ago. ‘This era corresponds
to infancy. of which we «now practi-
cally nothing psychologically.

The next step was that of savagery.
which extended to 3,500 years ago. “The
people of this age were very emotional,
fetish worshipers, raft builders, cave
dwellers. This period corresponds to
childhood, from three to ten years, in
which toys and dolls are fetishes. and
when nothing so delights the boyish
heart as to build rafts and dig. caves.
Then came an upward step to barbarian
ism, extending to 1,500 years ago.
was in this stage of the race that woman
gave a home to man and became his
equal. The man was cruel and delight-
ed in the hunt. This age corresponds
to hovhood, fram ten to fifteen. when
the boy is cruel, dirty, and in truth a
little barbarian.

The following period was that of
chivalry, when woman gave society to
the race, and became the tadv of the
castle. and man had a code of honor to
his God. his king. his ladv, and himself.
This is the age of voung manhood, six-
teen to twenty-five, a time of daring.
chivalry and honor.

The era of chivalry merges into the
age of modernism, the time of today,
which is brighter and fairer than anv
other the world has ever seen. his is
the age of maturity and manhond, when
life is at its greatest and when man

generations of noble, indomitable blood.

And what of the coming age? Will
it be a time of advance or a period of
decadence? Dr. Hall claims that to-
morrow will be yet greater and brighter
than today, and that, as always, — the
ideals of today will become the great re-
alities of the tomorrow of the Aryan race.

DR. MIN'FER ON “GAMBLING.”

Continuing the November series of
talks on College Ideals and Problems,
R. Minter will speak to the
Christian Association next “Thursday
night on the subject of “Gambling.”
Dr. Minter is a very effective and at-
tractive speaker, and every man in col-
lege should avail himself of the oppor-
tunity to hear him.

Last. “Thursday night Dr. McGeachy,
of Charlotte, addressed the Association
on the third of the series, “Honesty.” In
his delightful, earnest way, he brought
a wonderfully practical message and left
a deep impression.

The Sunday Bible classes continue
with splendid attendance, the average so
far being between eighty and ninety per
cent. P. D. Patrick's class leads with
an attendance of one hundred per cent
to date. Several follow close behind.
