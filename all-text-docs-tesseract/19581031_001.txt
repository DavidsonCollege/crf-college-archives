By DAVID JORDAN
Davidsonian Staff Writer

John Kuykendall, President of the Student Council,
presented two proposed constitutional amendments to
the student body at chapel this morning, making pos-
‘session of firearms in college dormitories a student body
regulation offense.

President Kuykendall also outlined tentative plans
for the creation of an Honor Council, in the program
devoted in full to student government affairs.

Charles Rose’s feature (below) tells of the Davidson tradition of friendly greetings and cam-
pus courtesy. Informal contacts such as this between students and faculty have long been

regarded as an integral phase

of education at Davidson.

Campus Ciurtesy Is Traditional

Editor’s Note: The follow-
ing feature by Charles Rose
is the first in a series Ccealing
with Davidson Traditions.
These stories will be designed
to spotlight the origin and
present status of these time-
honored customs.

Whether we reatize it or not,
Davidson College is the unique
the outstanding institution that
it is. because of the traditions
that have remained with it
throughout its existence. To sin-
gle out any one and say that it
has been most responsible for
the uniqueness of Davidson,
would be an impossible task
because the reputation of this
college has grown to become
what it has as the result of
many upheld traditions. And
they have been upheld but for
one purpose — to offer to all
that come here the chance to
make of their lives as much as
they are capable of becoming.
This can be true at any institu-
tion of higher learning, but
many time proven traditions
have helped to make that goal
more easily attained at David-
som ,

likely to note is the friendly at-

of our little community because
of implications, A visiting ath-

a wealthy businessman may all
note our cordial attitude,
they may all have
ideas as to why Davidson is so
friendly. Yet basically we
should be friendly because we
like each other and don't want
to appear aloof or hostile.

A visitor to the campus in
1860 noted the attitude of the
Davidson students and wrote
the editor of the “North Caro-
lina Presbyterian” of his im-
pression.
