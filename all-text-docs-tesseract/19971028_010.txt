THE DA ipso

TUESDAY, OCT OBER 28, 1997

Not always what the press says, but what it doesn’t say

oes anyone remember the cute
little morality lessons at the
end of each G.I. Joe cartoon?

stories.

some relevant topic like illegal sub-
stances (that wasn’t a problem for me at
age 8).

G.I. Joe always ended the show
with seven words: “Remember kids,
knowing is half the battle.” Well, G.I.
Joe was right. Maybe knowing is even
more than half the battle.

Anyway, in this post-modern
world of ours, where everyone hides
behind computer screens and car win-
dows, knowing anything at all is a
miracle. What we do know about the
world around us is due in no small part
to the American media. Here at
Davidson College, that means the daily
New York Times or Charlotte Observer,

CNN, Headline News and for more
local events, the Davidsonian and
Libertas. :

Whatever. The point is that we

cynics, doubters, conspiracy theorists
and nonbelievers. And perhaps, this is
not without reason.

At Davidson, where we all smile
and greet each other like old friends and
no one even thinks of lying, there is the
assumption that such cynicism should
be withheld for the world outside. Each
of us tries our darndest to be fair and
upstanding.

Of course, that hasn’t stopped con-
troversy from occasionally creeping on
campus. Many of us may recall the
criticism the Davidsonian received just
last year for its allegedly liberal bias.
Well, yet another college publication
has been the subject of criticism in the
last few weeks. It is not the Davidsonian.
Itis not the Libertas, and God knows the
Oak Row Report didn’t slip up. No, this
time, it’s the Dean Rusk Program’s

monthly publication on international
affairs, the Toilet Paper.

No doubt, many of us have seen it:
After all, it’s rather difficult to avoid
when oneis sitting in an otherwise bare-
walled cubicle. Three pages. Lots of
pictures. Mostly of people being shoved
into car trunks and terrorized by the
Turkish armed forces. At the top, in
very large letters, it says TURKEY. So,
this is Turkey?

Perhaps you even bothered to read
a few of the articles. Let’s see. There’s

disagree with Chomsky, but he raises a
provocative and important point here.

The journalistic community’s
power does stem at least as much from
what it chooses not to write about as
what it chooses to write about. As an
amateur journalist, and more particu-
larly, the editor of the Toilet Paper, I
was disappointed with the quality and
the accuracy of our latest issue,,While
the articles written were by all means
objective and accurate, we failed to tell
the whole story.

bloodshed and serious human rights
violations. Those are facts.

But there are more facts than just
these. We could just have easily spent
two or three pages discussing the ambi-
tious and effective public health and
education programs that have been ad-
ministered by the Turkish armed forces
over the years. Perhaps we should have
focused on the rights of women in Tur-
key — which are impressive. They,
after all, recently had a female prime
minister while the United States is prob-

history of the region. And the list goes
on. Fair enough. Or is it?

Noam Chomsky, the rather out-
spoken leftist critic of the American
media, has tried to argue that the great
failure of American journalism is not so
much to be found in the subjects it does
report on as in the subjects it fails to
report on. On many issues, I tend to

There is far more to Turkey than
Kurdish rebels and brutal governmen-
tal repression. It is a nation of great
complexity and depth, and its story
should be told. The writers and editors
of the Toilet Paper have attempted to
tell some of that story. What they have
attempted to tell, is in my opinion, suf-
ficiently, if not perfectly accurate. There
is a brutal conflict in Eastern Turkey.
Both sides are responsible for great

I am not ashamed of the writing
which was done on this last issue, but I
am ashamed of the writing we failed to
do.

I hope that this article will at least
encourage readers to look beyond what
is merely written and to ask what has
not been written. Whether accidentally
or purposefully, the press often fails to
present the whole story.

Honesty with ourselves

loved Diane Krause’ s performance
the other week. Clarity is not only

a wonderful name for a CD but also *

something that we all need. Clarity and

munication but without hyper-sensitiv-
ity: ;

lives with a clear perspective if we are
not honest with ourselves. Conversely,
it is nearly impossible to be honest
without clarity. Whenever I see the
word clarity, I’m reminded of the drug
advertisements with the profile of the
woman and her too perfect nose and
flawless skin placed emerging from the
blue sky and airy clouds with some
flowers right below her nose. I guess
because her sinuses are free of mucous
she has clarity. wish it were that easy
for those of us not plagued with aller-
gies.

I don’t know what is more funda-
mental — honesty with self-or honesty
with others. I suspect the relationship is
circular. We start being a little vulner-
able with ourselves; we dare to be vul-
nerable with others. Our inner-con-
nectedness grows as we allow our “true-
selves” to emerge; our
interconnectedness with others grows
because we find that we are not the only
ones struggling:

Sometimes I laugh when I con- ;

template honesty in everyday life. We
cushion what we say too often. We
wouldn’t want to offend anyone, right?
So we compromise ourselves by watch-
ing out for everyone else. It is unfortu-
nate that people have forgotten what
constructive criticismis. We need to be
able to take honest comments with a
grain of salt, learn what we can from
them, and move on.

I have imagined.a few scenarios

Other cultures are much more
straight forward. When I was in Para-
guay, my older. brother pointed at- my
zits and suggested that I use some aloe
vera from the backyard. At first that
type of conversation took me for sur-
prise; I admit I was a little offended.
After all, in the U.S. the last thing we
want to talk about is our personal falla-
cies.

. But after I decreased my sensitiv-
ity and realized that what was said had
no malicious intent, I came to value the
greater level of honesty.

This is a crucial time in our lives to
be honest with ourselves. We are mak-
ing some of the most impactful deci-
sions in our lives. Take the risk and start
being honest with yourself.

I dismayed in regard to the concept
of the Urban Plunge experience.

“basic training” for those who would

tempting to duplicate it.

I may portray myself as a cynic,
but it seems evident to me that —
generally speaking — there are at least
two reasons why someone would
choose to passively ‘‘experience” be-
ing homeless in such an event over
acting on behalf of the homeless:

1. The Urban Plunge serves to
salve the conscience of those who har-
bor some guilt about their own (i.e
their parents’) economic success. This
atonement or emotional sacrifice re-
lieves the participant from making a
donation of time, service, or ever-so-
burdensome money to an organization
that actually helps the homeless (and
nearly-homeless), such as the United

human nature that those who work
against the Establishment — or any-
thing else, for that matter — are rarely
capable of working for anything of
real value.

While it is much easier to oppose
a perceived enemy than to create a
solution to any of society’s ills, one
should be a volunteer, not a revolu-
tionary; building up is more worth-
while than tearing down.

The apparent hypocrisy of this
event disgusts me. Let us hope that
those who are truly interested in the
plight of the homeless will choose not
to make a difference rather than astate-
ment.
