The Davidson field hockey team played
back-to-back games against Radford this
week. The ’Cats competed in the first match
on Wednesday night, Oct. 11, on the rain
drenched Belk Turf Field, and played the
second game away at Radford on Saturday,
Oct. 17. Unfortunately, the Radford High-
landers defeated the ’Cats in both games 3-1
and 4-0.

In the first game of the series, Davidson
put up a tough fight, and did not allow the
Highlanders to walk away with a shutout.
Megan Lenhardt of Radford scored the first
goal of the match off a penalty corner in the
first 10 minutes; then shortly after, High-
lander, Kay Tufts, scored again, giving them
a 2-0 lead.

The ’Cats came back strong in the second
half, when Finely Amato 13 scored in the
first five minutes for her fourth goal of the
season. Unfortunately, Davidson was unable
to even the score, and Radford scored again
off a penalty comer early in the second half,
giving them a 3-1 lead. The Highlanders out-
shot the Wildcats 23-12.

For the second game of the series, the
Wildcats traveled to Radford for a weekend
match. The team hoped for a win, but again
fell short with a 4-0 loss.

Davidson started out strong with multiple
shots on goal within the first 10 minutes, but
after a wide shot by Amato, Radford’s Ma-
donna Wadolowski scored the first goal of
the match.

Radford sweeps NorPac series with Wildcats

Finley Amato ’13 battles for the bail during the Wiidcats’ 3-1 loss to Radford last
week. Amato scored her team-leading fourth goal of the season in the game.

After another series of tough play by the
*Cats, they were still unable to find the back
of the net, and Jennifer Balka of Radford
scored with ten minutes left in the half. Rad-
ford’s Melissa Register followed shortly with
a goal of her own.

Radford finished the first half with a 3-0
lead. Again Davidson played hard in the sec-

ond half, but was unable to break the Radford
shutout. The Highlanders scored again in the
final five minutes of the game to bring the
score to 4-0.

The Wildcats now stand 4-11 overall and
0-4 in the NorPac East. They will compete
at home against Appalachian State (NorPac)
at 12 p.m. on Saturday, Oct. 24.

’Cats, from page 12

the teams would exchange a total of 16 shots,
five of which were on goal. Only one mat-
tered. In the 52nd minute, just as the second
half reached full speed, Callan Elswick ’11
streaked down the sideline, eyeing crossing
opportunities in the box. She targeted in Bye-
Nagel, who redirected Elswick’s arching pass
into the back of the net.

The minutes following the go-ahead
goal witnessed 11 shots and 4 corner kicks,
but neither team could tilt the balance either
way. With their second 1-0 shutout in four
games, the ’Cats had earned a 5-3 record in
the competitive Southern Conference. That
win-loss ratio places Davidson fifth in the
SoCon standings. The ’Cats are now looking
to make the conference tournament, as four
teams qualify.

This weekend’s games against Chatta-
nooga and Samford will prove decisive in the
team’s final SoCon run. Both will take place
away from the friendly confines of Alumni
Stadium, but the ’Cats stand poised to eat
away at their small deficit and earn a trea-
sured place in November competition.
