THE DAVIDSONIAN, MARCH 18, 1926

WILDCAT BASEBALL TEAM |

(Continued from page 2) |
Any of the pitchers are also able to take |
their turn in the outer gardens when not on |
duty. Davis, Vance and Woodham are like- |
wise capable of holding down any place there, |
since all of them made their letters last year.
Then Johnson and Edwards, from last year’s |
fresh team, have also been doing fine work in |
the outfield. |
The team has an extensive schedule before |
it, arranged by Manager Bill Spencer, and |
from its beginning today until the final game |
of the season in the middle of May the team |
will be meeting tough opponents. A game |
with Dartmouth has been arranged and dur- |
ing Junior Weck, the University of North!
Carolina will be met in the annual conflict on |
the diamond between the two institutions.

ORE MUSCLES —

Vacations are often |
spoiled by soreness re- |
sulting from outdoor |
games. A good massage |
with Vicks often gives
surprising relief.

cept the work of the classroom and of the
outside activities as a duty, as his part to
play in this “little world.” The tradition of
Davidson is to honor the men who accept this
challenge.

Every student faces the problem of repre-
senting his college before the public. The
impression he makes reflects cither credit or
‘dishonor on the school. Davidson men have
belonged to both classes but tradition says
that the majority of the students have created
a favorable impression and have been the
cause of the growing popularity of the insti-
tuition. This tradition is a challenge to the
present students and should help them in their
conduct and demeanor as they realize that
they contribute greatly to the good name of
Davidson,
What am I here for?
are questions every student asks himself. The
problem of purpose in college and in life
must be solved.

Why go to college ?

College is a training school
for life and it offers the opportunity for a
man to develop those qualities which are es-
sential for success. If one can succeed in

| Fighting Wildcat Spirit, the most priceless
| tradition of Davidson, embodies the main
jessentials for success, the definite goal, the
| desire and the determination to win, fair play
jand the never say die courage. |
The traditions of Davidson, then, can and
| do help the students to solve these four great |
| problems of student life. \
