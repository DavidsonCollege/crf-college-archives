Traek Radiates Charm
In New Rubber Asphalt

A dream of more than 40
years has come true with the
completion of the new track
circling the football field.
Sterling Martin head coach of
the Track and Cross Country
team, called it ‘tone of the
best small college facilities’’
in the nation.

Martin explained the
arduous funding process that
resulted in creation of the
track. Construction was dur-

,ing the past spring and sum-
mer.

‘Three graduates who ran
for Coach .A. Heath Whittle in
the late fifties and early six-
ties got together and initiated
a fund drive for a new track
here. Dr. Angus McBride, Dr.
Bill Eckbert, and Larry
McNeal contacted everyone
who had run for Whittle in his
forty years at Davidson. The
object was to get money from
sources other . than the
normal athletic funds chan-
nels.’”’ Martin said.

He continued, ‘‘The fund
drive lasted about five years
and had gotten bogged down
after obtaining around $6,000.
Then Don Winston,

of Development, he

get the money needed to
finish the drive and build the
track.”’

The actual cost of the track
is hard to determine, Martin
said, because some of the
work was done by laborers
working on the Little Library
at the same time. The
estimated cost of the track
was “in the neighborhood’’ of
$35,000, he added.

The surface of the track is
all-weather Uni-Royal rub-
berized asphalt. It has an
asphalt base with a one-inch
thick coating of rubber mixed
with asphalt. The combina-
tion is noted for its resilience
and durability. Martin feels
that this is the ‘‘best surface
available next to, a $150,000
Tartan track.’’ The track has
a tested life of ten years.

Martin stressed the fact
that while the track is all-
weather, it is not ‘‘all-
purpose.’’

“The only’ drawback with
this track is that since it is so
‘soft’ any pressure  con-

centrated in a small area will
damage it. So no one can ride
a bike, drive a car, or use it
with football cleats,” he said.
Martin added that, ‘‘the track
is designed for running only,

OFF AND RUNNING
The new track has seen almost constant use since the start
of school. The official dedication is scheduled for Saturday. : -°.-

and everyone is welcome to
use it for that.’’ He noted that
student jogging has greatly
increased.

Martin is pleased with the
flexibility that the new track
adds to the running program.
Workouts can be conducted in
rain, and the track can ac-
commodate a full schedule of
track and field events from
the pole-vault to the steeple
chase. Its six lanes are ade-
quate for current relays plan-
ned at Davidson, he believes.

Martin hopes that the im-
proved track facilities will
aid in influencing prospective
runners to come to Davidson.
‘Since we don’t offer any
scholarships in minor sports
we should offer the best
facilities. I think. we’ve done
that here,” Martin claimed.

The drainage in the old
cinder track had been a con-
siderable problem, Martin
said. But he hopes that is a
crisis of the past.

“Director of the -Physical
Plant,Grover Meetze design-
ed a new drainage system on
the inside of the field. They
were putting in a new

utomatic sprinkling system
for the football field and so
iwe had them install the pipes
while the field was stili torn
up.

“This has really improved

: the drainage, and the only

place where we still have a

_ problem is at the far end of

the track, since the field falls
about two feet from the gym
side to the far side.’’

felt that first game jitters
might have been a factor, but
that they definitely gave
Madison a fight.

Davidson then returned
home to meet Pfeiffer College,
a team that they had just
managed to tie last year. In
the early minutes of the game,

Joe Duncan let go a blast from
about 60 feet that beat the
Pfeiffer goalie easily. David-

pressure on, but couldn’t score
until mid-way through the fir-

a head-in on a center from the
rightwing,

At this point, Pfeiffer’s
defeat was evident. The Cats
continued their relentless at-
tack with Tom Blackwood and
Duncan connecting on long
shots. Davidson finished off its
first half scoring when Bob

that the goalie had blocked.
By the time the buzzer soun-
ded, the score was Davidson 5
- Pfeiffer 0.,

Just how totally Davidson
dominated Pfeiffer was
evidenced by.the fact that the
visitors managed to get into
Cat territory only a half dozen
times, and could never mount
a serious attack.

In the second half, Coach
Chip Stone. benched all of his’
starters and the result was
three Pfeiffer goals. ‘

to scoring against our star-

scored by the slick ball-
