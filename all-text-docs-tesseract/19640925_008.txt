“WE FINALLY GOT THE NOTEBOOK, GRIER!”
Dr. Chalmers Davidson Shows Wilson’s Journal To Pres. Martin (left).

College Buys Journal
Kept By Wilson Here

A notebook which was kept by Woodrow Wilson when he was a Davidson stud-

ent has been purchased by the colle

ge for $3,500 from Stanley Horne of Nashville,

Tenn., who reportedly discovered the notebook in a second-hand book store.

President D. Grier Martin
and Director of the Library
Chalmers G. Davidson arranged
for the $3,500 acquisition with
the assistance of Dr. Arthur S.
Link. a noted Wilson scholar
of the Princeton University fac-
ulty and father of a Davidson
freshman.

“We have known of the exist-
ence of the notebook in the li-
brary of Mr. Horne for a good
many years,” said Dr. David-
son, ‘and naturally felt that
since Wilson kept the notebook
while at Davidson that it be-
longed in the college's Rare
Book Room.

‘We were somewhat concern-
ed when we learned of Prince-
ton’s interest in acquiring the
notebook. but gaihed. with Dr.
Link's help, the right of first re-
fusal if Mr. Horne would name a
price.”

Horne, editor of the Southern
‘Lumberman, agreed to sell it.
The Richardson Foundation of
Greensboro and New York, con-
stant benefactors of the college,
aware of what the notebook

would mean to the Davidson Li-.

brary, provided half of the $3,-
500 purchase price.

Wilson was known as Thomas
W. Wilson at Davidson. He play-
ed second: base on the freshman
baseball team of the 1873-74
school year. He spent hours
practicing his handwriting, had
a keen interest in British mili-
tary history (locating a possible
relative, Lord T. W. Wilson,
Duke of Arlington, Commander
of the Royal Lancers Guard in
1799). He was careful in con-
jugating his Greek verbs, follow-
ing the prayers from the “South-
ern Presbyterian,” and keeping
track of his laundry.

Yet he was as carefree as the
next man in scribbling or dood-
ling on an unnecessary page.

Wilson came to Davidson
while his father was teaching in
Columbia Seminary in the year
1873. Repeatedly stating that
he wished to continue his edu-
cation nearer to where history
‘was being made. he enrolled in
Princeton a year later, remain-
ing out of school for an interim
period of one year.

on the Davidsom campus over

a part of the Davidson legend.

One of the most often told is
of Wilson’s return to Davidson
after he became President. He
desired to see his room in old
Chambers Building: his aide
knocked on the door and told
the student inside ‘“This is Wood-
row Wilson, President of the
United States.”

The student inside, anticipat-
ing a joke being played by a
fellow student replied, ‘Well,
this is the Queen of Sheba —
grease yourself and slide under
the door." And when the Pres-
ident turned the knob and walk-
ed in, the student is reported
to have jumped out the win-
dow.

True or false, Wilson did Jat-
er write’ of his dormitory life
at Davidson, stating that each
student was responsible for sup-
plying wood for his dormitory
room fireplace and that some
well-off students hired it. done,
but since he was not one of these
he took care of this chore him-
self.

The Wilson Notebook. photo-
copies of which have been re-

. quested by Princeton, will be

placed in the Davidson Library
Smith Rare Book Room. Other
items there in the Wilson col-
lection are several letters from

President Wilson to members of
the Davidson faculty, as well as
first editions of all Wilson's
published works.

Wind Ensemble Plans
Sunday Lawn Concert

The Davidson College Wind
Ensemble will present its first
concert of the season on Sunday,
Sept. 27. The open-air perform-
ance will begin at 4:30 p. m. in
front of the Cunningham Fine
Arts Center.

The 36-member ensemble, un-
der the direction of Dr. Grier
M. Williams, will play selec-
tions ranging from classical
opera to children’s nursery
songs. The concert, scheduled
to last 45 minutes, will feature
four marches: ‘‘Father of Vic
tory."  ‘‘Billboard = March.”
“Chimes of Liberty,” and Hand-
el’s “Slow March" from Scipio.
The major classical work will
be Ravel's ‘Pavan for a Dead
Princess."

Following this, a medley of
Jerome Kern's songs, plus ‘““Am-
erican Patrol’’ and ‘‘Anparito
Roca,” wili represent the other
end of the musical spectrum.
Also included will be ‘Pop
Goes the Weasel,’ a special
number “just for the kids.”

The concert will mark the de-
but of 12 freshmen. Chosen as
a result of the Orientation Week
try-outs, they will constitute
one-third of the orchestra. Part
of the reason for such a large
number of newcomers is the
loss of several transfer students
and five students living abroad

New Group Will Show
‘Intellectual’ Flicks

A new organization called the
“Film Friends of Davidson"
has been created by the Union
Film Committee to further inter-
est in movies of high intellectual
content.

Film Committee Chairman

Gordon Ball has announced that
in the course of the current
semester five films will be
shown in Hodson Hall on sep-
arate Wednesday nights at 8:00
p.m. A short subject will be
charged for single admission,
but subscriptions of ¢wo dollars
to cover admission to the set of
five movies will also be offer-
ed.

Announcements” giving the
full details should arrive in fac-
ulty members’ and students’
mailboxes by next week, Ball
said. People in Charlotte and at
Queens college will also be. in-
vited to participate.

On Oct. 7, ‘La Strada’ will
be shown. This movie, by Ital-
ian Director Frederico Fellini,
won the Academy Award as the
best foreign film of 1956 and the
Grand Prize at the Venice In-
ternational Film Festival.

“Throne of Blood,’ a Japan-
ese picture whose story source
is Shakespeare's Macbeth, will
be shown on Oct. 28.

“Breathless,” the highly prais-
ed and highly experimental film
by Jean-Luc Godard, will appear
on Nov. 18, and ‘Bed and So-
fa," an early Russian silent-
screen classic, will follow it on
Dec. 9.

The final film of the lot will
be ‘The Savage Eye.” It is Am-
erican, and it is described as a
“half-documentary, _half-fant-
asy (which) fuses extraordinary
images of the real world — the
seamier side of life in Los Ange-
les — with the philosophical al-
legories of a young divorcee.”

“We believe there is a certain
element at Davidson which will
appreciate this, which has been
waiting for this, and that there
are those who will find it more
than they expected."’ Ball said
concerning the enterprise.

this year.

-Dr. Williams commented that
this Freshman Class was ‘‘one
of the best groups of instrument-
alists in recent years.” As an
example of this confidence the
ensemble will be performing af-
ter only two rehearsals.

Dr. Williams encourages the
student body, as well as the gen-
eral public, to attend all the
lawn concerts given this autumn
and next. spring.

Rush Week Brings

ew Infringements

The Davidson Interfraternity Council’s Rush Week
‘| brought 73% of the freshmen into the Greek system on

the first day of pledging, saw five infringements made

of the regulations governin

it, and applied a “note

moratorium” in the middle of its five-day existence.

The 73% figure — not the
largest in Davidson's history
—conceals the fact that the 203

‘| freshmen it represents consti-

tute the largest pledge group
ever inducted on the campus.
Rick Von Unwerth, president of
the IFC, pointed out that the
class of ‘68 is one of the largest
ever to undergo rush, due to
the spaces made available by
the 23 juniors now in Europe.

Five violations were made of
the IFC's regutations, and each
violator paid the standard $50
fine stipulated in the same set
of regulations. Von Unwerth
did not elaborate on the partic-
ular persons, fraternities or vio-
lations involved.

It has been past practice dur-
ing Rush Week for a fraternity
member to leave a note if he
found a freshman not in his
room during dormitory .rush.
This year, Von Unwerth felt

compelled to call a halt to the

custom soon after Rush Week
had begun.

“The privilege was abused,”
he said. ‘‘The courtesy was no
longer a courtesy. It turned into
a contest to see how many
notes could be plied on a guy’s
desk. Considerable bad blood
was stirred up among the fra-

ternities.”

The chart system, devised by
Dave Olin of the class of °64,
worked smoothly in its second
year. A large schedule card was
drawn up for each freshman
and put on the wall in Chambers
basement.

Freshmen who were unsure
of the procedures involved were
given a briefing at 9:30 Sunday
night in Hodson Hall.

Von Unwerth credited IPC
Rush Chairman Rock Walker
and Vice-president Fred Sackett
for the efficiency and smooth
ness with which they handled
Rush Week. “They did an ex-
cellent job. All the credit be
longs to them.”

‘Van Doren Will Appear

lumbia University for 40 years,
he retired with his wife Doro-
thy to a farm in Cornwall, Con-
necticut. Collected Poems

ren was a motion picture critic
