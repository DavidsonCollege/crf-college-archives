Term limits and campaign
reform undergo setbacks

A key measure of the Republi-
can “Contract with America” that
also had wide public support did
not get past the House last week as
the constitutional amendment to
impose term limits lost on a ot
211 vote.

The vote needed 69 more sup-
porters to get the 2/3 majority re-
quired for Constitutional amend-
ments. The amendment was to pre-
vent anyone from serving more than
12 years in the House or the Senate,
although someone could serve 24
years in both chambers.

Representative Bill McCollum
(R-Fl.) said that the limits were
needed because too much power
was vested in the hands of the few,

most members got re-elected ahd
“careerism does affect too many
congresspeople.”

Representative John Dingell
(D.-Mich.) was against the proposal
saying, “Our existing system of term
limits works splendidly - itis called
elections.”

He cites the loss of Democratic
control of Congress and the fact that
54% of current House members
were elected after 1992 as evidence
for why the limits are unnecessary.

Term limits have been passed
as laws in various states, but courts
have struck down their efficacy at
the federal level. Many decided on
an electoral basis in which states
that did not have term limits would

~be at an advantage to those who did
have them because the former state’s
representatives could serve longer
and dominate key leadership posi-
tions on the basis of solidarity. A
Constitutional amendment would
be needed for any such term limits
on the U.S. House or Senate.

The Constitution does limit the
President to two terms.

Supporters do state that impos-
ing term limits would put Congress
back in touch with the people. But,
opponents indicate that many great
statesmen could be denied the op-
portunity to let their experience and
talent lead the nation.

Campaign finance reform suffers

Another reform-oriented plan
that will change the way elections
are run in this country is facing
trouble. Campaign finance reform
now faces the trouble of being for-
gotten or mired in the law making
process.

President Clinton pledged in
his 1993 Inaugural address to give
the people back their government
through substantive reform initia-
tives, but since then no laws or
reform changes have been an-
nounced.

The President supports the
McCain-Feingold bill which would
ban all soft money donations to
political parties and would seriously
restrict much Public Action Com-
mittee operations. However, that
bill has between 20-30 supporters

in the Senate. John McCain is an
Arizona Republican and Russ
Feingold is a Wisconsin Democrat.

The problem is that it will be
hard to get any kind of consensus on
campaign finance reform. Demo-
crats want more publicly funded
elections, mandated by law or Con-
stitutional amendment. They believe
that government will be account-
able only to the people and no one
else.

Republicans are not willing to
support any such initiative. They
want stricter regulation and more
public knowledge of the way fund
raising is done now. They also be-
lieve that term limits will help push
the public’s voice more than cam-
paign finance reform will.

Still, the McCain-Feingold bill

remains publicly popular and its
supporters insist public pressure will
be the best chance it has to get
passed. Common Cause is trying to
gather 1,776,000 petition signatures
that will support the bill. Soon, com-
mercials are planned to enhance the
message further and to highlight to
the public which of their represen-
tatives do or do not support the bill.

Meanwhile, both parties con-
tinue to hold million dollar fund
raisers and take in large contribu-
tions. Both say that it would be
strategically wrong to stop taking in
money and risking loosing elec-
tions in 1998. Clearly, the law will
have to be passed before any changes
take place.

Clinton and Netanyahu meet
President Clinton and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
talked in Washington as the President praised Netanyahu’s perfor-
mance in office and urged him to begin talks with Syria. He also stressed
that he believes Netanyahu will continue to press the peace process
begun by his predecessors. Netanyahu indicated that he will consider
many of the President’s requests but that he wants to see demands and
concessions from Syria also.

European Union decides to wait on challenging Cuba policy

The State department said it was “disappointed” that the European
Union did not completely issue a legal challenge against U.S.-Cuba
policy specifically due to the Helms-Burton act that is designed to
discourage foreign investment in the country.

Clinton orders negotiation between pilots and American

Using executive power to avert a strike, President Clinton ordered that
the two feuding parties in the American Airlines labor dispute allow a
federal group to come up with a non-binding plan for the two sides to
agree. The action prevented some 240,000 travellers that use American
each day from having to cancel or reroute their plans.

Dow Jones soars into record territory

The Dow Jones industrial index climbed into record territory as it ended
the week at 7022.24. The amazing performance has surprised even the
most optimistic economists. Most of the financial world sees it as the
result of investors’ strong belief in the value of stocks. Inflation or arise
in the principal interest do not look to be arriving so most stock watchers
| expect the growth to continue.

From President Clinton’s State of the Union address last week:
“Let’s work together to meet these. goals: Every eight-year-old
must be able to read, every 12-year-old must be able to log on to the
Internet, every 18-year-old must be able to go to college, and every adult
American must be able to keep on learning for a lifetime.”

And every President of the United States must be able to count to
