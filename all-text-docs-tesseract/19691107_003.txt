Spencer’s Commissions Report

The long-awaited Spencer
Commission reports make
their public appearance this
week in THE DAVIDSON-

They will be published
soon in their complete form.

Research and Study

The commission held thir-
teen meetings between De-
cember 9, 1968 and May 30,
1969. At.its first meeting the
commission set as its pri-
mary geal an attempt to
answer the three questions
posed by President Spencer
‘in his inaugural-address:

(1) What are legiti-
mate objectives o inter-
collegiate athletic program?
(2) What should be reason-
ably spent to achieve those
Objectives?

(3) How can we achieve
those objectives without
moral or educational com-
promise?

To prepare itself to answer
these three questions the
commission:

(1) Studied the financial
statement for physical edu-
cation. and athletics, broken
down by individual sports,
including scholarships.

(2) ‘Reviewed the follow-
ing earlier documents deal-
ing with athletics:

(a) The report of the Hug-
er S. King subcommittee of
the Board of Trustees (b)
The College's self-study re-
port and the comment of the
Southern Association's Visit-
ing (Committee (c) The re-
port of the subcommittee on
student life of the Blue Sky
Committee.

(3) Solicited written re-
commendations from the Di-
rector of Athletics, all
eoaches, and the Director of
Admissions on several ma-
jor questions of athletic po-
licy, and supplemented the
written statements with in-
terviews with all of these
people (except that the
basketball coaches were not
available for any of the com-
mission meetings.)

(4) Sent questionnaires to
all students and _ faculty
members. and to about ten
per cent of the alumni, in
an attempt to learn their
preferences about questions
of athletic policy.

(§) Held-an- open meeting
at which sutdents and fac-
ulty were invited to express
their opinions on athletic po-
licy. :

Findings

Almost without exception,
there is strong agreement
in an intercollegiate athletic
program. The advantages of
such “A program are that it,
provides competition for
good athletes, develops an
esprit de corps in the stu-
dent body, holds and
strengthens the loyalties of
the alumni, and where the

new avenue for publicizing

torial staff with extreme

the report. will remain in-
tact.

If any, minor gaps appear,
the publication of the entire
reports in the near future
will remedy the situation.

The five commissions
worked throughout the 1968-
69 school year and, in some
into the, summer in
order to offer guidelines for
the course that Davidson is
to take in the coming de
cade,

nominations of trustees, fac-

group receiving equal status,

In his inaugural ‘address
Spencer listed the five prin-
cipal areas which Davidson
needed most to study, and
called for the commissions
to exhaust their time and
energies to investigate those

areas.

If these advantages are to
be realized, the teams should

games. Moral victories or

There is much less support
for subsidization of our foot-

a much larger dollar afd

Extra-Campus Responsibilities

We see the responsibility
of this Commission to be to
delineate Davidson's role in
confronting more directly
the Southeast, a region
which has, in the words of
D¥. Spencer, “been plagued
for a century by problems
of racial discrimination, eco-
nomic deprivation, and cul-
tural malutrition.”

Beyond question, Davidson
has functioned much as a
“sheltered workshop” in the
midst of these problems
characteristic of our region.
For the sake of Davidson, its
students and faculty, — its
community, «and the South
east this Commission feels
that we must move more di
rectly into the society in
which we exist, and which
we seek'to serve.

expanded involvement in
three areas: (1) Education
for the Disadvantaged, (2)
Continuing Education and
(3) more relevant and real-
istic relations with our local
community.

Education for the

The first and major thrust
in our campaign to serve the
southeast region should be
an attempt to realign our
student body in such a way
as to be a more realistic
reflection of the composition
of our society.

We feel that Davidson is
now a school of white, Pro-

This commission feels that
one or two individuals a year
is not enough. The college
has always denied charges
of tokenism and yet has
never had more than six
black students in a student
body of one thousand. We
feel that a goal of at ‘east
a hundred black students is
a realistic number for this
student body.

In the course of its delib-
erations, the Commission has
not been able to locate and
describe any compelling rea-
son for Davidson’s remain-
ing an all men’s college.
Frequently it has heard that
American education needs to
offer alternatives, and a
single-sex college is indeed
an alternative to the over-
whelming majority of coedu-
cational colleges. However,
why Davidson should offer
such an alternative is uncer-
tain, unless one argues that
because it always has, it
should continue to do so. . .

With régard to the
