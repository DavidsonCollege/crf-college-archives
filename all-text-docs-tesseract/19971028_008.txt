Arguments for sororities are not convincing

ious articles opposing sororities in
. the last two Davidsonians. Finally,
atleast
four of the
many like-
minded
people |
with
whom I
have come
into contact are speaking their side of
the debate on sororities at Davidson.

I still, however, feel compelled to
chime in with my objections to the
proposed institution of sororities here.
It is only if individuals who are of a
particular opinion make their presence
and number known that the point can be
made.

The previous articles have made
excellent points and stated very clearly
what has been on the minds of a number
of women on campus. I simply have a
few more things which] have not heard
mentioned. For instance, I desperately
wish that people like Buster Burk would
stop saying that sororities. provide a
“tighter community among women”
than do eating houses.

I realize that two of the three eat-
ing houses are very large. But as many
of you may know, the third currently
has only 60 members. And I guarantee
you that it is a tightly-knit community.

[== been so relieved to see var-

Even with 30 more members, I
believe it would be as close as it is now.
Even the larger houses seem reluctant
to split up, which indi-
cates to me that they are
at least in some signifi-
cant way bonded, or con-
sider themselves a com-
munity.

Dowe have to have
secret handshakes and
other “secret rituals,” as Burk says, to
be truly close? In Connor, we do not
have a secret handshake, nor is any-
thing about our house particularly se-
cret, but we have plenty of tradition.

We have a chant, we have a dance
that we do to “I Will Survive” (when-
ever and wherever it is played), and
only we strip to our bras (our real bras)
and streak the Court at self-selection,
I’m proud to say. I’m sure Rusk and
Warner have their own traditions, too.

Furthermore, I find the entire
equality argument ridiculous. When a
section of the flier on sororities boasts
that, “In combining the eating houses
and sororities, the women have an
equivalent experience to the men’s for
the same amount of money. . . Equal-
ity!”

I thought I would vomit.

If gender equality on this campus
requires sororities, then I...well, I’m
speechless.

Equality is not the issue. If we -

were trying to establish equality with
the men’s social organizations, we’d
have five eating houses and five frater-
nities on the Court. As far as I’m
concerned, women have a superior es-
tablishment in the eating houses to the
men’s fraternities. .

Self-selection, contrary to one fac-
ulty member’s article, is nota “joke” —
for the eating houses, that is.

In the eating house system, self-
selection is just what it says it is., We
don’t subject ourselves or each other to
the intense social pressure of rushing a

have to buy dresses, we don’t have to
campaign, we don’t have.to subject
ourselves to the whims (however harm-
less) of members.

Sororities simply cannot offer that.
They can within the first few years —
while they are new, small, and unat-
tached. But the introduction of the
system of sororities will eventually
change the face of the women’s social
scene, and it will be a change toward the

_ exclusivity and superficiality often seen,
and remarked upon, within the current
fraternity system. ,

option in direct opposition to the existing system of self-

selection.”

particular house, which not only re-
quires an undue amount of time (attend-
ing the preferred house’s functions and
generally getting in good with mem-
bers), but also the subjection of pledg-
ing or humiliation or rejection.

There can be nothing more uplift-
ing to a freshwoman than the selection
of the house of her choice, whereupon
herselection she is welcomed and fussed
over as a desired new sister. We don’t

“import” sororities from other schools .

for parties or other functions, or visit
them at other schools. This is damaging
enough to dating and gender relations,
which some lament quite vocally, at
Davidson. Imagine what would happen
if we had sororities here: Greeks con-
sort with Greeks, girls go where guys
are, and eating houses are dead.

My final concern is the effect of
sororities on women who have not yet

decided to come to Davidson, those
women still flipping through the
Princeton Review’s Top 310 Colleges.

I, and many women I know, have
explicitly stated that the eating house
system at Davidson was one of the
deciding factors in our decision to ap-
ply or attend.

I would have, as might others, kept
flipping through that catalog if I’d seen
sororities listed in the sidebar. I didn’t
want to chance a school where I might
have had to put up with the self-degra-
dation of rushing a sorority.

Weare told that sororities at David-
son will not be like that. But prospec-
tive students.don’t know that. The
Princeton Review is not going to list
“pseudo-sorority” as a social option for
women. If these women are anything
like me in the early stages of my college
search, they’ Il keep flipping, too. What
about the Class of 2001? Aren’t we
cheating them out of what they were led
to expect from Davidson?

Sororities are not simply another
option. They are an option in direct
Opposition to the existing system of
self-selection. Those of us who value
and support the existing system have an
equal right to preserve it, even at the
cost of the minority right.

Ican’t wait to see the SGA’s count
of exactly how many-women do want
sororities.

deep-reaching conspiracy. Each of my

professors had made some hint about

the unlikeliness of snow and the lack of

one of the
most insidious plots ever perpetrated
against college students anywhere. Flu
shots were given Wednesday on Cham-
bers lawn, supposedly available to the
entire campus.

deep in my mind. Ev-

lull me into a false sense
of security about the warmth and health
of the environment: Small seeds of
doubt about the flu shot were being
cultivated. I was healthy. It was warm.
Why.would I wanta flu shot? It was just
so much bother that could be avoided.

Concerning the posters used to

empire.

Maybe the building that is going
on in front of Dana is not really a
companion biology building. If you
squint just right at those girders you
can start to see a hanger for a bizarre
alien space dish. I’ve spoken to the
workers at the building and was as-
sured that no such thing was in the
works, but I could have sworn that
their pupils were vertical and they
blinked from the sides of their eye
sockets. The puzzled glances I got
were most likely were the symbol on
their planet for fear of one who has
guessed close to the truth.

There was even a clue in our very
own Davidsonian that the aliens were
hatching a plot. The front-page pic-

they had told him there were no more
flu shots given as of about 3:15 p.m.
My first thought was not about myself
and the fact that I had not yet gotten
one; instead, I thought first about the
greater college community and real-
ized the dastardly plot afoot.

Through an apparently innocent
misjudgement on the amount of vac-
cine necessary, the College, acting in
conjunction with secret government
departments, was trying.to kill off the
entire procrastinating segment of its
student population, myself among
them.

By the time I found out about the
“shortage,” it was too late to stop them.

members of their alien ally than to come

That little alien popping up in front

behind the whole plan. And these were
not just simple posters. They were

question is whether they have been

With all of this evidence, don’tbe
surprised when the flu virus canisters
arrive from out of a blue sky. The
aliens are coming, and they need pro-
crastinators gone before they arrive.
I’m not sure why. Maybe their planet
is always on time and can’t bear to see
time wasted. If there are flu shots
anytime in the near future, get them.

Experiential learning

avidson College has a sustained
D commitment to academic ex-

cellence that permeates the col-
lege community. We are here to learn;
as students, we experience the enormity
of that commitment daily.

That needed to be said, because I
cannot make it clear
enough that I do not
take issue with the
rigor of this institu-

dents.

As a school, we need to broaden
our commitment to experiential educa-
tion. Let me define what this word
means to me. Experiential learning
bridges the gap between academia and
the rest of the world. It puts knowledge
into action. Teach-
ing, whether. it’s
one to one or one to
200, is experiential:

tion. I ama

large part because of

the quality of thought that we demand
from each other. However, one thing
about the way we teach and learn has
begun to trouble me: meaning. How
does this knowledge, which we are all
so busy gathering, fit into the broader
context of our lives?

On the surface, the answer is prob-
ably obvious for most professors —
knowledge is your work. But if you dig
beyond that or go back to your own time
as a student when the world was an
unfolding expanse of possibility, the
answer probably becomes more nebu-
lous.

Thirteen years ago, when Dr. John
Kuykendall took the reins as president
of this institution, he spoke of two words
which he hoped Davidson students
would embody: scholarship and
servanthood. Earlier this month when
we gathered to celebrate the inaugura-
tion of our new president, I heard a
startling echo to what Dr. Kuykendall
had said all those years ago.

President Vagt’s image of the
Davidson student was not limited to
work done in the classroom but broad-
ened to include work done in the world.
The thing that sets Davidson people
apart from others is not simply the qual-
ity of our minds, but the quality of our
commitment to the people around us. If
you open the Red Book and leaf through
the beginning pages, you will find this
sentiment echoed in the Statement of
Purpose. We are not simply here to
collect knowledge, ‘but rather to be-
come useful people with the ability and
desire to apply our knowledge in the
world.

That rhetoric is another reason I
came to Davidson. But after two years,
I look around and I am saddened to see
that this institution is not doing all that

that’s one of the

reasons it was prob-

ably easier for the

teachers to answer my earlier question,

but experiential learning doesn’t stop
there.

Internships in a field where a stu-

- dent has some background — translat-

ing and distributing information on
healthcare options to people who other-
wise would never receive the informa-
tion, working inaclinic, traveling across
Europe taking photographs and writing
stories, doing an oral history project,
working in groups to solve problems
that any individual in the group would
have great difficulty solving alone, liv-
ing homeless on the streets for 48 hours
— all these things and many more fall
under the umbrella of experiential edu-
cation for me, and we are not doing
enough of them.

While I do not contend that ex-
periential education alone will immedi-
ately transform Davidson to a place
which creates the type of citizens of
which we so often speak, I do believe it
will push us towards that metamorpho-
sis. In addition, there would also be
some amazing side effects.

More experiential learning would
solidify bonds between students, fac-
ulty, and the community, and it would
bea time. But, in all honesty, my

ion doesn’t count for much when
I’m one voice crying out alone. I need
to know what you think.

Right now I’m trying to gather an
interested group of people to discuss
the issue and see how experiential edu-
cation fits in at Davidson. I hope this
group will include students, faculty,
and staff, so I urge anyone with an
opinion to be involved in the discus-
sion.

cerns, or you just want to talk, then call
me or e-mail me (x6573, v.m. 3826,
