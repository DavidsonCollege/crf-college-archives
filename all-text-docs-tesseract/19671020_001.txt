forojan students studying

lo continue the practice in

“We are obrcentiy dia. tbe

nancial doubtoes for the pre

John Kelton, faentty advis.

hoping for several years that
the foundation wauld continue

withdrawing support once the
program had developed.

The program was estab-

lished at Davidaon in 1958 by
the Richard Foundation and

- QOver Blue Sky Delay

Letter Endorses

1968 Deadline

A letter expressing ‘concern over the delay in the
implementation of the Blue Sky curriculum” was
drawn up by Student Council members today and
presented to Frontis W. Johnston, chairman of the
Blue Sky Committee, and President D, Grier Martin,
thairman of the College Finance Committee.

The letter emphasized that “this program is vital
fo maintaining Davidson's leadership among the na-
tion's liberal arts colleges” and urged that “every ef-
jori be made to meet the deadline” for implementa-
tion officially set for next fall,

Action by the Student Council was prompted by
the Board of Trustees’ decision to postpone, at least
tentatively, implementation of the new curriculum.
