Mr. Faulkner pays a visit to Davidson

By MARK CHEN

On the night of Dec. 4, the
novelist William Faulkner paid a
visit to Love Auditorium.

His showcase was the one-
man play Oh, Mr. Faulkner, Do
You Write?, written and_per-
formed by John Maxwell. Max-
well has already performed this
play around the country to critical
praise.

In an intense two hours of per-
formance, broken by only one in-
termission, he delighted the audi-
ence with anecdotes and public
sayings of this Southern writer.
Maxwell describes his own mis-
sion as “spreading the word,” the
words of Faulkner as he spoke and
wrote them throughout his literary
career.

In that respect, the show was a

complete success. The evening
began with Faulkner sitting at the
_ typewriter in his hometown of Ox-
ford, Mississippi. He had just won
the Nobel Prize for: Literature in

The winter term customarily
provides plenty of free time for the
Davidson student. The Light Fac-
tory at the Spirit Square Arts Cen-
ter in Charlotte supplies a cultural
compliment to balance the Patter-
son Court festivities. The current
exhibition, “A Comparative. Por-
trait of Appalachia: Photographs
_by Shelby Lee Adams and Doris
Ulmann,” is being shown through
Dec. 30. This show.is unique in
that it treats the same subject por-
_trayed through the same medium
to achieve dichotomous effects’
Upon entering the exhibit one

is cofronted with a room devoted

‘soley to the works of Doris Ul-
mann. These photographs were

taken in the late 20's and the early
30°s by a well-educated and aris-
tocratic woman. Ulmann worked

with the uneducated and poorest

white people in the Deep South.
Her subject was therefore com-
pletely separate from her personal
background.
- Ulmann admired the native
and pious intelligence of these
.. Appalachian people whom she re-
ferred to as * ‘genuine.’ * This at-
titude shaped her approach to her
| subject. Her photographs are
taken in soft focus, are posed and
depict the hard-working and hon-
est side of the Appalachian

people. In this way Ulmann dig-

nifies, almost romanticizes, her
subject.

The photograph _ entitled
“Woman With Infant” could be
viewed as a rendition of the
Madonna and Child portrait. The
woman is young, innocently dres-
sed in white, and casts a humble

' glance at the camera. She cradles
her healthy child in her lap, clasp-

ing the tiny infant’s hands. The

ing the reporters and other gaw-
kers who were besieging his
‘home. At first telling the audience
to go away, Faulkner finally re-
lented and granted an interview.

What followed was a rambling
conversation touching on his own
life, his views on race, other
American writers, and the final
meaning of literature. The talk
veered quickly between the hilari-
ous and the tragic, two qualities:
which were always - present. in
Faulkner’s life.

The hilarious .came out soon
enough, Whatever his. place in
American literature, Faulkner was
no distant and cold-blooded icon:
He recounted without remorse the
legendary Faulkner cussedness.
While working in a post office,
Faulkner loved to read the
magazines, but could not because
of the customers. His solution was
simple enough — refuse to see
any of them and throw away their

selves to their task. One would de-
duce that this has been a family ac-
tivity for generations, and will
continue uninterrupted infinitely

_ into the future.

“Craftsmen Outside Barn”
(pictured) clearly depicts. UI-
mann’s conception of the dig-
_nified Appalachian laborer. The

The visitor then enters the sec-
ond room of the exhibit which dis-
plays the work of Shelby Lee
Adams. Adams is currently an in-
structor of photography at Salem
‘State College. His photographs of
the Appalachian people are con-
temporary. Adams claims that his
photographs represent primarily
an autobiographical search since
his own roots are in Eastern Ken-
tucky. His heritage has provided
him with access to the intimate
and clandestine lives of the AP
palachian people. Shelby aspires
to penetrate the superficial masks
which cover the true underlying
individual: He does this through
his stark and realistic unposed
photographs which portray the
Appachian people vividly in their
impoverished environment.

The first photograph, “Jacob
and His Mother,” shows im-
mediately the contrast in approach
by Adams in comparison to UI-
‘mann, Shelby’s portrait is execu-
ted in sharp focus with strong
lighting in contrast to Ulmann’s
use of soft focus. Shelby’s tech-

mail.

The title of this play comes
from another example. While ona
hunting trip with the director
Howard Hawks and the actor
Clark Gable, Gable asked him

_ what were the best books in Amer-

ican literature to read. Faulkner
listed some books, and gave his
own. Surprised, Gable asked,
“Oh, Mr. Faulkner, do you
“write?” To° which Faulkner re+
sponded, “Yes I do, Mr. Gable.
What do you do?”

But there is another side to
Faulkner, one which also came
out that evening. It was that of a
man always dreamy with the
tragedies of life. Many critics start
their analysis of Faulkner’s writ-
ings by seeking the hidden social
commentary. But for. Faulkner,
the first priority was to depict the
larger-than-life men and women
stalking his imagination. For him,
the problem of race was not politi-
cal or economic, but on the gran-

der scale of human tragedy.

Faulkner said that he
proved on God’s creation in his
novels, “For God:has no sense of
the dramatic.” He : purposely
exaggerated and departed from
the bare facts of reality. They did
not fit his ideas on the granduer of
man. And ‘it was that dignity

which Faulkner believed in all his .

life. He manifested that belief-in
all his novels, as well as in-his

-. Nobel Prize acceptance speech. In
that address, Faulkner affirmed -

that man “would not only endure,
but prevail.”

The task of showing these ex-
tremes and contradictions in a
one-man show is difficult. Fortu-
nately, Maxwell succeeded in a
bravura _ performance. —_He

switched at a dizzying speed be-

tween laughter and grief with
hardly a misstep. He portrayed
each aspect of Faulkner with both
love and understanding. He also
succeeded in bringing the audi-

im-

if\

ence to a closer appreciation of
Faulkner. The set was made up of
replicas and of actual objects from
Faulkner’s study in Oxford.

Maxwell went into the audi-
ence. and offered gingersnaps,
keeping up the illusion of an inter-
view in his Home. Perhaps the best
measure of the play’s success was
how much he enjoyed performing
it, coming out for his bows with a
radiant smile. a audience mir-
rored his ae

_ nique highlights the imperfect hu-
loving mother and child relation-

mansty, of his subject. Like UI-
mann’s “Woman and Infant,”
“Jacob and His Mother” (pic-
tured) shows a mother holding her
child. However, Shelby’s portrait
is a distortion! of the traditional
Madonna and Child motif. The
woman’s face is.Jined-and angu-
lar, and her. lips “are: pursed to

ing to forget the unhappy ¢hild on

eyes are teary and bloodshot. The
overall effect of this photograph is
indeed unsettling. ©

A. second photograph, “103-
Year Old Woman and Her Fam-
ily, portrays an extended family
living in the same small, delapi-
dated home. The grandmother is
sprawled on the dirty blanket cov-
ering the bed. She wears a tattered
dress and no shoes. Her expres-
sion is oné of hopeless apathy.
She is surrounded by her equally
abject family members. Two
members of the family are grotes-
-quely overweight; the third sits in
gaunt juxtaposition. Whereas UI-
mann portrays a similar generat-
ional.gepresentation’in her peace-
ful and comforting “Three Gener-
ations of Basket Weavers,” this
photograph displays an absence of
unity and an overwhelming sense
of despondancy.

A. final portrait, “Corrinne’s
Babies on Christmas Day,” espe-
cially demonstrates the indigent
condition of Appalachia. Two
young boys are sitting on the top
of an antiquated, rusty deep
freezer beside their only Christ-
mas present, a hand-me-down
Tonka truck. Both boys are un-
kempt and filthy. This state paral-
-lels their environment,
