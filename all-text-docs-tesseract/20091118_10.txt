Red Foxes edge Wildcats 14-6 in season finale

Ray Francis
Staff Writer

The Marist Red Foxes ground out 276
rushing yards on Saturday, spoiling David-
son’s Senior Day and coming away with a
14-6 victory.

Ben Behrendt ’11 produced Davidson’s
only points of the game on field goals of 37
and 30 yards. The Wildcats were held to 49
yards rushing and 144 yards of total offense.

The Wildcat defense established some
momentum in the game’s opening quarter,
as Patrick Hunt ’12 intercepted a Chris De-
bowski pass and returned it to the Wildcat 34
with five minutes gone in the game.

Taking advantage of the good field posi-
tion, Matt Heavner ’12 connected with An-
drew Aldrich ’10 for a 24 yard gain that set
up Behrendt’s 37-yarder that gave the Wild-
cats a 3-0 advantage with six minutes to play
in the opening frame.

Unwilling to go quietly, the Red Foxes
responded with a brutal 14-play drive that
covered 67 yards and took eight minutes off
the clock. The drive, which consisted entirely
of rushing plays, was capped by Ryan Din-
nebeil’s three-yard plunge into the end zone
with 13 minutes to play in the first half.

Michael Blanchard ’11 led the Wildcats
down the field in response, rushing for third-
down conversions twice in a drive that would
eventually reach the Marist 5. After losses
of three and four yards on second and third
downs, however, Davidson had to settle for
Behrendt’s second field goal of the half.

Marist tried to answer before halftime,
driving to the Wildcat 19 with under a minute
to play. The drive was snuffed out by Tyler
Lemons °10, who intercepted Debowski at
the Davidson 11 and enabled the Wildcats to
go into the intermission down only 7-6.

The Red Foxes were the first side to
mount an effective drive in the second half,
driving to the Wildcat 15 and lining up for
a 32-yard field goal attempt. The Davidson
special teams unit asserted itself, however,
as Ellis Martin ’12 broke through the Marist
protection and blocked Jason Myers’ field
goal attempt.

The ensuing Wildcat drive stalled, but
Andrew Wohler’s ’11 punt pinned the Red
Foxes at their own seven to begin the fourth
quarter. Faced with the adverse field posi-
tion, Marist drove 93 yards in seven minutes
and 15 plays to increase their lead to 14-6
on Dinnebeil’s five-yard scamper with eight
minutes to play.

Davidson drove to the Marist 48 on their
next possession, but Heavner was sacked
on third down with four minutes remaining
in the game. Faced with fourth-and-18, the
Wildcats had no choice but to punt the ball
back to Marist.

Given the chance to end the game, Marist
took full advantage. Debowski rushed for 12
yards on third-and-five and for 14 yards on
third-and-13 to allow the Red Foxes to run
out the clock on the Davidson season.

Ben Behrendt 14 successfully converts the first of his two field goals in Saturday’s
season-ending loss to Marist. Behrendt made kicks of 30 and 37 yards as he ac-

counted for ail six of the Wildcats’ points in the game.

Heavner was Davidson’s leading passer,
throwing for 57 yards on 6-9 passing and an
interception. Blanchard led the Wildcat rush-
ing attack, producing 42 yards on ten carries.
Jonathan Adams ’13 led the Wildcat receiv-
ing corps with five catches for 35 yards, and
Aldrich added four receptions for 39 yards.

Debowski killed the Wildcats with 153
yards on 14 carries. O’Neil Anderson added
87 yards on 21 carries. Dinnebiel added 22
yards on four carries and two scores. De-
bowski also threw for 94 yards on 7-18 pass-
ing, although he did throw three intercep-
tions.

Peter Kidwell ’12, the reigning PFL De-
fensive Player of the Week, led the Davidson
defense with 11 tackles. Lemons followed
with nine tackles and an interception. Hunt
and John Harrington ’13 added interceptions
for the Wildcat defense.

The game was the third of the season in
which Davidson scored first, and the first of
those three that Davidson lost. The result im-
proved Marist’s record to 7-3, 5-2 PFL.

Before the game, the Wildcats honored
the 19 seniors who played in their final game
Saturday. Although Davidson was defeated,
the seniors were part of the team that won the
Wildcats’ 50th game of the decade last week
against San Diego. The victory established a
new program record for wins in a decade.

“I am proud of our 19 seniors,” said Da-
vidson coach Tripp Merritt, “and for what
they were able to accomplish for this pro-
gram.”

The Wildcats concluded a season that
consisted of a series of heart-breaking losses
in the Pioneer Football League. Aside from
a 17-0 loss to Dayton, the Wildcats lost PFL
games by margins of six at Jacksonville (27-
21), five against Drake (21-16), seven at But-
ler (14-7) and eight against Marist (14-6).
The losses to Drake and Butler were particu-
larly painful because those two teams are tied
with Dayton for the league lead with identi-
cal 6-1 records.

The Wildcats recorded victories over
Campbell (24-7), Morehead State (16-10)
and San Diego (34-27). Davidson finished its
season with a record of 3-7, and 3-5 in the
PEL.

Reiter ’10 named
Southern Conference
Player of the Year

MIKE FRONGELLO
Sports Editor

_ Davidson forward Charlie Reiter ’10 has
been voted the 2009 Southern Conference
Player of the Year by the league’s coaches.

Reiter becomes the sixth Wildcat to win
the award and the first since Robert Clarke
in 1995. He led the team and the conference
with 12 goals and eight assists, amassing 32
points on the season. Additionally, he earned
SoCon Player of the Week honors the week
of October 5 when he was in the midst of a
nine-game scoring streak

Joining Reiter on the All-Southern Con-
ference first team was midfielder Alex Cas-
key ’11 who was selected to the team for the
second straight season: Caskey finished the
season with seven goals and two assists for
a total of 16 points. His strong season was
highlighted by a two-goal, one-assist perfor-
mance in the Wildcats 4-1 victory over then
No. 25 South Carolina.

Brian McGue ’13 was the only other

‘Wildcat to earn honors in the announcement

of the awards as he was named to the South-
em Conference All-Freshman team. The
freshman midfielder started 14 games for the
*Cats and scored a goal in the team’s stun-
ning 4-1 upset of then No. 6 Duke.

The Wildcats completed their impressive
2009 campaign with an 11-7 record follow-
ing a 5-2 win over Atlantic Sun regular sea-
son champion Campbell in the season finale.
Reiter punctuated his memorable season with
a three-goal performance in the game.

Davidson hopes to build off their tremen-
dous success this season which saw them fin-
ish 10th nationally in goals scored per game
(2.06) and briefly earn a national ranking. The
’Cats will undoubtedly miss Reiter next year,
but they will return 10 starters including Re-
iter’s running mate up top Yannick Pilgrim
"11, who finished second in the conference
in scoring behind Reiter. The future is bright
for the program and the foundation seems to
be set for the Wildcats to make a strong run
at the elusive SoCon title in 2010.
