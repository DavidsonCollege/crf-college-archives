asics steer adeno,

was a selfless and devoted
teacher, always patient, al-
ways generous with his time
and talents. He handled our
“raucous,” “strident” tones
with a sense of humor: (some-
times a stricken grimace) help-
ing us to listen for a beautiful
sound. This sensitivity to

‘music and his compassion for

all men was an inspiration...
We miss him.

YMCA kicks off fund drive

The annual YM/YWCA Christmas Gift Fund Drive, which
will run from Dec. 5-14, is dedicated to George Reedy, the
Davidson student who was killed while teaching in Kenya. (Da-

+ Oct. 21. :
Yi ae Risied will be used principally for scholarships
STM WCA President Jay Silver believes that the Christmas
Drive is an ‘‘opportunity for students to express a concern for
people who have certain needs at a time when giving
characterizes our celebration of Christmas.”’ i

Volunteers will canvass every dorm room, play Santa Claus at
the Post Office during the 10 a.m. hour, and sponsor a coffee
and coke auction.

The fall fund drive was moderately successful with about $1200
being raised. Though the drive netted considerably less than in
previous,years, according to Silver, students traditionally have
given about five dollars each.

Presbyterians drawn back

Davidson studénts eager to return early from Christmas
break will have an opportunity to attend the Presbyterian
student conference sponsored by Davidson Christian Fellow-
ship.

The five-day convocation beginning Dec. 27. will be modeled
after similar Inter-Varsity Conferences.

Seniors Bob Morrison and Bob Cathey conceived of the idea
last spring. With the help of fellow DCF members, they have
organized a major event that will involve over 200 people coming
from all over the South. Various dormitories and homes will
house the guests.

According to Cathey, ‘‘we wanted to help relationships grow
between college students and the older members of the
Presbyterian Church.’’ He explains that some formerly
unchurched students become active in college Inter-Varsity
groups. It is the conference’s objective to help these students
“move to the center of the church.’’

DCF has been fortunate to be able to draw a number of
excellent resource personnel to lead the various seminars on
spiritual life, ethics, campus ministry, and church operation.
Though the event has heen planned for Presbyterians, students

of all denominations are welcome.

justified in my request for a
two course load,”

Bondurant has expressed
concern that this change in
practice is “‘a discouragement
to deviate from the 4 year, 3
course a term pattern.”’ it
provides an initial stumbling
block for the student, she
believes. Bondurant says, “I
encourage an individual as-
sessment by the Curriculum
Committe which would include
an investigation into casual-
ness or superficiality of a
student’s reasons.’’ She does
not feel that a student should
be told at the outset that a
certain reason will not be
accepted as adequate.

Zimmermann, a member of
the CRC, has stated that he
feels past academic perfor-
mance and demonstration of
responsiblity are not sufficient
reason tojustify taking two
courses. “The reason must be
applicable to this term,” Zim-
mermann said.

Extra lab work or participa-
tion in an internship program
would in his opinion, be ade-
quate reasons. Desire to con-
centrate on two difficult

, courses would not be. Zimmer-

man feels that since most
courses are designed for_stu-
danta taking. two additional...
courses, allowing students to

. ..Zimmermann shuns two course plan

concentrate on a fewer number
of courses would be an unfair
advantage.

Burts feels that this change
“reflects a different view of the
academic program.’’ He
thinks that the Davidson pro-
gram is now being seen in
terms of its continuity rather
than as an accumulation of
course credits.

Zimmermann has expressed
agreement with this view,
stressing the value of ‘‘partici-
pation in the whole complex of
academic life.”’

This view of the academic
program expressed by Burts
and Zimmermann is, accord-
ing to Zimmermann, based on
faculty and curriculum as-
sumptions. Any educational
institution, he feels has a
certain paternalistic aspect. ‘I
must try to act as an interpre-
ter of the policy of the institu-
tion.”

Bondurant agrees that Da-
vidson offers a good opportu-
nity for students to take a
variety of courses. However,
she does not feel that students
should be “mothered.” Stu-
dents, she feels, are mature
enough to make intelligent
decisions using forethought
end plenui.,, drawing on
advice from faculty adivisors.
