FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 8. 1957

(All Unsigned Editorials by the Editor)

November 5 And 1960

Off-year elections in five states
proved two things: Democrats were
increasing their strength in the North,
and their cousins in the South were
piling up votes for continued segre-
gation.

The biggest and most far-reaching
victory was the re-election of Demo-
cratic Governor Robert B. Meyner of
New Jersey. He defeated an Eisen-
hower Republican, whatever that is,
in a landslide. The boot that kicked
Ike is now stepping high in the list
of his party's Presidential possibili-
ties for 1960.

Democrats also captured the low-
er house of the Garden State’s legisla-
ture for the first time in 20 vears.
Across the river. to no one’s surprise
another Presidential bud blossomed
forth as Democratic Mayor Robert F.
Wagner scored an easy victory. Demo-
crats scored a net gain of five mayors
in Republican up-state New York.

Pennsylvania was the same story.
The G.O.P. lost a net of five mayorali-
tv contests. Pittsburg Democratic Ma-
yor David L. Lawrence won an un-
precedented fourth term, thus making

him a possible occupant for the White
House.

In Virstinia’s Gubernatorial elec-
tion the voters faced a man who was
against racial mixing in the schools
and one who was for segregation. In
a quantitative decision the latter can-
didate, Byrd-Democratic Lindsey Al-
mond. Jr. won. The real fact of im-
portance here was that Bepublican-
moderate Ted Dalton in his second

“try for the state's top office dropped
from a total of 45°- of. the vote in
1953 to a 37° in Tuesday's election.

The chief significance of this for
the future is not so much that Eisen-
hower lost another round or that the
Democrats will have a host of men to
choose from in 1960. More important
is the fact that when Democrats from
the North and the South get together
in Chicago or New York or San Fran-
cisco three years from now, they fac
the possibility of a real split between
invigorated segregationists and revi-
talized Northern Liberals.

Probably the only people to come
out on top will be the Television Net-
works and the G.0.P.—G.L.W.

Dangers Of
Specialization

_ Tuesday night as Davidson phv-
sies professors discussed and ex-
plained at the Sigma Pi Sigma meet-
ing the satellite situation it was ob-
vious. despite their ‘optimism about
our ability, that the Russians had
technically tromped the United States.
The apparent power of the propulsion
plant and the accuracy of their guid-
ance system excelled even our hopes
in those fields.

The Western world is reacting in-
stantaneously to the challenge of re-
gaining’ scientific leadership. but in
this contest that will be won not on
a battlefield but rather in a classroom.
the spotlight of attention has immedi-
ately switched to our education svs-
tem. Already there is talk of subsidiz-
ing the technical studies of promising
vouth and of founding a national
science academy similar to the service
schools.

But where does this leave the Da-
vidson student or the liberal arts col-
leges in general?

In the mad scramble to turn out
more and better engineers we ought
to heed the caution of one of Ameri-
ca's greatest atomic physicists. In a
1955 broadcast emphasizing the. in-
terrelatedness of the arts and sciences,
this Director of the Institute of Ad-

vanced Studies warned that “anyone

working at the frontier of such science
is a very long wav from home. a long

wav too from the practical arts that
were its matrix and origin as indeed
they were of what we today call art.

“The specialization of science is
an inevitable accompaniment of pro-
gress: yet it is full of dangers. and it
is cruelly wasteful since so much of
what is beautiful and enlightening is
cut off from most of the world.”

The function of the liberal arts in
relating the world of science with the
world of laughing and crying people
is indispensible.—J.R.J.

school is easier than Davidson.

He went on to explain that al-
though the work is harder than un-
der-graduate work he has more time
in which to do it because he is re-
lieved of so many of the outside pres-
sures that existed while he was at
Davidson.

This alumnus has pointed out a
manifest weakness of our College.
There are. too many organizations.
there are too many committee meet-
ings: A student who is interested in
both getting a good education and be-
ing prominent in extra-curricular ac-
tivities finds that his time is quick-
ly drairied off by the latter.-

There are ‘two solutions. First.
each organization should . re-evaluate
itself in terms of purpose and per-
formance and see if it is really worth-
while. Secondly. the Honorary Fra-
ternity Council should make an ex-
tensive study of all campus organiza-
tions and see which ones could per-
haps be combined and which ones
eliminated.

It is well to remind ourselves again
that the main purpose of coming to
college is to get an education.

YMCA Meets
Many Needs

The Davidson College YMCA has
long been a stablizing force on cam-
pus. In fact, its work extends far be-
yond the limits of the college grounds.
As this week's news bulletin, ‘‘The
Student--Christian,” pointed out, stu-
dent preachers carry the work of the
Y to many corners in this area.

Because much of the Y’s work is
done quietly and off campus, students
in the past have charged it with ‘not
doing anything.” The DAVIDSONIAN
is glad to see that this year the YMCA
is sponsoring programs that do at-
tempt to encourage student interest
and knowledge in important topics.
Tuesday night’s forum on the union
shop is a good example. We support
true liberalism expressed in this way.

The YMCA has planned other pro-
grams for the year that cover religi-
ous, political, and economic topics.
The Y is contributing in a vital way
to the intellectual enlightenment of
the Davidson student, and it deserves
the genuine support of the student
body.

ENDOWMENT STRAINED

Who’s To Pay The High Cost Of Education?

By JIM RICHARDS

Inflationary conditions  ac-
companied by the high cost of
living have presented a serious
problem to the Davidson Col-
lege endowment program as
well as an urgent. crisis to the
individual student.

INDIVIDUALS HELPED

At present each individual
student pays only one-half of
his educational expenses. The
other fifty per cent is being
supplied by the college treasury
through gifts, grants, and inter-
est from the eight million dol-
lar endowment. This simply
means that a great deal of the

money which would ordinarily
go for increasing faculty sal-
aries or extended tibrary facili-
ties is now being consumed for
the purpose of helping each in-
dividual bear his yearly edu-
cational expense.

lf the situation continues
to develop in the present
direction the time may
come when the college will
be called upon to pay an
even larger percentage of
the educational bill of the
student. This would of
course result in numerous
problems. The interest from
the endowment might be to-
tally consumed each year
for this purpose, or the en-

dowment itself might need
to be converted into capital
for footing this bill.

Another alternative, how-
ever, might ve a drastic in-
crease in the tuition and funds
which are paid at present. Duke
University recently considered
this same problem and arrived
at the conclusion that their on-
ly solution would be to raise by
several hundred dollars their
present tuition rate.

DAVIDSON SOLUTION

What is the Davidson solution
to this present dilemma? Will
the college be able to find ad-
ditional outside sources which
can meet the inflationary rise

LETTER TO EDITOR

Critic Lashes Lawrence Editorial

Dear Editor:

We were charmed to discover
that the editor of the DAVID-
SONIAN has finally hit upon
the old controversy about the
ratification of the Fourteenth
Amendment as the cilncher in
his case against human. rights
for Negroes. Davidson must
now have the best-informed stu-
dent, body in the country on’
this rather technical point in
historieal interpretation.

MASS OF REPRINTS

We commend the. editor for
the remarkable devotion to
scholarship that caused him to
exclude all student writing from
the page. (except for his own

Davidson:

Test For Church

By BOB JONES

The history of American Prot-
estantism and higher education
indicates that there has tradi-
tionally been a significant bond
between the two. Of the long-
standing colleges and universi-
ties of the nation, the. vast ma-
jority were founded and nur-
tured by the church. The col-
leges in turn supplied the
church with well trained and
educated leaders.

TIES SEVERED

In the course of time, how-
ever, the outstanding education-
al institutions have seen fit to
sever their ties with the pa-
rental denominations. Harvard,
Yale, Williams, Amherst, even
Washington and Lee (more on
a par with Davidson) etc. have
chosen to become independent
of their ecclesiastical heritage.

tt is interesting te note that

PEANUTS

columns and. one feature), to
make way for such a mass of
reprints, all carefully cut to fit
one point of view.

It is only surprising that such
an authority on American his-
tory. who has published his

‘views on the subiect so in-

cessantly, and has even been
panned by such important pa-
pers as the Daily Tarheel,
should have waited so long to
reveal to his readers that the
Fourteenth Amendment has
ceased to exist!
PRECEDENT

However, we beg to remind
the editor that Anglo-American
law is based on precedent, and

except for the Quaker colleges
(viz. Swarthmore and = Haver-:
ford) the institutions which have
led the way in college education
are the very ones that have
broken the tie with the church.

Explanation for this may lie
in the fact that the church has
traditionally been the defender
of the status quo. In the control
of its colleges the church may
have imparted this conservatism
to such a degree that church
colleges lost their position of
leadership in education.

The Presbyterian Church,
hether she realizes it or not,
is being put to the test right
at Davidson as to whether it
can continue its tradition of edu-
cational leadership. If it does
not actively respond, the lead
will go to the non-denomina-
tional colleges by default .. .

the Fourteenth Amendment has
been accepted as the law of
the land in court decisions for
almost a century, so that nothing
short of a revolution is likely
to affect the strict legality of
the Supreme Court's ruling’ on
civil rights—whatever its his-
torical background . . .

HUNGARY

And we quote: “Isn't the use
of military force to override
local government exactly what
we deplored in Hungary?” Ac-
cepting the editor's analogy to
Little Rock, we wish to point
out that Governor Faubus un-
deniably used the force of state
militia to override the decision
of the loeal schoo! board—the
only body authorized to make
policies for Little Rock schools.

We deplore the fact that it
was necessary for the Presi-
dent to use federal ®-oops to re-
store law and order, (by local
request), and to safeguard the
citizens’ rights from mobs and
irresponsibile demagogues. How-
ever, similar Presidential action
might have saved Hungary al-
so!

— Willard Wolfe

Editor's note:

The editorial to which read-
er Wolfe makes reference was
written by Mr. David Lawrence,
editor of U. S. News and World
Report. It was not written by
the editor of the DAVIDSON.
JAN.

Mr. Lawrence is widely recog-
nized and respected as 8 news-
paper editor, author, and syndi-
cated columnist (230 netvspa-
pers). He is an alumnus of
Princeton University.

We. printed Mr. Lawrence’s
editorial because we felt that
it got to the heart of a subject
that is of vital current import-
ance. The DAVIDSONIAN holds
Me. Lewrence’s views in high
regard.

I THOUGHT TOMYSELF.“SAY. IS
THAT BROWN? “BUT THEN

CHARLIE
I THOUGHT "NO, THAT BOY LOCKS
FATTER THAN CHARLIE BROWN.”

or will. the parents of individ-
ual students be called upon to
pay drastically higher tuition
rates?

This question is, however, by
no means a local college prob-
lem. Recently The New York
Times Sunday edition printed
an article concerned with this
general topic. Benjamin Fine
pointed out the astounding ex-
pense which higher education
will bring in the near future.

$3,000,000,000

At present the nation spends
$3,000,000.000 annually for
higher education. This figure
will have to double by 1970.
Mr. Fine quoted D. C. Josephs,
chairman of the President's
Committee on Education Be-
yond High School, who had
some ideas on how this expense
should be financed.

Josephs said, “Students
should pey a much greater
share of their college costs
than they do. Tuition fees
of $3,500 do not seem out
of tine for the returns a
student will get from his
college education. If pa-
rents cannot afford high
tuition fees they should fi-
nance their children’s edu-
cation on a long-term basis.
tt is estimated that a de
gree is worth $100,000.
That's a pretty good invest-
mont for the money a stu-
dent puts in to get it.”

With a knowledge of the na.
tional scene we might return to
the local Davidson problem stil!
faced with a choice between two
solutions. Either the college
must make a_ substantial in-
crease in her tuition or find
outside sources to make up the
ever increasing deficit.

NEW SUMMIT TALKS

The month of December in Paris will be the setting
of the riew Summit Conference of the fourteen heads of

the North Atlantic Alliance. President Eisenhower is to
present a plan at the Conference designed to recapture

the military and propaganda initiative from Russia. The
President has called seventeen experts into an extraordi-
nary White House meeting to study this new plan.

SOVIET-SYRIAN PACT

On October 28 Syria signed a pact for economic aid
from the Soviet Union; the aid will*be of a monetary
nature and will be used to build railroads, dams, bridges.
and factories so badly needed by this Middle-Eastern
country.

RADIO VATICAN

For the first time in history the Pope will be able to
contact the utter-most part of the world through a two
and one-half million dollar radio station which has West-
ern Europe's most powerful short-wave transmitter.

FRANCE WITHOUT A GOVERNMENT

France-has been without a government for more than
a month. This crisis is in the mind of the Allied officials
while plans are being made for the Summit Conference.
Internally France is suffering runaway inflation, strikes
and civil strife. On the international scene the Algerian
crisis continues to absorb the major portion of French
military and economic resources.

Plutocratic Jaunt

By PHIL LEWIS

Well, we finally break back Into print after a two
week (deserved) silence, and none too soon. All the big
wheels of this sheet are going away on a plutocratic jaunt
to New York, where they are going to observe the work-
ings of “The New Republic” to gain some insight into
liberal journalism. Trask is going to visit his favorite daily:
(The Daily Worker, that is). Hope you all have a real cool
time, even if we weren’t invited.

Did you hear the one Ed Stewart is telling about the
Smutnik? Okay, Ed, the jig is up.

Speaking of rockets and such, the service in the
Snack Bar is certainly not rocket fast. We were there
Wednesday afternoon, and found it took impossibly long
to get service. We hate to concede anything to ‘Con-
formity”, but the cartoon was too true to be ignored. Mr.
Poteat take note!!!

PINK PUTTEES

The Office of the Airmarshal Knight Commander,

Fairman Cumming, second in command of the Peon Army.
has announced that pink puttees will be worn at the Grand

Review Saturday at the Wofford game.

_Dr. Staples’ idea of getting new hymnals for the
Church seemed real good at first, but it seems to us that
the same old hymns are being used. How about a little
variety?
