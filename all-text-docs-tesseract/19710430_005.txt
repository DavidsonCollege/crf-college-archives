Dear Sir:

This is to inform you that your application to Davidson
has been received. After much consideration we have decided
to allow you to enroll in the class of 1975. A 100 dollar tuition
deposit must be received by our office before May .1, or your
place will be given to another applicant. An early reply will,
of course, be most helpful.

Due to other financial obligations, we will not be able to
offer you any financial assistance for the coming year.

Sincerely yours,

Dear Vernon,

Just another reminder that you have definitely been ad-
mitted to Davidson. Again, many congratulations, and (if I
may anticipate) welcome aboard!

You'll be glad to hear that the commitiée has met again
and we've dec.ded (because of your really outstanding qualifi
cations) to award you a 50 percent scholarship with absolutely
no strings attached, Isn't that great! Just try to get that little
1d tuition deposit (we’ve reduced it to $12.50 by the way) in
before May 1, however, or we may be forced, regrettably, to
award your place-to another, undoubtedly less deserving,
applicant.

Just to help you, I’m enclosing a few more attractive,
colorful brochures detailing some of the many advantages of

attending ‘‘the Princeton of the South.”
Regards,
i Ed White

Vernon,

Tired of overcrowded classes? . . . Sick of jammed ac-
commodations? . . . Hungry for lots of individual attention? .
Perhaps you’re looking for DAVIDSON! Located ‘in the heart
of dynamic, coeducational Metrolina, DAVIDSON still pre-
serves an atmosphere of unhurried, scholarly — yet far from
bookish — repose. Activism, alcohol and academia all com-
bine to provide ‘‘with-it’” young swingers with a unique life
style they can 'truly call their own. Timely as tomorrow;
spacious as the past; that’s DAVIDSON! Come on up, no
introduction needed.

Think about it, Vern, and drop us a line, Don’t even
bother about the deposit; it’s taken care of under your full
scholarship. We'll even let you have a single room.

. Ed
Hell, we'll even give you a single hall.

April 28, 1971

Dear Vern,

The administration wants me to write you a post card
so here it is: If you know what’s good for you, come to
Davidson,

Signed,
“A Friend’

Head Spender Establishes
Supersmall Academic Body

Once upon a time—let us
say, oh, in 1967—there was a
small academic community
in the backwoods of Idaho.
-This small academic com-
munity was indeed small,
numbering 70 professors,
1000 students (all of them
more or less male, so that
the community would remain

academic and not licentious)

and four primary adminis-

trators. Though small, how- °

ever, it was good.

At: the head of the com-
munity stood the Head, who
in conjunction with his pri-
mary udvisors Dear Fronds,

'* Dear Birds and Reggie East-

wood, decided that what was
already good should become
better; a laudable. decision,
don’t you think?

For one thing, although
good the academic commun-
ity was said by Eastern
Eggheads to betoo limited
in its ability to motivate

’ students to do unstruetured
work.

As a result Head Spender

set up what was called the
Supersmall Academic Com-
munity and Dear Fronds
was moved from his original

LETTER

post to become Dear to this
new structure.

Dear Fronds was the nat-
ural choice to head up the
Supersmall Academic. Com-
munity. For one thing, his
long .experience of closely
organized academic endeavor
had ‘prepared him Ercellent-
ly to supervise its opposite.

For another thing, Dear
Fronds was about to be re-
placed, and there was simply
nowhere “else to put him.

Dear Fronds was set up
in a large office in one of
the campus’ least frequented
relics of more genteel days
and began the creation of the
Supersmall Academic Com-
munity,

Immediately he: stipulated
that no student from the

small academic community ”

might enter the Supersmall
Academic , Community for
unstructured work unless he
had been highly successful

in struetured study.

This avoided lazy students
in the Supersmall Academic
Community, although some
objected that structured suc-
cess might be an irrelevant
criterion.

Thornton Draws
‘Neutral’ Reply

To the Editor:

After having read the ad-
vertisement which Mr.
Thornton ran in THE DAVID-
SONIAN, I couldn't resist the
temptation of presenting
what one might call a ‘‘neu-
tral,’ third party opinion.

Mr. Thornton's effort to
avail himself of the pages
of THE DAVIDSONIAN in
order to impart to the David-
son College community a
“balanced viewpoint’? is
commendable -and construc-
tive though it sems starkly
clear. that if the. balance
needs tipping, it is on the
other side.

However, Mr. . Thornton
seems to have, to my mind,
considerable misinformation
and confusien regarding the
Vietnam War and American

public resentment which has ,

been picking up momentum
recently.
Reduced to its basic as-

pects, the Vietnam War is, .

as many critical Americans
have come to realize, a war
of nationalism. This fact is
historically substantiated.
What divides Vietnam into
two halves is simply a ‘“‘tem-
porary military demarcation
line,’ not a boundary be-
tween two sovereign. states.
In view of this fact, it
wouldn't make much sense
to talk, as Mr. Thornton did,
in terms of ‘‘the communist
aggressors’’ unless ‘one is
prepared to call the success-
ful effort of the Yankees in
the American Civil War

“aggression against the

southern states.

The analogy may not be ‘

perfect but’ a substantia!
parallel is quite discernible.

At a time when American
public opinion has justly be-
come critical of the policy
of the Administration on the
war, and at a time when an
increasing number. of res-
ponsible Americans (Profes-
sor Patterson,’ for one) are
engaged in a concerned peace
effort to end the ghastly war,
it is a pity to see the whole
effort being branded a ‘‘gang-
ster warfare against our
President . .

The Nixon Administration
is not infallible. And when
it errs, the people are obli-
gated to correct its mistakes.
It is sheer naivete to equate
every peace effort with
“communism’’ and ‘‘dis-
ruption” of the government.

People can’t exercise their
influence by complacently
and “‘loyally’’ fashioning their
thoughts after that of the
government but by being
critical and objectively in-
formed of itheir country’s
affairs ang ite dealings with
other, nations, This, I think,
is the essenee of freedom. —

Freedom is not a museum
piece only to be carefully
kept away and be proud of

_ for its own sake. If it can't

be put in&® practical use, it
is as good as nonexistent.
Tesfaye Demmelash
International Student

: Davidson College

Dear Fronds and his panel
of advisors furthermore de-
clared that, although all
work in -the Supersmall
Academic Community was to
be ungraded (pass-fail), all
members must receive one
Supergrade each term or else
go back to the small acad-
emic community.

By the end of 1971 the
Supersmall Academic Com-
munity contained all the
best students in every class.
The creative students, how-
ever, had returned to their
natural habitat at the bot-
toms of their classes.

Upon their freturn. the
Eastern Eggheads noted how
remarkably Dear Fronds had
succeeded in distilling the.
small academic community
into the Supersmall Academic
Community.

In the meantime there was
a crisis situation about the
person of Head Spender.

For one. thing, Head -Spen-
der was also’ Head Bread-
winner for the small aca-
demic community, but a
bakery crisis had made it
increasingly difficult for the
Head to continue to make
Headway in both roles.

Therefore a new Subhead
Breadwinner was brought in,
a much, experienced man by
the curious name of E.
David Corncob. Corncob, . by
Mrs. Parkinson's. Law, need-
ed two Subsubhead Bread-
winers to. fulfill his bread
quotas.

Also Dear Birds had
changed his name-to Reggie,
Eastwood had dropped the
Reggie and become some-
thing ill-defined, and the new
Dear of Studs was named
Wildberry,

At this point an alert young
student noted that the ad-
ministration had increased
itself by doubling plus one
in four years (four top-level
to 9 from 1968 to 1972),

This alert young student,
having read Herman. Kahn,
extrapolated to discover that
by the year 2000 there would
be 1295 administrators at the
top. level.

From this the alert young
student concluded that by
that year the small aca-
demic community would
either (1) no longer be small
or (2) contain nothing but
administrators.

However, as the alert
young student was about to
leave the small academic
community in Idaho for the
wider world, he decided he
didn’t care, anyway.
