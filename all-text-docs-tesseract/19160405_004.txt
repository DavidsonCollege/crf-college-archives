DAVIDSON'S GOLF COURSE
PRAISED BY EXPERTS

Mr, Carl Anderson, the golf profes-
sional who recently gave an exhibition
here, was very enthusiastic over the local
course. He remarked that “in holes 3
and 9 the Davidson course has two of
the most interesting short holes that can
be found on any Southern course.”” Mr.
Scott, of Boston, who accompanied him,
said that this course is the only one he
has ever found near a college campus.
It is also one of the most interesting be-
cause of the care needed in playing each
hole.

Since Mr. Anderson was here a new
interest has sprung up in golf on the
campus. Three new members have been
added to the club roll.

The president of the club announces
that the first rounds of the annual handi-
cap will be played Monday, April 1oth.
