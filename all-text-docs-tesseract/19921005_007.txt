In Black and White: Allison

Is PC All It's Cracked Up To Be?

Some people thought that our
article last week presented black
students as more racist than white
students. That wasn’t our inten-
tion. It was our intention to point
out that racism exists
“on both sides,” so to

demand it.

Now what if I’m refereeing an
intramural soccer game between
one team with only white players
and one with only black players. If

this and accept him for who he is.
But if he is racist or has strong
prejudices, and tries to hide the
fact by acting like the “true sympa-
thetic friend” who understands all

the hardships of be-

speak, and that therac-
ism that is occasion-
ally directed towards
whites is somewhat
more frequently di-
rected towards blacks.

This week’s ar-
ticle is again in the
form of a theoretical
conversation.

Scott: In the past
year or so, it has be-
come politically cor-
rect to call black

people ‘“African-
American” (even
though “black”

ing a minority in a
majority-ruled soci-
ety, anyone can see
right through him.
Scott: Why is it
acceptable for a
black person to wear
asweatshirt that says
“black power,” but
it’s not acceptable
for a white person to
wear a shirt that says
“white power”?
Most people (includ-
ing whites) assume
that the white person
isracist. Why should
we not view a shirt

doesn’t seem to of-

fend). Ifweweretodo
the same for white people, we
would have to call them “Euro-
pean-American,” and yet nobody
insists on this. Why the interest
among many blacks for historical
racial origin?

Deidra: You are dealing with
a minority group that has been
oppressed for hundreds of years
and a majority group that has been
the oppressor. (Despite the fact
that slavery as an institution has

notexisted for 120 years, there are .

still many instances in which blacks
are being oppressed.) Blacks have
come to demand to be identified as
they choose, not as other people
choose. If you want to break it
down, it is not important what
people want to call blacks (or any
other minority group) but rather
what minorities want to be called.
There is a certain sense of pride
that is associated with racial iden-
tification, and that comes from the
racial group in particular, not from
the views of the majority.

Scott: So I guess the reason
we don’t call whites ““European-

Americans” is because they don’t

I make three calls in a row in favor
of the “all-white” team, are some
of the black students going to as-
sume that there are racial motives
for this? That I might be racist
because I’m white? That may
sound silly, but it’s a thought that

crosses my mind: so many. white -

people are still prejudiced; I don’t
want to be grouped with them in
the minds of black students,

Deidra: Some of them may
think you are being biased, but
others won’t give it a second
thought. Of course let’s be realis-
tic. If you were playing on an all-
white team against an all-black
team, and a black referee made
three calls in favor of the black
team, wouldn’tsome of your team-
mates think favoritism, even for a
moment?

I don’t think that blacks stu-
dents will immediately think a
white student is racist just because
he’s white. It depends on the way
the person portrays himself with a
group of black students. If he
doesn’t care about race and acts
like himself, the group will sense

that says “black
power” in the same
light that we view a shirt that says
“white power”?

Deidra: Again we are dealing
with an issue of minogity pride.
Black people and other minorities
must exhibit racial pride, whether
it be through shirts, paraphernalia,
or minority organizations, in order
to keep their position in society.
The majority doesn’t really have
to exhibit racial pride, because its
position in society is assured. If a
minority sits by and doesn’t put
forth the effort to make his pres-
ence known, he will be ignored
because his views on life are not
the majority’s views.

If you have a friend— white,
black, whatever— who is willing,
sit down and discuss some of the
ideas we throw at you. We hada
mind-blowing conversation the
other day (the contents of which
are reproduced here and in next
week’s column) and man, did it
make us think. It’s amazing what
alittle awareness can do for the ol’
cranium.

by law, be spent on money and
_ food foranimals—even for the pets
who managed to stay with the
people who love them.

Mesi of us who have ani-
mals—or whose animals have us—
depend so much on that uncondi-
tional, accepting love they give us.
Think of what they give us: a wag
~ of the tail makes a long day seem
unbearable; having a furry face
asleep in our laps as we sit on the
couch studying or grading papers
until all hours of the morning; a
cold nose pushed against your face
at dawn, reminding you that it’s
time to get up and walk those three
miles you promised; the warm fur
of a cat asleep next to you on a
rainy night. And they ask for so
little in return. Now imagine for a
moment what you would do if you
were told that you could have food
and water for your family, butnon-
human members would have to go

hungry. Think of the pets youhave
or have had: think of them, trying
desperately to find water to drink.

And nothing can be done for
them—nothing, thatis, except you.

You can help the animals in
Florida and Hawaii. All it takes is
a little cash—two fewer beers a
week, beans instead of meat, a
matinee movie instead of a night-
show. Five dollars from a hundred
people could give 1500 animals
food, water, and medical attention
for two or three days. Their sur—
vival depends on you; where are
your priorities?

Money can be donated to the
following organizations by check,
credit card, or by mail. All you
give is tax deductible.

Buta greaterreward exists. If,
as Yale philosopher Vicki Hearne
has pointed out, the way back to
Eden is for each person to respect
and recognize the dignity of each
animal’s soul, then your contribu-
tioncan bring usall onestepcloser.
After all, wasn’t taking care of the
animals one of Adam’s tasks.

What have the principles behind elections on the Davidson
campus become? This election seemes to have a degree of confusion
and inaccuracy behind it. In the October 2- 4, 1992 SGA Flyer, for
example, the SGA is still asking Independents to nominate their
Homecoming representative when a name has already been volun- ©
teered to the ballot. Other flyers that were intended to inform the
student body of the elections were posted October 2—the day of the
election. If flyers were intended to inform us of the election they
should have been posted before the election seeing as the PCC knew
this election date weeks ago. Wright stated that, as President of the
PCC, the nomination of the Independent representative was out of his
hands after he had informed the Independent Senators of their job in
finding a representative. Asa leader on this campus shouldn’t he be
more concerned about the election’s “accuracy”?

In the same Davidsonian article from September 21, Foxx ex-
pressed that re-elections resulted in more work for SGA members and
smaller voter turnout. Even so, I feel thata re-election is in order—not
necessarily because who is the Homecoming Queen is such an issue,
but because of the principles behind a fair and justelection. As itis now
this election is anything but that.

Jones, who had never met Landry, was one of the men who delivered
the news.

For 29 years, Tom Landry was the Cowboys. As Johnson
reported, Landry led the team to “a record between 1966 and 1983 of
209-81-2, which included a streak of 18 consecutive winning seasons,
13 division championships, five Super Bowl appearances and two
Super Bow! wins.” But Landry was much more than just a winner; he
was a man with class. One day after his tactless dismissal, a reporter
asked Landry how he felt about being fired. Landry responded in his
usual classy manner by saying, “I think I’m too far along to think about
coaching another team, but I was looking forward to this year. I
thought it was going to be a tremendous challenge. But that’s over
with. It’s a chapter closed. This is the worst scenario, I guess, but I’m
not bitter.” Well, I’m bitter, and I think always will be.

You justdon’t treat people like that. I know Jerry Jones has tumed
the Cowboys in to a winning team, and I know he doesn’t care that I _
hate the Cowboys. But I will go on hating the Cowboys, and I will
never forget the lesson Jerry Jones taught me about dealing with other
people. So, this week the Philidelphia Eagles are my favorite team, and
next week my favorite team will be whoever is playing the Cowboys.
