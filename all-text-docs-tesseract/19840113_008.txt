Basketball Team Upsets Furman, South Carolina

By STEVE SOUD

After a Christmas break with a dismal
dearth of wins (the Cats lost in succes-
sion to the Citadel, Miami of Ohio, and
McNeese State), an extraordinarily
young basketball team won big games at
the wire over Furman and South Carolina
before succumbing to UNCC Monday
night.

Furman

The Wildcats stunned amore experi-
enced Furman team in Greenville, 70-
65.

Down by ten points with eight mi-
nutes remaining, Davidson played an in-
spired, unrelenting brand of ball that
turned a Paladin gimme into a Wildcat
upset. On defense the young Cats did
whatever was necessary: good block-
outs, a key steal, forcing off-balance
shots.

On offense Gerry Born and Kenny
Wilson made big three-point plays while
Pepper Bego launched a soaring three-
point field goal. Then, with 2:33 remain-
ing, freshman Chris Heineman sank a
19-footer to put Davidson ahead, 63-62.
Free throws built the lead to 68-62 in the
last minute, but Furman cut into that with
a three-pointer of their own. A second
Paladin three-point try missed, and Bego
scored a layup at the buzzer to make it
70-65.

The game evened each team’s South-
ern Conference record at 1-1. Wilson
scored 22, Bego 16, and Ted Wolfe 10.

South Carolina

“It wasn’t the prettiest, but we'll take
it,” Hussey said of his team’s 53-52 upset
of the highly regarded Gamecocks. “Our
guys played the hardest of any team I've
seen this year.”

Essentially the Wildcats combined
sophomore Pepper Bego's deft (6 of 9),
arching outside shot with Kenny Wil-
son's pulverizing all-around game.

Bego’s ACBM (Anti-Carolina Ballistic

Missiles) prompted Gamecock Coach
Bill Foster to say, “You might have to
check him for a hernia.” Wilson’s out-
standing numbers spoke for themselves:
14 of 20 from the field, six rebounds, and
one blocked shot for 29 points.

South Carolina took a scant 24-23
lead into the locker room at halftime. but
three quick Wildcat baskets (one Jim
McConkey jumper and two KW baskets
that included a dunk) moved Davidson
ahead, 29-24.

As the minutes waned and David-
son’s lead was never more than three
points, the young Cats showed consider-
able poise. McConkey hit a clutch
baseline jumper, and Ted Wolfe made a
heady time out call when he couldn’t in-
bound the ball. To worsen matters, offi-
cials made several less-than-judicious
calls against the Cats, yet they retained
their poise. Hussey said, “Any time you
have three sophomores, one freshman,
and one senior out there, we'll take a
close win.”

UNCC

Davidson dropped to a 2-6 deficit in
the annual battle for the Hornet’s Nest
Trophy in a 61-56 loss to the 49ers.

An enthusiastic crowd of 5,311 saw
an inspired UNCC team leap to a 9-| lead
with 14:48 left in the first half. By that
juncture the 49ers held a 40-27 lead due
mostly to 70.4 percent shooting from the
field. On offense they couldn’t miss; on
defense they played Coach Hal Wissel’s
“Hastleball” to the hilt.

~ The second half, however, belonged
to Davidson. Playing mostly man-to-
man defense, the Wildcats shut down
UNCC star Melvin Johnson. This attack,
spearheaded by Gerry Born, held
Johnson to 2 points and 2 rebounds in the
second half.

points), with solid assistance from Born
(12 points), led the Cats back on an excit-
ing rally that cut the deficit back to 52-48
with 4:36 remaining.

The game came down to the free
throw line, and UNCC couldn’t hit. But
each of the key rebounds hit off the back
of the rim and flew outside and into 49ers
hands. The Cats sealed their fate by mis-
sing their own clutch shots down the
stretch. The team isn’t dwelling on it,
though; a vengeant Furman looms here
tomorrow night.

Conference Notes

The Southern Conference should
again enjoy a year of parity if early sea-
son indications are reliable. A surprising
Citadel squad upset Marshall, generally
conceded second in preseason polls.
Meanwhile VMI stunned East Tennessee
State in Johnson City, then ETSU upset
Western Carolina in Cullowhee. So hold
on for the ride. Kenny Wilson's 19.1 ppg
ranks him around 3rd in the conference.
Davidson leads the SC in defensive field
goal percentage.

Hernandez Quits Team

averaging 9.3 points and 7.8 rebounds a a

According to senior Cc-cptain Kenny

Wilson, who played with Hernandez for
one year at South View High School, his
decision was not unexpected by the
team. Wilson said Hernandez had the
chance to be a great player, but the team
and the coaching staff were having to
make too many concessions and com-
promises to accomodate Hernandez.
Wilson suggested that Hernandez’s
problems were largely mental. “Some-
thing had to give,” was Wilson’s com-
ment. Wilson added that though the team
will miss Hernandez’s basketball talents
they will be better off down the road for

mnory,

having a more unified team. Wilson said
the incident is largely forgotten by the
team.

Coach Bobby Hussey imposed a one-

aN Suspension an Hepnandes neies e
t

he Citadel gatne. Hernandez, however,
chose to leave school. Apparently, the
turning point in the affair occurred in the
game against the University of the South,
when Hernandez said he was benched
after grabbing a rebound and then com-
mitting a turnover.

Hussey said Hernandez “had indi-
cated several times in the last two months
that he is no longer interested in playing
basketball and no longer interested in at-
tending college because of the day-to-
day discipline that is required to be a suc-
cessful student and athlete.”

Jim McConkey, Gerry Born, and Ted
Wolfe will share time at Hernandez’s
starting forward spot.
