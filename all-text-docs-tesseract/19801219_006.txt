Davis would have studied
under a two-year interdisciplin-
ary program in Politics, Philo-
sophy, and Economics (PPE),
but would have concentrated on
philosophy and economics.

Blaine Sanders, a history
major from Johnson City, Ten-
nessee, sees the Rhodes scholar-
ship as a “‘pinnacle of achieve-
ment.” He said that the process
of applying in itself is a good
experience because it forces a
person to take a more objective
look at himself.

Dear Mr. Bad Bernard and Mr.
Bonehead,-

Regarding Women’s IMAC
basketball, we are appalled at
the misleading nature of the
teams’ names. Such names as
Penthouse Rowdies, Hot to
Trot, Twice as Nice, Silly
Rabbits, and Burkland’s Babes
seem to imply a certain social

_ atmosphere at Davidson Col-
lege. We know for a fact that

Sanders also would have liked
to participate in the PPE pro-
gram, concentrating on compar-
isons between the English and

_ American political systems. He

was particularly interested in
studying legal ethics at Oxford.

Sanders plans to become a
lawyer.

David Waddill, a history
major from Winston-Salem,
North Carolina, said he was
interested in studying under
Oxford’s tutorial method. He

also feels that by exposing a.

student to different lifestyles

such an atmosphere does not
exist.

As astute male observers at
Davidson, we have suggestions
for more appropriate names
which would more accurately
depict the situation among the
coeds. Such names as the
Frigidettes, the Ice Boxes, the
Igloos, and the Gigantic Glac-
iers seem more suitable.

The Illegitimate Sons of
Goodell and Porter ’81

foreign study forces a student
to question what he really
believes in.

Waddill was also interested in
the PPE course. He plans to go
on to law school or to combine
work in law and business.

Rhodes candidates’ go
through several stages in apply-
ing for the scholarship. They
first give a personal statement
to Davidson’s Graduate Fellow-
ships Committee, which then
reviews it and gives the appli-
cant practice interviews. The
applications are forwarded to
state committees which select
two nominees to go to district
competitions. Each district sel-
ects four Rhodes Scholars.

Graduate Fellowships Com-
mittee Chairman Lance Stell
said he would like to see more
students apply for the Rhodes
and other graduate scholar-
ships. No women applied for the
Rhodes scholarship this year.

“Stell hopes more people will

apply because ‘‘our students
should be competing and win-
ning.’’ He said faculty encour-
agement is a key to increasing
the number of applicants.

Women’s basketball falls
to Belmont; to face Irish

' By LISA YOUNG and
DEBBIE CARLTON

Staff Correspondents
The women’s basketball team

battled Belmont Abbey in
strong second-half effort, but a
large first-half deficit left the
Lady Cats out of the picture in
an 88-60 final.

The Davidson team had prac-
ticed together only two weeks
and could not pull things to-
gether early against the strong
Belmont Abbey team. Belmont
Abbey recruits women players
with scholarships for all team
members. ;

Coach Dee Mayes said she
was happy to see the much-
improved play in the second
period, especially the better
offensive drives and shooting.

Mike Frankhouser was David-
son’s high scorer with 25 points,
followed by Carol Heppner with
19.

The fourth game of the
season will be against a tough
Notre Dame team on January 4
in. the Charlotte Coliseum.
Mayés said that if the Davidson
team plays at its best, it can
stay in the game.

This year’s team has the
talent to play first-class basket-
ball, but needs time to play
together. Bad passing and poor
shooting, which have plagued
the team so far, should disap-
pear as the women get time over
break to work on team skills.
Improved team play and a lot of
hard work could be the start of a
winning season for the Cats.

Wrestlers squish Pfeiffer;

Catawba squashes Cats

By STEVE SOUD
Staff Writer

A 31-20 mild shocker over
Pfeiffer on Saturday was ‘‘a
good taste of victory as we go
home,’’ said wrestling coach
Bob Estock. Although the win
followed ‘a 34-12 loss at the
hands of Catawba, already the
young season has spotlighted a
few unexpected talents.

Estock has found a few
pleasant surprises, particularly
in John Briedenstine (150),
whom Estock described as ‘‘ex-
ceptional.’’ In the Catawba
tourney, Briedenstine lost to
the Catawba number one man,
Jay Gerish, by a single point.
Just a few days later, Brieden-
stine held the upper hand as he

turns in the fall, Kiss will
probably go JYA to France.
Thus, The Davidsonian will

have a single editor except for .

the rest of winter term.

‘“We’ve been planning this
since the summer,’’ Siman said,
“Elizabeth and I think enough
alike that there won’t be a
change in editorial policy while
we take turns going abroad.”’

Kiss and Siman plan no
major staff changes at this
time. Senior Donald Caldwell
will replace Siman and Kiss as
news editor.

Campaigning had many side
benefits, according to Kiss and
Siman. They were able to
recruit some new staff members
and hear students’ views on Th
Davidsonian.

Kiss is a sophomore from
Alexandria, Virginia, and has
not declared a major. Siman is_a
junior philosophy major from
Charlotte, North Carolina.

Anyone interested in any
aspect of Davidsonian produc-

tion should contact either Kiss .

(-6050) or Siman (-6090).

defeated Gerish 12-7 in the
dual meet with a remarkable
comeback.

Also among the three wrest-
lers who were consistent across
the split were Scott Smith (134)
and Van Wagner (142). Estock
says the junior 134-pound
Smith ‘‘is getting back in his
old form. He’s the veteran.”’
Smith picked up a pair of wins,
including a 7-0 decision over
Catawba’s Scott Ferrish and a
10-2 drubbing over Al Baretta
of Pfeiffer.

‘“‘Van Wagner continues to
improve and is doing an ex-
cellent job,’’ continued Estock.
Wagner turned Pfeiffer wrestler
Billy McWilliams’ gaze to the
lights, pinning McWilliams in
1:25.

In the Catawba meet, fresh-
man 118-pounder Eric Hill sup-
plied the half of team points
that Briedenstine and Smith
didn’t. Hill was pounding Andy
Chappell 11-0, and the Catawba
wrestler’s shoulder blades had
touched the mat several times
before the referee decided that
Chappell had been stalling too
long. Hill won by default,
something rarely seen. Other-
wise the match was all Cataw-
ba, as the visitors picked up
four pins.

_ Pfeiffer helped the Cats to
Victory as they were unable to
fill three weight classes. Mills
Antly (118), Lance Stokes
(142), and Tate Nichols all
picked up forfeits. Eric Reints-
ma engineered a 9-6 win over
Doug Campbell, and Wagner
and Smith added the remaining
points to the Wildcat cause.
Estock felt that it was ‘‘a
good win,” but that Pfeiffer had
“little depth.” ,

Looking ahead, Estock’s
squad has until January 14,
when they travel to Furman.
Until then, the team needs to
“learn to stay off our backs. We
must learn to fight, and be more
aggressive. The kids will have
to work hard over vacation.
