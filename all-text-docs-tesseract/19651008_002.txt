Facts Of The Matter

We have been encouraged during
the past few days by the supporting
statements, not just by Independents
but even by fraternity men, in ref-
erence to the editorial opinions ex;
pressed in this column last week.

Intending by our statements fe
rompt a reasonable explanation for
the heretofore unexplained action of
the Interfraternity Council ‘to prohibit-
ing dormitory contact. between fresh-
men and fraternity men, we are
somewhat convinced by the misguided
opinions expressed in the forum on
this page that there is likely no an-
swer for the IFC's decision.

What is even more appalling now is
the complete lack of information with
which Al Carson in his tetter to the
editor and Mike Harrington in his col-
umn this week have defended the-IFC.
Point by point, may we set the record
straight!

THE DAVIDSONIAN at no time
“lauded the actions of the faculty
concerning fraternities last spring.

An April editorial after the month-
ly faculty meeting stated, “We now
have a weak thing full of ‘lumps
which would only complicate any last-
ing solution to a full social life for
each Davidson student.” We hardly
see that as commending the profes-
sors’ action.

Furthermore, not one word con-
cerning the fraternity issue was to
be found in the editorial columns of
THE DAVIDSONIAN during May of
this year, as Carson suggests. In ad-
dition, the only mention of fraterni-
ties on the news pages are four para-
graphs describing faculty action in
May and a small story on the adop-
tion of the rules governing rush for
this year.

What the writer means by “al-
ready passe” is also confusing. Rather
than old or out-of-date. “the fraternity
issue” is currently under the careful
and official scrutiny of the entire col-
lege community.

As an IFC officer, Carson should
well know that THE DAVIDSONIAN
had no direct hand in the formulation
of the current rush regulations, for,
as Carson states, the faculty com-
mittee presented the IFC with a frame-
work in which to operate.

But this framework is, in general,
exactly what the IFC had ordered only
one month before, when they “‘strong-
ly urged the adoption of the Mc-
Gavock report.” (Professor W. G. Mc-
Gavock was acting chairman of the
faculty fraternity committee last
spring.)

Carson implies that the framework
and rules were all a burden to the IFC.
We recall stating editorially on April
16 after the IFC endorsement, “The
fraternity representatives are at the
most grabbing for the mildest-sound-
ing proposal for them.” The frater-
nity representatives received just
what they asked for in their endorse-
ment of the faculty committee’s rec-
ommendations.

The writer also erroneously states
that the 7:30 p.m. clause is a faculty
rule. The faculty resoundingly defeat-
ed several such stipulations in their
April and May meetings. yet proceed-
ed to direct the faculty fraternity
committee to work out a rush system

in accordance with the wishes of the
trustees.

As flattering as it may sound, we
must deny any “starring role” in the
formation of the current rules. We
rather unqualifiedly called for the
adoption of the Fraternity Evaluation
Committee's nine immediate recom-
mendations and still maintain that this
would be the most practical solution
to any system of delayed rush. We
felt then and feel now that sophomore
rush would render unnecessary the
sort of restrictive and detailed rules
which now plague both frafernity men
and freshmen. ,

Harrington,. poor féllow, is even
further off-base. He, too, fails to rec-
ognize that the IFC actually endorsed
the stiplations which were eventually
presented to them—the recommenda-
tions of the McGavock committee. The
IFC should have realized what they
were endorsing in the form of the Mc-
Gavock report.

The columnist himself shows “a
consistent disregard of both pertinent
facts and fair play in his frantic at-
tempt” to support the IFC’s actions.
Substitution of the phrase “fraternity
man” for “upperclassman” would in-
deed clarify many points in the new
rush procedure.

As Carson states, “The council does
not have now, nor has it ever had,
any jurisdiction over Independents.”

We have a certain distaste for
chiding words thrown back and forth
across a newspaper page. Yet, with
such irresponsible charges made in
the forum of this newspaper, we
would feel sorely at fault in not set-
ting the record straight.

Had the IFC last week shown that
they were making an earnest effort in
trying to establish a practical set
of regulations, we would have had no
beef. But by failing even to attempt
an expianation of the rules, especially
the “no contact” clause, the council
presented a facade of obstinacy.

From the clarifications and remarks
made at its meeting this week, the
IFC has indeed improved its attitude.
We only hope that a more careful con-
sideration of the facts involved might

revent the recurrence of such mis-

informed statements as some in the
forum this week.

Carson says, “The use of just a lit-
tle rationale and thinking can clear
up all of the supposed difficulties in
the rush regulations for 1965-66.” We
agree.

But we feel that more is needed.
Fraternities must be accurate and
realistic in their views of the year’s
events, recognizing not only what has
happened, but why it has happened.

They should be willing to work out
not necesarily better regulations, but
a better spirit, realizing that not only
is their every action under scrutiny
by the college community, especially
by freshmen, but that they too stand
to gain from the already apparent ad-
vantages of deferred rush.

With a better attitude, then, the
need for such extensive regulations
would be minimal.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Graves Blasts Nzongola’s| (‘5 ()' Nine Tails
Criticism Of Clark's Story

Dear Editor;

I cannot help but feel that
Mr. Nzongola’s intelligent, well-
substantiated letter last week,
concerning Johnny Clark's com-
pletely irresponsible writings,
deserves praise from myself

and all others who would serve’

the causes of freedom, equal-
ity, justice, and, most of all,
responsible journalism.

It was good to see him point
out the fact that over half of
the riot deaths were Negroes is
proof beyond a doubt of the
immensity of police brutality in
Los Angeles. Despite the fact
that many of the Negro deaths
were administered by the riot-
ers, and that those shot by po-
ilce were guilty of such inci-
dentals as shooting at. firemen
and rescue workers. running
down National Guardsmen,
storming hospitals, and the like,
there was no excuse for. the po-
lice to handle those individuals
with anything but loving gentle-
ness and human warmth.

In fact, I am sure that if ary
of those killed while resisting
officers had been politely re-
quested to surrender and throw
down their weapons, they would
have done so without the slight-
est hesitation.

Mr. Nzongola’s advocation of
journalistic responsibility was
particularly well-exemplified by
his act of labeling Clark ja liar
for writing that establishments
with ‘Blood Brother" signs were
spared by the rioters.

WELL SACKED UP

Although Clark was well back-
ed up in his statements by such
publications as Time and News-
week (which said, ‘A pattern of
race based selection emerged
in the destruction. Stores and
clubs that had posted signs in-
dicating Negro ownership—
‘Blood Brother’ or ‘Soul Broth-
er’—were almost uniformly
spared), these magizines have
long been noted for bias and
bigotry and a total lack of re-
sponsibility in news coverage.

Mr. Nzongola did not cite his
“good evidence’’ that ‘stores
were damaged indiscriminate-
ly,” but I feel certain that this
ossertion is well-substantiated
probably by a personal inspec-
tion by Mr. Nzongola himself
of the riot scene. :

Most impressive of all.to me
was Mr. Nzongola's intelligent
Statement pointing out that ra.
cial hatred was not a major
factor in the riots.

Here again, Time has merely
shown its prejudice and irre.
sponsibility by supporting Clark
with ridiculous statements (such
as: ‘From early morning. riot-
ers surged through the streets
screaming imprecations at
Whitey — ‘blue-eyed devils’,
‘Okies’, and ‘Cracker’ .
“Every time a car with whites
in it entered the area. word
spread like lightning down the
Street: ‘Here comes Whitey—
get him’ . . . Then young men
and women would rush in and
pull white people from their cars
and beat them and .try to set
fire to their cars’’, etc., etc.).

GENTLE CITIZENS

Probably by no one was the
cause of brotherly love among
all races more fervently es-
poused than by the gentle citi-
zens of Watts.

I feel a kindredship toward
these people because I too have
felt the terrible and senseless
sting of discrimination and bru-
tal treatment. The administra-
tion has discontinued my _ fi-
nancial scholarship on the flimsy
excuse of low academic marks,
but I know in my heart that the
real reason is a deep hatred
by the rulers of Davidson for
“hefty”, blue-eyed, blonde South
Carolinians,

I hope to acquire the support
of Mr. Nzongola and other cham-
‘pions of non-discrimination in
my plan to assert my rights by
blowing up Chambers and pillag.
ing President Martin's house.
We must all remember that the
cause of justice is a never-end-
ing fight.

Dear Editor:

In those bleak days last
Spring, it was THE DAVIDSON.
IAN which lauded the actions
of the faculty in their castiga-
tion of Davidson's fraternities.
It was THE DAVIDSONIAN
which kept alive the already
passe fraternity issue through
May until the end of school.

And, now, sure enough THE
DAVIDSONIAN, under the cloak
of criticism of the IFC, has
managed to get its jibes in at

rule.

fraternities in general (via The
Wall Street Journal, ‘another
national newspaper.”’ and The
Christian Sclence Monitor) and
Patterson Court in particular.

The evaluation of fraterni-
ties engendered by THE DAVID-
SONIAN’S spring fever was
among the primary factors be-
hind the rush regulations which
it now criticizes. It is indeed
incongruous that John Todd
should discredit. the formulation
of rules in which he and his
predecessor played such star-
ring roles.

Still, no matter how inconsist-
ent Todd appears. the fact re-
mains that the Interfraternity
Council is receiving unwarrant-
ed bad press. It is my _ in-
tention to offer explanation for
IFC actions and to élarify dis-
puted issues.

No, the IFC is not 12 frater-
nity hooligans meeting every
Monday night for the purpose of
finding new and better ways to
burden freshmen.
it intend to squelch fraternity
rush. In the Spring of 1965,
the Faculty Committee on Fra-
ternities, Clubs, and Social Life
presented the IFC with the
framework of rules within
which it had to operate. It was
the job of the Council to re-
view the regulations and to pro-
vide workable applications of
them for fraternity rush this
Fall.

SPECIFIC GRIPES

Regarding specific gripes, I'll
begin with the notorious “no
upperclassmen in frosh dorms”
The faculty rule reads,
“The IFC shall have regulations
prohibiting upperclass contact
with freshmen during the week-
days for the entire first semes-
ter after 7:30 p.m. in freshmen
dorms and in fraternity houses.”

Until two weeks ago that rule
stood pretty much as it reads
above. Then came the “dirty
rush" charge. To the fraternity
which brought charges, it. sure’
looked as if ‘‘dirty rushing’’
were taking place. but there was
no means of proving it.

Realizing that the rule must
be made a strictly enforceable,
“black and white’’ statement.
the IFC, after, I promise you.
lengthy deliberation, extended
the rule to its present reading
which insures clear-cut, easily
definable enforcement.

THE DAVIDSONIAN’S con-
sternation over the appearance
of upperclass or upperclassmen
in the rules demonstrates the
naivete with which it has ap-
proached the subject of the IFC,
rush. and fraternities. The coun-
cil does not have now, nor has it
ever had. any jurisdiction over
Independents. Moreover, the
two words, upperclass and up-
perclassmen, appear in the rules
only once each; in Article VII
and in Article XV.

The IFC is not a dictatorial
organization endeavoring to
harm the bleeding heart of THE
DAVIDSONIAN. Article II of the
By-Laws of the Interfraternity
Council of Davidson College
grants the right to the council
to establish all rush regulations
and rush schedules, submitting
a copy to the Fraternity Liaison
Officer.

FIRM BASIS
The new rush regulations are

the result of a new rush sys-.

tem. Though they are bulky,
they are not complicated. They
establish a firm basis from
which to work toward improve-
ment of the Davidson fraternity
system and engage in the con-
tinuing project of what is the
best possible academic and so-
cial climate for Davidson stu-
dents.

If there are those among us
who enjoy worrying over the
regulations and finding new
ways in which the rules inter.
fere with their welfare, let them
continue to do so. However,
the use of just a little rationale
and thinking can clear up all
of the supposed difficulties in
the rush regulations for 1965-
1966.

Yes, you can talk to your
brother. Yes, you can deliver
rifle cards or inquire about
newspaper assignments. If prob-
lems. still! exist, your friendly
IFC representatives, listed in
the Wildcat Handbook. will be
more than willing to lend aid.

I humbly suggest that THE
DAVIDSONIAN return to its ex.
pert coverage of the misdeeds
of the President of the student
body at Carolina—a task for
which it is eminently better
qualified.

Vick
Dear Editor:

In criticizing the theory of in
loco parentis I submit the fol-
lowing description. There are
three domains of responsibility
in which the _ student-citizen
finds himself: the academic,
the civil and the private. If the
student-citizen violates academic
regulations the academic com-
munity may require of him
what it will.

If he violates civil law the
proper civil authority must act.
If he violates his own standards
then the burden of guilt is to be
handled by method of his own
dictation. Parental authority is
not included because with the
exception of certain financial ob-
ligations which they meet they
have become for the student-
citizen more of a moral mem-
ory than an active agent in the
determination of behavior.

Retribution, by officials with-
in one domain, is not -legiti-
mately extended -into another,
except. perhaps. in what cases
of conscience arise. Yet we
see in the operation of in loco
parentis at this school a double
punishment incurred on the
basis of supposedly delegated
parental authority.

Under this theory students vio-
lating civil law or students
whose private relationships have
been exposed are subject to
some form of academic discip-
line. That this is ridiculous is
seen in its converse: i.e., the
possibility of being both ex.
pelled and arrested for failing
to meet a course requirement.

LOCUS UNDEFINED

Objections in general aside,
we are forced now to operate
under the in loco theory. Yet
unwararnted extensions of the
theory are in evidence. The
locus is not defined except in the
sense that anything whatsoever
that is detrimental to the in-
stitution’s image comes within
it and is subject to punishment.

The in loco theory was origin-
ally employed to govern the
thirteen year old medieval
schoolboy, It applied to a spe-
cific area from which the boy
did not leave. This area itself
was sacrosanct; beyond the civil
Jaw. We are no longer beyond
the civil law. ;

The law may give the college
student deferential treatment
but this is a failing within the
law and should be ended. The
infraction of civil law by stu-
dents or the knowledge of their
private lives is no longer de-

finable as within the locus.

In particular, in recent cases
students apprehended by the
civil authority or whose private
affairs were made public have
been either expelled or forced
to leave school. Whether or not
I condone or condemn each par-
ticular infraction or situation is
inconsequential.

OTHER DOMAINS

These boys’ problems should
not have been subject to school
discipline. They fell either in
the civil or the private domains.
These students had left the
Davidson Campus and were for
all intents and purposes mov-
ing in the broader civil domain
and were therefore free of the
school’s concern for ‘image.’

That most colleges do dismiss
boys whose actions cause ex-
tensive embarrassment is a fact.
Yet whether or not it is proper
or fair is another question.
Whether or not the student acts
maturely or not, responsibly or
not, at times with the current
mobility available he is beyond
any reasonable definition of
locus.

And whether or not he is to
be treated as a mature person
on campus, or even, whether or
not he is such, should be of
no concern to the operation of
the broader civil domain. There
he is a citizen with responsibil-
ities and rights and his enjoy-
ment of those ‘rights and his
fulfillment or failure of those
responsibilities is the concern of
the civil authority and should
not in any way affect his opera-
tion within the academic do-
main.

All this raises the question.
I do not present this as an an-
swer; I have not approached
the problem of the nature of
concern and its potentials for
criticism and definition. I would
submit that the theory is at
least inadequately defined and
requires discussion, modifica-
tion and clarification. I offer this
as the beginning of discussion.

By MICHAEL HARRINGTON
Davidsonian Associate Editor

HEY FRESHMEN! The Davidson Greek system
and its IFC have rarely been misrepresented worse
than they were in last week’s editorial columns. Who-
ever wrote the editorial “Suicide Attempt” showed
a consistent disregard of both pertinent facts and
fair play in his frantic attempt to depict the frater-
nity system in the worst possible light.

That editorial implied that the Greeks here
arbitrarily decreed delayed rush and the rush regu-
lations, that they alone are responsible for the ban
on dorm rush and the ensuing confusion. =

Had that editorial wished to be fair, it might
have mentioned that this situation resulted from the
faculty placing new restrictions on student social
organizations, including the rule that there was to
be delayed rush and no dorm rush first semester.

*

* *

TO HALT DORM RUSH the IFC found all dorm _
contact had to be postponed until after January 3.
There are three reasons for this: (1) Under the old
regulations it was practicahly impossible to prove
that an upperclassman was actually “rushing” a
freshman: (2) rush contact can be and was planned
to take place in upperclassman as well as freshman
rooms; (3) there was the distinct threat of dirty rush
by disaffiliated fraternity men and antagonistic In-
dependents, as well as regular rush contact by Lingle

Manor members.

But that editorial missed all these points. And
from this poor analysis of a news situation, the edi-
torial concluded that perhaps “. . . freshman are get-
ting a true picture of how rash fraternity life can

be for some people.”
*

* *¢

TO SHOW “how rash fraternity life can be’’, the
editorial quoted three different articles discussing
everything from fraternity membership to academic
pressures—alil this to show how the recent rush reg-
ulations were all the fault of the Davidson Greeks

and their IFC.

THE EDITORIAL’S BIAS against any set of rush
regs and, I suspect against fraternities in general, is
a

displayed by

r more than its tendency to throw

everything in sight at the poor Greeks.

The editorial next concluded that “. . . the
IFC is falling all over itself in trying to keep this

game called ‘rush’ alive’ — phrases like

their

fickle rules” and “the startling capriciousness of the
IFC” show the editorial’s determination to shift the’
blame from the new faculty regulations to the Greek

Its next claim was that a substitution of the

phrase “fraternity man”

should be made for the

word “‘upperclassman” in the rush regs, to “clarify
many questions”. Such a step would indeed clarify
many questions—it would leave Lingle Manor men
and Independents free to influence freshmen to their

heart’s content, while silencing the Greeks.

The

ease with which the editorial overlooked this point

is amazing.
*

s +

! DO AGREE with the editorial one point in full:
that it is regrettable. that the class of 1969 should
have to be the guinea pigs for the new changes,
changes whether for better or for worse were made

by the faculty last year.

But the editorial writer

prefers to blame the changes and the problems on

the IFC, which was ordered by

to enforce those rules.
*

the same faculty

s s&s

FRESHMEN, THESE RUSH REGS do cause in-
convenience for you and both fraternity men and
Independents. And we all regret it. But we all have

to live with the faculty

decisions and make the

changes work—and I salute the IFC for their efforts
to make these new changes work, even though many
members are personally opposed to the change.

No one likes the rush regs particularly—there
are few who like the faculty interference. But the
present set of rush regs are the most practical solu-
tions to a very complex problem. And no doubt the
changed situation will cause other problems which
somehow we'll have to solve together.

But meanwhile, don’t fall for the anti-Greek
propaganda that says this glorified prep-school at-
mosphere is the fault of the fraternity men.

Student Joins Campaign
To Retire Hetzel’s Number

Dear Editor:

Dr. Scott implictly predicts
that the retirement of Fred Het-
zel’s number will lead to a rash
of jersey withdrawals in years
to come. True, that the team
has upset the otherwise stringent
academic equilibria of the stu-
dent body taken collectively and
in individual units (persons).
This engulfing fever has spread
like the proverbial wild fire,
and hardly a student or faculty
member has escaped an emo-
tional ignition at the sight of
No. 44 and his cohorts.

At this point I believe that
the insertion of a rigorously
drawn analogy would be appro-
priate. Woodrow Wilson, it is
rumored about, attended David-
son for one memorable year. He
only made President of the U.
S., never All-American, S. C.
player of the year, or the David-
son team for that matter. For
this achievement his seraphic
face is forever encased in photo-
gtaphs which adorn our other
wise ornament-bare library.

Had some farsighted profes.
sor persuaded Wilson not to
go to Princeton, think of the
greater glory—an equestrian
statue perhaps. But what is
Hetzel’s fate? He stuck it out,
or, thrived in this college com-
munity for four years. He never
gave up and left a te Woodrow
If Hetzel had been shrewd and

cunning like Woody, he would
have transferred to another in-
stitution and thereby secured
the withdrawal of his jersey.

The reverberations would have
undoubtedly reached publicity
starved Davidson, and the ban-
ners, plaques, signs and an-
nouncements reading “Fred
Hetzel went here’’ would have
unfurled like bribes on Judg-
ment Day. But, no, this isn't
the case. No plaques, no ban-
ners, no signs, not even one
bribe in his favor.

To allay Dr. Scott's fears
concerning number retirement I
would like to set forth the fol-
lowing suggestion:

Whereas, a system of number
rotation could be devised along
the lines of Elpert Umstein's
“Exponential Theory for the
Withdrawal and Returning of
Basketball Numbers from and
to the Game in Dire Emergen-
cies Due to a Surplus of All-
Americans.”

Umstein's study definitely pro-
poses to handle all situations re-
sulting in All-American over-
flow with respect to, and total
coverage of, the limited number
supply.

If we can’t retire his number,
maybe his shoes could be bron-
zed? But the crucial situation
of the world bronze shortage. . .
