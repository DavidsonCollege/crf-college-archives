Moratorium

One of the serious communication
problems in today’s world is the tend-
ency on each person’s part to listen
without hearing.

Being so concerned about his per-
sonal response to the conversation,
the individual often fails to hear what
is being said.

To bring the problem into micro-
cosm, such is the case with student
reaction to Davidson's participation
ia, the Vietnam Moratorium.
a PFotest? In essence, the
moratorium is not

An infringemeni en freedom? Again
it is not.

Students have been so busy reacting
to the faculty decision to suspend
classes that they have failed to gygsp
the full meaning of the Davidson ac-
tion.

Yo be sure the Davidson moratorium
Was spearheaded by those opposed
to the Vietnam war. But it was not
designed:as a proiest. It was planned
as a controntation.-of personal and
community feelings regarding the war.

The moratorium is no moré7an in-
fringement on personal freedom than
was the opening convocation. Classes
were lost in that program, too, and
the thought presented was again con-
troversial. ‘

As in the convocation,*the mora-
torium program will merely present
the idea. It is up, to the student to
formulate his own viewpoint, and it
is up to the academic community to
provide the opportunity for that con-
frontation.

Davidson

Had the Davidson faculty voted to’

support thé national moratorium, with
its day of protest and \door-bell ring-
ing, then perhaps the student would
have no grounds for objection. Then

the school would be endorsing a state-
ment not whole heartedly supported
by its students.

But the Davidson action is not a
protest. Some of the letters received
this week reveal that students have
failed to take note of that fact.

Students simply have failed to listen
to what the faculty was saying in its
call for the suspension of classes.

They are rejecting the opportunity
to confront the problem head-on.
Those who have cried the loudest for
relevance in education are now casting
negative glances on the school’s big-
gest attempt te meet that challenge.

It is a great effort to fulfill what
Rutgers President Mason Gross call-
ed “the role of the university as teach-
er, as guardian of civilized values and
as the critical and moral intelligence
which compels the community to pon-
der its courses of action.”

Upset by the war in Vietnam? Thén
turn off the stereo, put down the
week’s Life magazine and get out of
bed and do something.

Laurence Gould, president emeritus
of Carleton College, singularly sum-
marized the support for an active re-
sponse: “I do not believe that the
greatest threat to our future is from
bombs or guided missiles. I don’t
think our civilization will die that way.
I think it will die when we no longer
care. :

“Arnold Toynbee has pointed out
that 19 of 21 civilizations have died
from within and not by conquest from
without. There were no bands playing
and flags waving when, these civiliza-
tions decayed. It happened slowly, in
the quiet and the dark when no one
was aware.”

Faculty Scholarship

Congratulations are certainly in or-
der to Dr. William P. Cumming on the
important discovery of a British offi-
cer’s maps of the battles of Lexington
and Concord. :

Dr. Cumming has done much re-
search in this area, and the article by
him and Mrs. Cumming in the current
issue of ‘American Heritage” is only
the latest of a considerable list of
published works for the retired Eng-
lish professor.

But it is significant that perhaps

The Pause
That Costs

Talk about the cost of living?

Who ever . would have guessed
that the Coca-Cola, the popular little
trademark ofthe Pepsi Generation,
would someday be a sign of affluence?

When would anyone have believed
that those. modern impersonal ma-
ehines in the basement, or good ol’
Ralph at-the Hub could be the per-
petuators of inflation?

Good heavens, what is this world
coming to?

If things really “go better with
Coke,” it seems that now we will have
to do without things.

And we can remember when they
cost only five cents. ’

the most important writing and re-
search by a Davidson professor in _
the last couple of years was done by
a retired professor. Working faculty
at Davidson seemed curiously undistin-
guished by haviitg their articles ap-
pear in scholarly journals or their
books rolling off the academic press.

Perhaps the primary reason for
this lack of research is the attitude of
the institution towards faculty activ-
ity. Davidson has prided itself on not
fostering the “publish or perish” syn-
drome to the point of not only fail-
ing to encourage research, but actual-
ly penalizing it.

. The system of faculty promotions is
rather hazy, but in the absence of
systematic attempts to evaluate good
teaching, it seems that committee
work, participation ‘in the institution-
al process, is perhaps the largest fac-
tor. ' Sad

Thus a professor, who devotes his
time to research rather than commit-
tee work is probably financially penal-
lizing himself.

Good research has value to the com-
munity of scholars not only for the
contribution it makes to the world
of ‘knowledge, but also in simply
keeping professors who finished grad-
uate school some years ago .up in
their field.

Davidson College would -be-wise-to
offer some inducements for research
and publication’by faculty members.

‘Now I’m Typing Standing

By SAM DARBY

I was over in the Union
this morning trying to purge
the effect of last night's
scotch with yesterday's cof-
fee, and my friend Gil Hol-
land asked me what I was
going to write this week in
THE DAVIDSONIAN.

“Nothing. I haven't got an
assignment yet.”

“You don't need an assign-
ment,’ he ‘said. ‘Sam, you
could really do some good ,
around here if you'd just get
off your butt and do it.”

/ So now I'm typing standing
up.

And since I've got this
hangover, I'm going to do
some bitching.

Dr. Spencer, a couple of
weeks / ago, asked all the
boys who were away last
year to come by and listen
to what he had to say about
the. things. that. went. on

around here while we were

Peter Hobbie was there,
too, and he told us, ‘‘Really, *
T mean really, you all really
wouldn’t recognize the place
it's changed so much.’

Well, Peter, I seem to

have found it O. K. It’s still
seventy miles south of Win-
ston-Salem on Route 601. And
Watts Dorm is still here.
And: Salter and Penick afd
May are still around. |
And there's still a bunch of

hot shot freshmen -from
North (Carolina _ sporting

around. And once in a while
you see a girl. (Hey, what's
that guy doing wearing a
skirt?) t c

One thing Dr. Spencer did
tell us, with a little prompt-
ing, was that he had set in
motion the processes that
©will hire a staff of five pro-
fessional. fund. raisers. to
work full time for the col-
lege.

Does -anyone ‘know what
this means to me? Does any-
one care what it means to
me? Probably not. But I'm
going to tell you.

. The first thing I have to
say is, whether anyone

+ , knows it or not, we do not

live in a free community.
And the reason we don't is
that we have our. alumni-
trustee-chtirch relations to
‘worry about.

* Does anyone know what”

that means? Yes, you there,
with the name tag, tell the
class won't you?

(Hot shot freshman stands
up.)

Well, | think that our alum-
ni - trustee - church relations
are one of the most impor-
fant things thet Davidson

College stands for. This insti-

tution’s primary importance
lies in it’s role as a culture
mould. ,

“We are here to pass on
the ideals and aspirations
that our parents and friends
hold to this and succeeding
generations. j

“And I think that we
try to interpret their mores
into meaningful, up-to-date
ideals and aspirations for
ourselves. And I don’t think
we should give ‘em any
crap.” :

“After all, if it wasn't for
them, we \wouldn't be here.”

How right you are. If it
wasnt for them, we. would-
n't be. here. And do you
know why?

“They give us their sup-
port.”’

That's right, they pay for
it. And let me tell you some-

Story On Tour

To the Editor:
In recent years the press

has often referred to~ the
“credibility, gap’’ between
governmental leaders and

the public. My letter is about
the “‘ineredibility gap,’ due
to the press’ handling of

news and the people from,
)

whom it gets the news.

For it is incredible to me
that the DAVIDSONIAN
writers and staff could have
written the “Professors Visit
Ft. Leavenworth’ (DAVID
SONIAN, Oct. 3) story with
out some reference to other

points made by me in the
interview—especially since |
stressed to the reporter that
I had both negative and po
itive impressions from. tl

These men are performing

thing, son. As long as they
pay for it, they're going to
call the shots.

When it’s them that’s foot-
ing the bills, we will never
make the least progress in
seeing ourselves from any
other point of view than the
socio-economic situation from
whence we came.

And I'll bet you can't even

thing. I'll bet you I'm just
talking sour grapes because
I can't ask my honey over

And, to be frank,” you're
half right. But let. me tell
you something. else.

Yesterday, we were in
talking about the Romance
of the Rose. And Mr. Corn-
well asked the class what
did they find most difficult
in their reading. -

To a man (except me) the

most difficult thing was,
reading an allegory. And to a
man, the same _ remedies

were applied. It was a neo-
high school exercise in futil-
ity. ‘i

The hardest thing really
was realizing that t thipg
should have been read in Old

cation they receive.

There is no doubt in my
mind, however, that one of
the reasons (not the ‘focal
point’) for the trip from the
standpoint of Ft. - Leaven-
worth personnel was to ‘soft
sell”
sell) the idea of an M.A. pro-
gram at the Command and
General Staff College.

Why must “education be
locked up in the classroom?

Why not combine. the
classroom and working ex
perience? For ag long «time,
student teaching has been
seen as valuable—let’s ex-

pand this program to other
departments.

Antioch College (in Ohio,
for those who know of no-

thing above the Mason-Dix- «

on line) alternates semes-
ters in the classroom and
out working. The students
learn by doing.

Wouldn't a student inter-
ested in drama be more
likely to come to Davidson
if he could get credit for
performances — whether at
Davidson or Broadway? ne

Perhaps then, a_ science
major could do research —
and whether or not he de-
scribed something or not —
has he not learned? Should
he not receive credit?

First hand experience, it

seems, is the key which
frees education from the
classroom.

A detailed analysis of a
program like Antioch's, with
experimentation where need-
ed, might just help support
the Blue Sky, keep it from
falling in, and once again
let the sun shine on David-

On Feminine Virtues

The subject of my diatribe is the existence, and
perhaps growth, of an insidious.menace on this cam-

‘pus. It is a special-interest minority group that seized

headlines over the summer with audacious acts that
threaten to put the whole of our American system

in jeopardy.

This group is characterized by its ruthless thirst
for power and desire to destroy valued traditions. It
attacks much of what has made America great.

No one has to tell J. Edgar that they threaten
our national security. They are aggressive and will

stop at nothing.

chapter in the history

of women in America, And it is sad that it came now,
just when women were beginning to make real pro-
gress in learning their place in society.

Now, of course, all the gains of the last two cen-
turies will be wiped out in. a wave of backlash. If
only women had proceeded moderately and had been
satisfied with what they:had, all these problems could

have been avoided.

Women were doing very well as long as they did
those things that they are naturally suited for. Of
course, they began to establish organizations, but most
of them had a good purpose. .

So long as women occupied themselves with whole-
some womanly pursuits, such as bearing children,
cleaning house, reading Ann Landers and going to
DAR meetings, most Americans had nothing against

them.

But then they ‘began a scarcely-concealed drive
for power. They entered business and industry and
have so thoroughly infiltrated it that now they have
intimate access to the seats of power.

Not a businessman in America is without a sec-
retary who is even now conspiring to overthrow him
and destroy all that we hold dear.

This new drive for so-called ‘“woman’s rights’ is
nothing but a thinly-disguised attempt at ruining
the very fabric of American society. Needless to say,
the most overt threat the “Women’s Liberation Move-
ment” poses is to the garment industry.

Business reports show that Berkeley department
stores no longer stock these items that were once the
foundations of the American system.

We at Davidson will play a vital role in the
fight against this movement. Because we represent
a stronghold of power, we must be on guard for traitors
in our midst, as we will surely be a target of this

movement.

Eternal vigilance is the price of masculine su-

periorty.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

of that.

And do you know why? No-
body is trained to think for
himself. The opinion of the

pun.)

There is no _ objectivity.
There is no isolation. There
is no INDIVIDUALITY,
And one of- the reasons for
that is that we are all the

for the Richardson boys and

the Hippies. But they don’t
count. The Majority is the

What I do object to is the
fact that by choosing Octo-

itself with a nationwide pro-
test against the war,

ium in October, two days in

November, three days in
December, and on! and on

Davidson College surely
will not cooperate with this
plan, so why associate our-
selves with this movement
to begin with?

What I hope can be done
is to respectfully request the
faculty, on the behalf of peo-
ple like me, to re-schedule
this day of meditation.

I do not see how any stu-
dent or faculty member
could object to such a plan.

Robert N. Buchanan ‘70
Davidson College

To the Editor:
The faculty of Davidson
College has taken bold, dras-

tic action in an all-out effort
to end the war in’ Vietnam.

Seeing daily death and de-
struction, these brave men
have cried, ‘‘Enough! Let's
stop this thing right now.’

And to back up their
words with stiff concrete ac-
tion they have suspended
classes for one day.

Lest some-suspect this is
not earth-shattering, there
is a story from Duke Uni-
versity wh ere
asked to support a non-
academic workers strike
against poverty wages by
a class boycott.

Speaking for many of his
colleagues, famed _ historian
Joel Colton declared; + ‘Oh,
we support the workers all

~Tight. But. I don’t know if

we could go along with
that."’

When you ask a professor
to suspend classes, you're
asking him to give up some-
thing that’s sacred to him.

A Vietnamese peasant, in-
formed of the faculty ac-
tion, remarked, “That's very
nice. Perhaps the bombing

will not be so heavy tomor- ‘

row and fewer of my coun-
trymen will be killed.
“Meanwhile, though, I'm
going to join the VietCong
and fight for my freedom.’
In Washington at a _ de-
fense meeting, an unidenti-
fied businessman remarked
“It certainly gives me some-
thing to think’ about. I will
join them in praying for
peace—yes, it is true that
we just contracted to’ build

But do not fear, guardians
of the trusted way. All is
hot insanity at the Presby-
terian institution. Sourtes in-
dicate that by November, if
and destruction
has not ended, the faculty
will give up this commit-
ment and return to -nor-
malcy. *

It is only a phase they're
going through.

I say this because I would

making an overt protest.
