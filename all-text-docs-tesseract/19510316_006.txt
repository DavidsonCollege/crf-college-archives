the two cases:

Affirmative: Voluntary chapel has
been effective in many other schools
and could be at Davidson. This
success can be accomplished
through better chapel programs and
more publicity given to those of
special interest to the student body.
Just as you can lead a horse to
water and cannot make him drink,
the student body is led to chapel
but it cannot be made to sincerely
participate; especially is this true
in the religious part of the pro-
grams. The atmosphere of the vol.
unteer’ hall prayer meetings is
much better than that of the chap-
el programs. Even though the vol-
untary programs might not haye
one hundred percent attendance
from the student body, at least they
would have one hundred percent
support of those attending.

Negative: lf you eliminate com-
pulsion from chapel, you eliminate
chapel. This fact can readily be
seen in the aftendance at band
concerts, lectures, and other inter-
esting programs on’ a voluntary
basis. We come to college to be
educated and if that educational
process needs compulsion, then it
is a necessary regulation. Through
chapel we meet, and become close
friends of, ‘many students whom
we might never have met had it
not been through chapel; this in-
stitution is an integral part of the
Davidson Spirit. Even though we
are sometimes doubtful of the true
worth of chapel, the alumni write
back in overwhelming majorities
that it remains in their minds as
one of the highlights of their col.
lege careers.

Good Friday Service

In the sanctuary of the Davidson
Methodist Church on Good Friday,
March 23, will be held a service
of worship commemorating the pas-
sion and death of Christ, followed
by the administration of the sac-
rament of the Lord's Supper. The
service will begin promptly at 8:00
p. m.

For several years this service has
been a mosf significant phase of
the series of lenten services of the
church ‘and community. This ser-
vice, to which the entire college
community is invited, will consist
of a spoken meditation by the min.
ister, familiar hymns and. special
music by the congregation and
choirs of the Davidson College
Presbyterian Church and Methodist
Church. These choirs will present
selections from “The Crucifixion”
by John Stainer.

Baker Scholars
To Visit Campus
For Final Tests

Selection of finalists in the third
annual Baker Scholarship compe-
tition has been completed by the
Baker Scholarship Committee, Pro-
fes B. D. Thompson announced
today. Twenty-two candidates have
been/ invited to Davidson for 4a
two-day program of testing and
interviews on March 30-31.

The Baker Scholarships were
founded in 1949 by a grant from
the George F. Baker Trust which
administers a large educational
foundation established by the late
eminent banker, Mr. George F.
Baker, of New York City. The
scholarships are awarded for four
rears to outstanding high school
seniors whose records in high
school and community activities
give great promise of leadership
in both academic and extra-curri-
cular work. Candidates are select-
ed by a faculty committee solely
on the basis of merit. Need of as-
sistance is not a primary consider-
ation, although the value of the
scholarships does vary from a min-
imum of tuition ‘to a maximum of
all expenses.

Thirteen Davidson students now
hold Baker Scholarships: George F.
Bason, Jr., W. Herman Bell, Lar-
ry J. Dagenhart, Alan K. Garrison,
Robert M. Henry, Mitchell Patton,
and James O. Speed, all of the
Sophomore Class, and Robert S.
Crutchfield, L. Maxwell DeVane,
Harry V. Lamon, Paul Buford
Price, D. Moody Smith, and T.
Alden Williams of the Freshman
Class.

Contestants this- year, Professor
Thompson noted, were drawn from
a more varied list of schools and
from a more extensive geographi-
cal area than in past years. The
finalists who have been invited to
Davidson for further consideration
are:

Eugene P. Bargeron, Savannah,
Ga.; Thomas C. Dove, Phillips An-
dover Academy, Andover, Mass.,
Monroe, N. C.; Kirk Terry Dorn-
bush, Atlanta, Ga.; Edmund Wil-
liam Farrar, Macon, Ga.; Floyd
F, Feeney, Charlotte, N. C.; John
D. Fite, Sanford, Fla.; John Leigh-

lton Green, Jr., El Paso, Texas;

Frederick M. Hudson, Miami, Fla.;
Robert. P. Hyatt, Cherokee, N. C.;
David R. Jones, Durham, N. C.;
Thomas F. Kepler, Mt. Herman

General Ridgeway
Answers Questions

The following recorded statement
by Lt. General Matthew B, Ridge-
way, Commanding General, Eighth
Army, was broadcast on the De-
partment of Defense radio program
“Time for Defense” over the Ameri-
can Broadcasting Company net-
work recently.

“In my brief period of command
duty here I have heard from several
sources, chiefly from the members
of combat: units, the questions,
‘Why are we here?’ ‘What are we
fighting for?’

“What follows represents
answers to those questions:

“The answer to the first question,
‘Why are we here?’, is simple and
conclusive. We are here because of
the decisions of the properly con-
stituted authorities of our respec-
tive governments. As the Com.
mander-in-Chief, United Nations
Command, General of the Army
Douglas MacArthur said publicly
yesterday: ‘This command intends
to maintain a military position in
Korea just as long as the statesmen
of the United Nations decide we
should do so.’ The answer is simple
because further comment is unnec-
essary. It is conclusive because the
loyalty we give, and expect, pre.
cludes any slightest questioning of
those orders.

“The second question is of much
greater significance, ard every
member of this command is entitled
to a full and reasonable answer.
Mine follows:

“To me the issues are clear. It
is not a question of this or that
Korean town or village. Real estate
here is incidental. It is not re-
stricted to the issue of freedom for
our South Korean allies, whose
fidelity and valor under the severest
stresses of battle we recognize;

WILDOCAT CLUB...

football from the angle of the

boys grouped as a team.

Presiding over the meeting
will be Ed Armfield ’37 who
was chosen to lead the club at
its initial meeting in March of
last year. He will illumine how
far the club has progressed in
light of its aims. Mr. Amrfield
resides in Greensboro. .

After lunching at one in the
college dining room, the attend-
ing members, will gather at
Richardson Stadium to watch
an intra-squad game whose
teams will be composed ,of the
men who have participated in
spring football drills.

Begun March 11, 1950 the
club now has a total of 853
members. Its stated purpose is
“to better intercollegiate athle-
tics at Davidson by providing.
scholarships to worthy stu-
dents ((in need of financial
help) to secure a college educa-
tion.”

It is estimated that some
$30,000 will be required in 1951
in order to continue the pres.
ent plan of enlisting athletic
aid among high and prep
school men. Contributing mem-
bers have the option of paying
direct cash, making a pledge
or making extended contribu-
tions over a four year period
thus making it possible to heip
an individual throughout his
entire college career. Over 100
men have joined the ranks of
the latter plan.

Money given to the Wildcat
Club is actually a part of the
Davidson College Alumni Fund.
A contributor may earmark his
gift to any particular branch
of athletics. One man has con-

though that freedom is a symbol
of the wider issues, and included
among them.

“The real issues are whether or
not the power of Western civiliza-
tion, as God has permitted it to
flower in our beloved fands, shall
defy and defeat Communism;
whether the rule of men who shoot
their prisoners, enslave their citi-
zens, and deride the dignity of man
shall displace the rules of those to
whom the individual and his in.
dividual right are sacred; whether
we are to survive with God's hand
to guide and lead us, or to perish
in the dead existence of a Godless
world.”

sistently sent checks each year
of $100 to be used for the soc-
cer team. Officers of the club
were forced to inform him that
there is no soccer team and
the money would be used in
connection with football unless
otherwise specified.

It is presumed that new of-
ficers will be elected at the
Monday meeting. Incumbent
leaders are President: Ed Arm-
field of Greensboro, Vice-Pres-
ident: Hugh Query, Gastonia
and Secretary-Treasurer: Mc-
Allister Carson, Charlotte.

Democracy starts here...

THE WAY I SEE IT, when you're a father you're auto-
matically a Founding Father, too. It’s up to you to
found America in the heart and mind of every young
citizen you add to the census. Because a nation isn’t
history—it’s what's going on right now in your own
children’s minds and spirits.

Totalitarian countries do a top-Right job of founding
their philosophies, their nations, in the hearte of their
youngsters. I think what they give them is faith—faith
in false gods, as we see it—but a burning, positive,
dynamic faith which permeates their lives.

ese students of Shikokou Col-

A Davidson alumnus, mis-
sionary of the college church
and former member of the Col.

charge of Shikokou.

Books may be brought to
the YMCA and will be sent
to Japan in time for the soon
forthcoming April term.

This request is made in light
of the fact that there is no

purchase second-hand texts.

Some folks think we can challenge that faith simply
by being against it. But that’s like scolding an atom
bomb. The only force which can conquer faith is a

greater and a deeper faith.

When I watch my boy and girl in church singing the
grand old hymns ... when I think how they're growing
up with the great faith in their very blood ... when I
multiply them by all the church-going children in the
country ... there's a lump in my throat and a psalm in

my heart.

A psalm of thanksgiving that in them democracy is a
spirit and invincible because it comes from God. A psalm
of hope that they may one day make their faith the faith
of all their generation in every land on earth.

Find yourself through faith a come to church this week
