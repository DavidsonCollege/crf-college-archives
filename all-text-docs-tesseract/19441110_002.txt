School Spirit...

has one, and one which makes a creditable
showing. It is easy to put a cheering sec
tion in the stands at the games, but ay:
idson has not done that in a very credit-
able manner. And there the blame can
only be laid upon the shoulders of the in-
dividual stident on the campus.

In the recent game with Barium
Springs, a bigger and harder fighting
Wildcat team went down before a scrappy

team from Barium. The students, though
they were there for the most part, were
hardly heard, and the team not only took
a physical defeat, but also a mental one.

Davidson has always been noted for its
spirit: win, lose, or draw. A small school,
playing out of its class in many instances
in the past, the Wildcat spirit has been
the backbone of many an upset, and the
support in many a defeat. The men in
the stands have proved the importance of
their contribution, and now the present
student: body has fallen down on the job.

It is up to every man, upperclassman or
freshman, to learn the yells, and songs,
and to get out there and use them Let
the Wildcats hear the fight, and they will
do their part.

Perhaps this spirit is new to some. It
is not something you put on paper; it is
something you feel. The freshman year
at Davidson is the time when- you learn
_to know what that Davidson spirit is.
That is why the freshmen go to cheer ral-
lies, and to football games—only by par-
ticipating in these things can the average
freshman come to be a Davidson man.
_+ This attempt to make Davidson men is
the basis of the whole freshman system.

Ambition...

- There are many things required for success
in college. Development must be physical,
social, as well as academic. The aim of col-
lege is-not so much to teach specific things
but to train ‘the student to find his own way
in the field of knowledge.

task at hand.

Back of this theré is a motivating: idea.
This idea might be ‘named ambition. It is
the desire for accomplishment that must be
basic in our college life. © ™*

It is true that me must set ideals. They
must be of the highest order, comparable to
the stars, which were like ideals to Napoleon,
always to be followed, never to be attained.

We must learn to think. Man can only
make contact-through the mind. vast
reality of life and creation’ can become ours
only when it is reduced, sifted and channeled
into our mental processes.

But ideals and the ability to comprehend/

lic inert until there is a force behind them.
They are lacking power in themselves. There
is a third element which must be added’ to
make a complete picture, a working machine.

Ambition for our use here must be narrow-
ed to mean the motive or the will to succeed,
the. desire to utilize the opportunities. It
implies the factor necessary to obiain to the
greatest degree all that college ha’ to offer.

One of the rarest objects on our campus is

_4 man who tries to get all he can out of every
{phase of his college life.

The statement
might be narrowed even more, to say the
rarity is the man who tries to get all he can
from the academic standpoint.

Too many students anxiously inquire as to
the smallest amount of work possible: never
attempting to explore the vaster field beyond.
The highest delight of a college day is not in
seeing a ‘A’ on a paper but in finding that
the professor has cut his class.

ent parts since it does

not occur as a single
There are two types of ambition in
the scholastic endeavors of the student. One
might be named the “near- sighted” variety,
‘the other the “far-sighted.” One loses much
of its value without the other. Together,
they are priceless. One consists of tenacity,
even drudgery, the other of high- flown as-
piration.

In the case of “near-sighted” ambition we
must have the satisfaction of seeing each
day’s work done. We must view our task

with the aim of complete accomplishment,

without regard for the past or the future.
There must be the joy of’ perfecting each
little. unit-as a whole as something sought
for its own worth. This is to say do each
day’s work as it comes. Prepare each lesson
as it is assigned. ©

Far beyond this _we reach with our “far-
sighted” ambition. It views the whole, the
future, the attainable ideal. It is the end
which we seek by our daily work. It repre-
sents the success, the fulfillment of worth-
while ambition. Do not be mistaken; it is
not some tinsel which allures us like children.
It is the* ability to reach out and grasp life
and live it to the fullest.

Randolph Tyler Knox had grad-
uated from Dodson College -in the
class of ’39. That was the impor-
tant fa¢t concerning: his collegiate
career because he hadn’t been a
Phi Bate or an O.D.K., although he
had been on the staff of The Dod-
sonian, treasurer of his fraternity,
and a member of the track squad.

Randy had left Dodson the day

after he graduated and when next ,

would have found on his card in the
alumni office with

this addition;

“Promoted ‘to the rank of Captain
and receipient of China's highest
military award upon downing his

sixteenth Jap’ fighter.”

Randy came home then, just after
the Flying Tigers became a part of
the U. S. Air Forces. His picture

ly interested in the fact that I was
alone. Once seated he address@h me

row and before I left I had to see
you or someone here at Dodson and
confess to a thing that has tortured
my mind and soul relettlessly since
the day I graduated from Dodson.”

“Well, you can speak to me free-

ly,” I urged, smiling at his anxious
countenance, “This thing surely is

not as bad as you seem to make.

“It is serious,’ Randy went on,

Was crossing the campus for the
last time and as I passed the small,
boarded-up old gym I told myself
as I had many times during my four
years at Dodson, what a help it
would be to the looks of the cam-
pus and above that, what a glorious
fire there would be if that old fire-
trap should some day burn down.

I was now an alumnus of Dodson,

old frame building and piled a heap
of rubbish in the middle of the old
wood floor. Then I set a match to

laughed at his surprised and gapping
stare. 3

This Might

By Hil Masters
The social activities of the schools
are just beginning. I mean by that,
the dances, parties, and social gath-
erings which are being held by the
fraternities or the sororities and the
thegnselves. Along with
functions comes the “plague
blind dates”. Of course
is nothing wrong with blind
dating but it’s something to be wary

of,
Example 1
For instance there is the girl
whose sister’s girl friend has just
come in to town. The poor thing

doesn’t know -an¥one in town and
your friend is so. afraid she'll be
lonely and wouldn’t you love to show
her around? Now this is a very
ticklish situation. Perhaps you think
that if you do “small” favor
for your friend (let’s call her Jose-
phine) she will sometime return the
favor by dating you herself. This
might be true, but is it worth it?

this

And then again you might enjoy
yourself on that date. Who knows?
Example 2

Now here's another example. This
“personality line.” Your
friend (Joe) says he has a date with
a girl at Queens. She has a friend
(they usually do) who needs a date:
Well. Joe -is perfectly frank with
you. He tells you that her hair is
streaked, bleary,
had small pox when she was six,
and that she could use a diet, BUT.
she has a wonderful personality.
Well, this is just what you're look-
ing for (isn’t that silly). You quickly
gobble it up and you're all set. The®
night has arrived; you meet your
date; and you're hopes fall. You've
been tricked. Look at her. Beautiful
blonde hair, clear blue eyes, golden
tan complexion, and figure that
would make Grable envious, but,
(you guess it) no personality. There
you are—stuck. That's just another
of the sad cases in blind dates.
Example 3

Let's take the case of John Cross,
pre-medical studént. John had red
hair so his friends called him “Red
Cross”. His sister, Chris Cross; had
a date for him._Red was a little hesi-
tant about accepting this, but after
seeing a picure of his proposed date
he ‘quickly accepted the offer. It
was a dance and the place
held was gaily decorated in
and rich tones of..blue. Everyone
was there but Red and he had been
detained. Why? Well, his sister had
neglected to tell him that his date
lived twelve miles out of town.

After the dance Red drove her
home watching the quickly declining
gas gauge’“Oh, yes he had enjoyed
himself. She was a very good dancer
and he was not disappointed, but
there he was twelve miles out of
town with about enough gas to take
him to the next corner.

After going through the. formali-
ties. (isn't that a good word) of
saying good-night, Red started driv-
ing home and he ran out of gas ten
miles out of town. There he was
“thumbing a ride” at four o'clock
in the morning in white tie and
tails—

But don't laugh for this might be
you.

“That's exactly it,” I assured him.

Randy sat for a full minute in
silence and then rose to leave. He
left but without first forcing upon ©
me his $4000, in cash it was, in an
old, much-handled envelope. He
told me he wanted it to go toward
a new building for the Dodson cam-
pus, a new gym perhaps.
