“The summer months were

During his voyage to the Phil-

years or more of service would

When he finally arrived home

Columbia Veterans Hospital in
South Carolina.

In 1947 he was married, and

The Sergeant is keenly inter-

done a wonderful job,” was his

his opinion on our present world

Then he elaborated further:
“Kennedy has showed his will-

learned this from my fourteen
years overseas,”

Sgt. Newby did not lave the

If you think you're seeing more Marlboro men

lately, you're right. More than 25,000

smokers all over the country are switching

to Marlboro every month!

You'll know why when you try them.

Marlboro is the filter cigarette with the unfiltered

taste. The secret of the flavor is the famous
Marlboro recipe from Richmond, Virginia... and
the pure white Selectrate filter that goes with it.

Try Marlboro and judge for yourself. On or

off campus, you get a lot to like.
