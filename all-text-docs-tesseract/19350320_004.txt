DIAMOND CHATTER

All over the country the great Ameri-
can game is getting under way.
“diamond chatter”

The old
can be heard from all
sides, and everybody is wondering just
who's going to have what.

We hear from the Wildcats’ lair
that things are looking up. Coach
Laird seems to have the men who
can handle the horsehide both at
the plate and in the field.

Jim Morgan, Johnny Mackorell, Floyd
Bumgarner and Teal Rogers, four of the
leading sluggers last season, are on hand
for the 1935 session and it looks like
they can still hit that ole rock.

By the way, a little rumor-
spreading-bird tells me that a cer-
tain member of the Wildcat base-
ball squad has been offered a very
nice contract to play for some big
league club. He is a very mod-
est fellow, however, and doesn’t
wish to have his name revealed
right now in this connection.

TRACKSTERS BEGIN

Saturday afternoon the varsity and

freshman track teams will display, for
the first time this spring, their full
forces. The respective teams from

Wake Forest will oppose the Davidson
clubs, and-there should be some inter-
esting competition during the afternoon.

Earl Frazier, although he isn’t
expected to have such tough op-
position Saturday, will furnish
good entertainment. John Lee al-
ways scales the bar in a spectac-
ular fashion, and there will be

Junior Managers will be elected

Eight Of Eighteen Games To Be
4 Played Here

The first practice game of the current
baseball season was held by the varsity
squad last Saturday afternoon, March
16, between two teams chosen from
among the candidates for membership
on the ‘Wildcat team. While this marks
the beginning of the practice games,
batting and infield practices have been
being held for over a week. All the
pitchers worked for an inning or two in
Saturday's game, and their performances
gave indication of a bright season for
Davidson. on the diamond this year.
Candidates for the pitching position are
Paul Coble, Charlie Harris, Jack Jen-
kins (all three last year’s‘ lettermen),
Henry Cathey, Lefty Porter, Billy
Ravenel and George and Jack Summer-
ville. ‘Wingfield looked good behind the
plate, while “Woody” Burns and Tom
Corbin -both made bids for  firsthase
honors. Floyd Bumgarner, on second,
and Mackorell, at third, both
lettermen from last year’s team, showed
that their place on the team was well
earned,» Hank Loftin and Bill Quick
shared honors as shortstops. Teal Rog-
ers, Jim Morgan (both lettermen during
the “34 season), Johnny Partridge, and
Ed Armfield did good work in the out-
field. Others with ambitions to hold
down the job of catcher are Burns, John
Stewart and Jim Dixon.

The captain of this year’s team has
not yet been chosen, but he will be se-
lected in time to lead the Wildcat at-
tack upon the Michigan State nine in
their game here on Vriday, March 29,

Play First Game With Ohio
State Thursday

Carlyle Lewis, junior net ace, broke
through the lines with a surprising up-
set to gain the championship crown in
the annual fall tennis tournament which
was played on the local courts Satur-
day afternoon before an enthusiastic
gallery. Lewis came through by defeat-
ing the favored Tommy ‘Phifer, 6-2, 7-5,
6-8, 7-5.

His steady drives and high-powered
stroking proved to be too much for Phi-
fer, who played a defensive game
throughout. Lewis opened up the set
by steady and powerful drives which
seemed as if they were going to last
throughout the whole match, but Phifer
pulled from behind in the third set and
overtook his opponent for a few games,
but Carlyle fell back into his form and
took the’ final set 7-5, claiming No. 1
position on the tennis team for this
year.

From the twenty-one entries of the
tournament, six men won places on the
tennis team for this spring. These men
are Carlyle Lewis, Tommy Phifer, Dud-
ley Elvery, Martin Barnett, George
Hornbeck, and Jake Morrow.

Lewis drew a bye in the first round
and defeated Skip Brown in the second
by a score of 6-2, 6-3, In the third
he easily defeated Archie McFadyen,
6-0, 6-1" The next round was played
with Dudley Elvery, who was the seed-
ed No. 1 man, and Lewis met some op-
position but managed to win the match,
6-2, 10-8, 6-3. The finals were played
with Tommy Phifer with a score of
6-2, 7-5, 6-8, 7-5.

Phifer drew a bye in the first round
but met Jake Morrow in the second and
overtook him with ease, 6-4, 6-2. The
next match was played against Leonard
Woodward, whom he defeated 6-2, 6-0.
