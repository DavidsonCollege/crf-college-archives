A VISIT WITH HOMER

Walking into Davidson’s football office is an ex-
perience everyone should have. If for nothing else,
the sincerity which ebbs from head coach Homer
Smith and, in this case, assistants Dick Tomey and
Dave Fagg makes one want. to sit down and just ob-
serve the manner of these men. ;

When I walked in, these three were discussing
goal-line offenses. Without hesitation Homer almost
invited my opinion of the circles and lines on the
blackboard. It was a complicated play but his ex-
planation made it sure for a touchdown because it
was so strategically perfect. This is the modest gen-
ius of the men in “The New Look—Chapter Two”
in Davidson football.

Monday will begin Homer Smith's second spring
football practice. With a 3-4 record in his first year
here, he is regarded somewhere near the category of
the saviour of Davidson football. There aren’t any
“Homer” jokes. To many people, Homer Smith is a

distant, mysterious figure.
’ x

But Homer Smith has
ka

Davidson on his mind.
From football to Ves-
pers, he cares about
this school. He proudly
notes that every visit-
ing football prospect
this year has talked
with at least two pro-
fessors. A long-awaited
football recruiting bro-
chure features things
that any high school
junior, not just a foot-
ball player would want
to know about David-
son. Homer Smith is
the kind of guy you.
wish every interview
could be with. If you
have a question, you
will get an answer.

Everyone believes we
will -improve our 6-4
record. Most likely we
will, but the road to that goal will not be easy. Dav-
idson has only 18 lettered Wildcats, which means
freshmen and inexperienced squad members must
assume a greater role if this edition of the Richard-
son Field ramblers is to jell.

Of the backfield, Smith says, “They will all have
to be ready.” Steve Smith is gone, and the load falls
primarily to Bill Taylor, Johnny Walker and Pete
Glidewell. Smith is high on Glidewell’s receiving
abilities and he may find himself at flanker (No
more tweener back this year). A freshman who
must help is Mike Thornton.

In the defensive backfield where Renn Gruber
and Tommy Caldwell are the mainstays, someone
must fill the shoes of departed All-Conference Dave
Sprinkle. Caldwell, whose speed makes him a dan-
gerous runner, will play offensively too this fall
since probably less than forty players will reconvene
for football camp in September.

WEIGHT THE KEY

The hardest positions to fill will be the con-
tainer positions of All-Conference Pack Hindsley and
big Jim Rollins, and the interior offensive line posts.
Smith is high on four big freshmen linemen who
must play a vital part if Davidson is to be offensive-
ly potent this fall. The weight of Hank Strickland,
Sandy Brenneman, Joe Murphy and Jeff Pflugner
is important because
games like William and
Mary in which we were
sorely outweighed must
be less frequent. Center
Walter Greene will
have to anchor the of-
fensive line if it is to’
act experienced despite
the greenness it most
certainly will have.

Smith mentions three
Jettermen ‘whose per-
formances last year put
them in the spotlight

cooK

this year. Defensive
cornerback Tommy .
Dews is  Davidson’s

number one All Con-
ference nominee. Smith
describes him as “tre-
mendous, as conspicu-
ous as Pack Hindsley,
the greatest defensive
player in Davidson his-
tory.” ;
“We are very fortunate to have two experi-
enced quarterbacks, Jake Jacobsen and Jimmy
Poole. Their abilities differ, so when we substi-
tute one for the other, we don’t expect the same
job. Both are good executors and move the team
well,” says Homer. In addition to his signal-call-
ing duties, Jacobsen will work with the defensive
secondary.

THE SCHEDULE

Discussing the schedule, Smith noted, ‘“We want
to stretch ourselves. That’s why we are going in-
tersectional.” If this doesn’t make sense, consider
how William and Mary romped on us after colliding
with Navy the week before.

“Our schedule is planned to give the greatest
advantage toward winning the conference.” We
have conference games with GW, Furman, East
Carolina, El Cid and Richmond, plus games with
P.C., Wofford and Wittenburg. ; ;

Wittenburg is not too well known in this area,
but they are annually one of the Midwest's top small
college. teams. (Remember Bucknell?) We must
play them in Ohio in the future, but not in 1967.

The schedule is largely like last year’s. Gone
are VMI, W and M, Lafayette and Bucknell. But
East Carolina is another team with the horses and
they will be hard to beat. We have only four home

FOOTBALLERS AWAIT SPRING PRACTICE

FB Drills To Begin

Head . football coach Homer
Smith and his ‘““New Look"’ team
of assistants, Bobby Brown, Dick
Short, Dave Fagg and Dick
Tomey, will greet around 40 can-
didates Monday afternoon when
they launch spring football prac-
tice.

The drills, which will run for
five weeks, will culminate in an
open intrasquad scrimmage on
May 14. Smith and his staff
have been planning the practice
for several weeks with emphasis
on tailoring the ‘Cats offense to
the talents of members of this
year’s squad.

Eighteen lettermen are scat-
tered among the 40 out for prac-
tice. Ends Bill Rikard, Claude
Owen and Buddy Newsome will
form the offensive nucleus. New-
some will also see action on de

fensive. Lowell Bryan, Randy
Randolph and Kit Thompson are
returnees at tackle.

The offensive guards are two
positions where no candidate has
any substantial experience; but
at center sophomore Walter
Greene, a starter last year, will
return, and around him the olf.
fensive line will be developed.

The situation is much brighter
in the backfield. Junior quarter-
backs Jimmy Poole and Jake
Jacobsen were instrumental. in
the ‘Cats’ six victories last fall,
and they will give both depth and
experience to the signal-calling
slot.

Running backs who contribut-
ed much to last fall’s success-
ful season are junior Johnny
Walker and sophomores Bill
Taylor and Pete Glidewell.

To Regatta Win

The Davidson sailing team again routed
their competition, this time at The Citade)
Spring Invitational Regatta, to coast to their
third win against no losses for the spring series.

The races were held on Saturday, March
26, on the Ashley River in Charleston. Schools
entered in the regatta were The Citadel, the
University of South Carolina, the College of
Charleston, Old Dominion College and Dav-
idson.

eight firsts, one second and a disqualification.
