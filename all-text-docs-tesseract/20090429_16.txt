Baseball sweeps
UNC-G Spartans

The Davidson baseball team
won all three games they played
against UNC-Greensboro _ this
weekend at Wilson Field. The
Wildcats seemed to feed off the
stellar North Carolina weather and
the “spring frolics” atmosphere that
pervaded campus to put together a
great weekend performance.

Playing games on Friday, Satur-
day and Sunday, the Wildcats beat
UNC-G 5-4, 4-2, and 5-4 respec-
tively. The Wildcats have won four
straight, catapulting their SoCon
record above .500 to a respectable
11-10 mark. The win streak also
brings the team’s overall record to
17-21 on the season.

Mike Frongello ’11 was sensa-
tional in the series, garnering So-
Con Baseball Pitcher of the Week
for his performance in the games
from April 20-26. Frongello earned
two wins and logged 11 and 2/3 in-
nings of scoreless relief work over
the week and was an integral con-
tributor in their sweep of UNC-G.

In Friday’s game, Frongello’s
three shutout relief innings, com-
bined with Chase Fitzpatrick’s ’09
two home runs, propelled Davidson
to a 5-4 victory. Fitzpatrick went
2 for 4 with 3RBIs and two home
runs, one of them the game-winner
in the sixth inning. Fitzpatrick now
leads the team with 12 home runs
on the year. Danny Weis ’11 began
the game with a pop, belting a two-
run home run to right field in the
bottom of the first inning. Fitzpat-
rick’s pair of dingers was all Da-
vidson needed after that to hold on
to the 5-4 victory. Frongello’s three
shutout innings earned him the win
and Matt Webb ’09 came in and
mowed down UNC-G with a one-
two-three ninth to secure the save.

Davidson continued to live
by the long-ball on Saturday. The
Wildcats beat UNC-G 4-2, fueled
primarily by Drew Gadaire’s °12
three-run home run in the eighth
inning. Chris Lamb ’12 gave Da-
vidson a great chance to win with
his pitching performance. Lamb
struck out eight over 5 and 1/3
innings while surrendering only
two unearmed runs. Frongello and
Webb combined again to finish off
the Spartan’s with three and 2/3 in-
nings of yet-again scoreless relief.

Mike Frongello "11 earned
Southern Conference Pitcher
of the Week honors after
tossing 8 2/3 shutout innings
against UNCG.

Webb came on in the ninth to close
the game. After giving up a lead-off
single, he struck out the next three
UNC-G hitters to end the game.

‘Danny Weiss continued to swing

a great bat in the game, going a
perfect 3-3 with one run and Seth
Freeman °12 went 2-4; they were
the only two Davidson players who
provided a multi-hit performance
on Saturday.

Sunday, the Wildcats demon-
strated some timely hitting, coming
back from a 3-1 deficit to start the
bottom of the seventh to eventually
win 5-4 in an impressive 11th in-
ning rally. Graham Chapman ’09
tied the score in the seventh with
his two-run home run. Brett Shore
’09 began the 11th inning rally with
a single to the left, going to 3-5 on
the day. Chapman then popped up
to the catcher and Zach Kayne ’09
followed up with a walk after Shore
advanced to second on a wild pitch.
Kayne then moved to second and
into scoring position with Drew
Gadaire’s fielder’s choice that
eliminated Shore at third. With the
score tied at three and two on and
two-out Weiss sent his third hit of
the day in front of the center fielder
to score Kayne and win the game
for the Wildcats.

Frongello was the only David-
son pitcher not to give up a mn,
pitching three innings of one-hit
baseball. It was Frongello’s third

Both the women’s and men’s
track teams posted solid perfor-
mances at the SoCon outdoor
championships last weekend, dom-
inating the long-distance events in
Statesboro, GA. The men brought
home a fifth-place finish while the
women earned the ninth spot in a
competitive field.

Both teams boasted first-place
finishers in the 10,000 meters, the
longest race in outdoor track. Dan-
ielle Ruggieri ’11 took the gold
with a time of 37:45.13, clearing
her nearest competitor by over 18
seconds. Emily King °1] crossed
the line in sixth for her scoring con-
tribution to the Wildcats.

Lance Harden ’09 also cleaned
out his championship heat with
a personal best performance of
31:27.20. Behind him, Ryan Hop-
kins *12 and Greg Marcil *11
snatched the fourth and fifth spots,
respectively, giving the men’s team
a further scoring boost.

In the 5K, Harden again placed
highest for the ’Cats, taking the
conference silver, while Charlie

Virginia Berry 10 was named first team All- Southern Conference _
for her play at No. 2 singles for the Wildcats this season.

Harden, Ruggieri shine
at SoCon Championships

rounded off the team’s domina-
tion of the heat with third and sixth
place finish, respectively. Ruggieri
provided the women’s squad sup-
port in the race as well, scoring
points from fourth place with a
time of 18:09.38.

The 1500 meter race also wit-
nessed another Davidson runner in
the scoring column, as Alex Hoyt
’09 grabbed a fourth-place finish.
Hoyt was plagued by ankle prob-
lems earlier in the year, and despite
the challenges, concluded his col-
legiate career with a solid sub-four
time of 3:57.21

Strong showings in the field
events provided the final scoring

for the teams’ resumes. Kittery .

Neale ’09 launched a discus throw
of 39.39 meters to earn her the
fourth-place position.

Neale also placed tenth in the
shot put and ninth in the javelin
events. Her classmate Will Funder-
burg ’09 found a fifth-place finish
in the shot put, firing his best shot
put throw of the season at 14.68
meters. He also took eighth in the
discus throw.

With the performances of Rug-
gieri, King and Neale, the women’s

team totaled 23 points over the

weekend. Their ninth-place show- -
ing put them just four points behind
the Citadel, showing positive signs
for upward mobility in the coming
years.

The women’s team will look for
its top finishers this year to carry
the torch. While the ’Cats will miss
the competitiveness of sprinters
Kim Colley 09 and Bea Bush ’09
and triple jumper Kennesia Martin
’09, they will gain an edge from
Sarah Cline ’11, who grabbed the
11th spot in the 1500 this year. Lau-
ren Childs ’11 hung in the middle
of the pack during the 3000-meter
steeplechase, picking up ninth, and
is positioned for a scoring spot in
the future.

The men’s team notched an even
higher overall score at the SoCon
Championships, with 63 points.
Next year, rivals Citadel and Sam-
ford will be ripe for the picking, as
they led the ’Cats by only 3.5 and 7
points, respectively.

Leading the future charge
will be Taylor Martin *12, whose
51.48-second performance in the
400 garnered him an eighth-place
finish in his first conference cham-
