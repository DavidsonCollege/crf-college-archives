The prevailing thoughts throughout the
banquet have already been intimated in the
exchange of congratulations, One other
particular idea was predominant throughout
the entire evening though, and that was in
reference to the spirit of Davidson College,
and what it means to men. This was empha-
sized, not primarily from the standpoint of
what strength it gives to the team, nor the

Florida Men Will
Ride Special Car

The Florida Club held a meeting on the
evening of December oth in Phi Hall to
discuss the possibility of arranging to
get an extra Pullman to be exclusively
reserved for Davidson men going as far
south as Jacksonville to spend the holi-
days. Frank Alford, president of the
club, presided.

Through the efforts of M. A.
nathy, an extra Pullman has been ar-
ranged on the Southern Railway. This
car will pass through Davidson at 4:30
p. m., on December 22nd, and will go
through to Jacksonville, arriving there at
8:00 a. m. on December 23rd. This spe-
cial arrangement makes it very conven-
ient for those who are to patronize the
extra Pullman, in that it eliminates any
change of trains.

After the discussion, refreshments con-
sisting of sandwiches, soft drinks, ice
cream and cake were served. Cigars and
cigarettes were also furnished.

Sixteen members of the club were pres-
ent at this meeting, and much enthu-
siasm over the arrangements made was
manifest.

spirit upon the athletic field, but that in every
activity at college, in the class room, on the
campus, in all phases of college life, there
was a different kind of atmosphere not al-
Ways present on other campuses.

Furthermore, one of the Pavidson alumni
stated that he had found that the spirit of
determined doggedness and indomitable cour-
age that he had obtained on the campus was
proving of lasting henefit to him in the busi-
ness world, and when disappointments were
staring him in the face, that his training at
Davidson oftentimes saved him and spurred
him on to work again.

During the course of the evening an invi-
tation was formally extended to every man
on the Davidson team who graduated this
year to return to the banquet which that
alumni association is planning to give at the
close of next season. The affair Saturday
night was the second time that a football
team had been entertained, the Gaston asso-
ciation, however, acting as host to a third
banquet, when in 1924 they entertained the
baseball nine.

Just at the close of the banquet Manager
Regen announced that Lucien Wells would
captain the Wildcats in the season of 1926
as a result of the election that morning. Up
until that time the outcome of the election
was unknown to any of the players.

At the conclusion officers of that associa-
tion were unanimously elected as follows:
President, Fred L. Smyre, of Gastonio; vice-
president, C. M. Robinson, of Lowell, and
secretary-treasurer, Hugh Query, of Gas-
tonia,

The following letter men were present: ’

Captain Black, Captain-elect Wells, Hendrix,
Dick Grey, McComb, Harrison, Nisbet, Leg-

gette, Vance, Laird, Anderson, Baker, Mc-}

Connell, Pinkney, Bohannon, Arrowood, Jim
Grey, Melton, Ritchie, and Manager Regen.

Other Davidson guests were Monk Young-
er, Tex Tilson, Dr. J. M. Douglas, Dr. J.
M. McConnell, Mr. F. L. Jackson, and
Ernest Milton.

‘Rev. J. F. Ligon Delivers Inspiring
Talks on Abraham and
Prodigal Son

Rev. J. F. Ligoi¥of the Tenth Avenue
Presbyterian Church of Charlotte gave a
very helpful talk at “Y” service Sunday
night in Shearer hall.

The speaker chose two texts for his
discussion, one from the eleventh chapter
of Hebrews and one from the fifteenth
chapter of Luke. They were: “not know-
ing whither he went and “and took his
journey into a far country.” The first
has to do with Abraham leaving the
home of his fathers and seeking a new
home for his family; the second tells of

the prodigal son leaving his father’s
home.
The burden of Mr. Ligon'’s remarks

Was a contrast of the two men, Abraham
and the prodigal son. The two men were
,alike in that they were both young but
they were different in that Abraham was
religious and the prodigal was worldly
inclined, The life was char-
by seriousness of mind and
steadfastness of nature whereas flippanecy
and carelessness characterized the lat-
ter. In that neither knew where he was
going they were similar but that one was
secking a better place and environment
and the other was leaving a good en-
vironment and secking a worse place,
there is a marked contrast. God is tak-
ing Abraham from a sinful city to a place
to carry out his purpose and the prodigal
is going to a place to satisfy his Passions.
Both were impelled by a preat inner
urge; the call ofthe far country and ad-
venture was common to both. Abraham
Was conservative, religious, cautious and
self-controlled,

The prodigal was rest-

different motives prompted
{them: Abraham was guided by God; the
prodigal is guided by his own lusty am-

hitions.

Radically

Their experiences were similar to that
they both reecived the things for which
they set out to get, but they greatly con-
trast in that one found riches, peace, hap
piness and a God, while the other found
human degradation, shame and loss of
wealth, moral power and popularity.

After this vivid picture and contrast of
the two men, the speaker drew the very
apt conclusion that it is each individual's
responsibility to choose his way in life—
one of two ways—the God directed life
or hte self directed life.

The first way leads to peace, happiness
and eternal life; the scéond leads to dis-
‘appointment, humiliation, and disaster.

YOUNG PEOPLE'S
CONFERENCE
IN ATLANTA

During the Christmas holidays from
December 29th through 31st there will be
be held in Atlanta a conference for the

| young people of the Southern Presbyte-
rian Church, It is estimated that there
| will be over a thousand young people
gathered for the purpose of inspiration
and study. A number of prominent
speakers have been secured among whom
are Dr. W. T. Thompson, Dr. Charles
Pratt, Dr. Gillespie, Dr. B. R. Lacy, Dr.
Charles Goodell of New York and Dr.
Egbert W. Smith. The conference bids
fair to be one ofthe best ever held in the
South.
Several

ofthe Davidson students are
| planning to attend the meeting. There
_will be some reduction in the railroad
rates which will prove beneficial to those
coming a distance. A small registration
fee is charged but the convention will
| prove inexpensive as the delegates are to
be entertained inthe homes of Atlanta.
| Anyone dsiring mor information can ob-
tain it by seeing any member ofthe Y. |
| Cabinet.
