We were interested
to note that the last is-
sue of The Davidsonian
contained a letter to
the editor concerning
the situation on the in-
interfraternity field as
to the newly-substituted
‘‘tag’’ game. The writ-
er expressed one of the
needs of the game very
well, and indeed it is
the most important need
and one which never
should have arisen.
However when some-
thing new is presented,
it always takes time,

By DICK LILES

scmetimes several years as in this case, and the kinks arising in
this sort of change would be numerous and are going to keep
popping up for some time.

OLD GAME WAS NEVER FREE FROM BICKERING
Even through last year, the touch game was not clear to
all and numerous times throughout the year Coach Whittle was
asked to interpret the rules as he saw them, and sometimes these
forgotten or discarded rules were completely foreign to the
general concensus ot knowledge of players and sports managers.

“Ground rules” as it were, were sometimes formu-
lated by the captains of opposing teams before the
game. Flying blocks and hard “‘touching’’ were fre-
quently ignored by “pick-up” officials. Just as our
present tag, it was a loosely-played, hap-hazard sort
of game with the idea to get by with as much as you
could without getting an infrequent penalty. As you
know. this sort of looseness led to numerous injuries
and even more-numerous rows and misunderstandings.

And so the sports managers got together and with a little
persuasion from school officials, the school physician. and Coach
Whittle decided it was best to abandon the sport. They voted
for the “tag” type of game which is popular and has been used
for a number of years at Carolina, Wake Forest, and Duke. It
has been working there for quite a long time, why shouldn't
it work here?.

To those of us who were used to the rough and
tumble touch football, looking-on to the new game ap-
peared somewhat boresome and lacked the spirit of
the old game. It is true, at least personally, that taking
the blocking and roughness out of interfraternity foot-
ball, also took the spirit and fight and they seem to
be lacking from both the spectator and player view-
points.

Taking these ‘‘vital” elements out of the game is like
outlawing tackle in the Southern Conference. But something
lad to be done about the namerous injuries of last season and
so we have our new touch game.

INTERFRATERNITY ATHLETICS ARE A MUST

Nobody will deny that interfraternity athletics tend to
foster fraternity spirit, promote good will among the fraternities,
and are downright healthful to the participants. It is with this
in mind, that we should get behind the movement to promote
tag football and lean toward better and clearer rules of the
game and better management of the sport. The sports managers
can demand clearer interpretation and the frats can help uphold
them.

RICHMOND IS LAST OF EASY ONES

After missing all but one of their easiest rivals in the win
column, the Wildcats embarked on their trip to Richmond this
morning to meet their last real “easy” match of the season.
The University of Richmond has never been too formidable on
the football front although they have the money and con-
sequently, the material. The Cats pinned their ears back last
year, but that was for the licking they had given us on Home-

coming year before last.
The Machine has seen unusually good success in
the north-bounding state, having garnered their only
win from VPI by a 32-20 score. Again they have a
Homecoming defeat staring down their backs. Last
week's win by our “cousin's” from the South was par-
ticularly stunning to all who witnessed the fray gnd

to the players and coaches.

The defensive line played a game that was without re-
proach from any source. Those boys could have given any team
a fit through the line.

Kappa Alpha Pacing

Tag Football Loop
With Four Triumphs

After only one week of inter-
mural football, the number of un-
defeated teams has already been
narrowed down to one, the KA‘s.
They, alone, possess a 4-0 record:
their nearest competition coming
from the Pi Kapps and Sigma Chi’s
who possess 3-1 records. So far
it has been the passing of T. W.
Aldred and the receiving of
“Pappy” Fowle that has kept the
KA's on top of the league. How-
ever, they have yet to tangle with
the two runner-up teams, so the
coming weeks should furnish some
interesting games among these
teams.

Despite the fact that this gasne
is being played for the first time
here at Davidson, the officiating
and playing of the games has been
on a very high level. It’s plenty
hard to get out and try to officiate
a game that you have never seen
played before, much less partici-
pated in yourself, but that is just
what the referees have been doing,
and doing in a very excellent man-
ner.

One interesting aspect of the
games so far has been the relative-
ly low scores run up by the teams.
Before the season started, estimates
ran into the fifty’s and -sixty’s’ as
to the final scores of the games.
However, in the actual playing of
the games, the scores have been
much less. Despite the fact that
teams can use unlimited passing,
the highest score yet 10 be run up
was 31 points by the SPE's against
the Phi Delts. Maybe after the
season progresses a little farther
the teams will become more fa-
miliar with the game and higher
scores will result, but as yet this
hasn’t taken place.

The results of this week's games
are as follows:

Baird Smiles On
Early Cage Work

By BO TYNES

With the basketball season just around the corner, once
again the pounding of the hardwoods can be heard around the
Johnston Gymnasium. Both the hardened troupers and fresh-
man hopefuls have been working out under the guidance of
Coach Boyd Baird since Tuesday afternoon. For the first week

only, the Freshmen have worked
out at night, while the upperciass-
men meet in the afternoon sessions.
Because of the new conference
raling, allowing freshmen to par-
ticipate in vafsity comretition, a
“B" team will replace the fresh-
man club.

Although several freshmen
have looked exceptionally well,
it would be difficult to place a
finger on any outstanding
prospects at this carly date.
As a whole, Coach Baird seems
to be very ‘well pleased with
the Freshman turnout.

In the varsity ranks, the Cats
are fortunate in having a large
group returning from last year's
varsity, plus a few others moving
up from the ‘51 freshman squad.
Lost by graduation were Co-Cap-
tains Tommy Haller and “Dutch”
Hengeveld, Two others who were
counted on for a lot of action this
season, did not return, were Bill
Proctor and Bob Graham. Proctor,
a transfer student, had been work-
ing in nicely at center, but was just

recently drafted. Returning fo the
forward posts will be team Captain
Bill Brooks, Bob Turk, and T. C.
Coleman.

The versatile Coleman, who
can be counted on to double
at either center or forward, had
to drop out at mid-season last
year because of an injured
knee. Mac McLean and Don
Lazenby will probably be found
at the guards, At the present
time Don is out with a sprained
ankle. Joe Dudley and George
Melton, a sophomore up from
the frosh team, will be scrap-
ping it out for the center post,
with Bill Glidwell not to be
thought lightly of for the same
position. This combination:
should show a marked improve-
ment over last year’s team;
7 wins as against 19 defeats.

The '51-'52 hoopstets will play
a tough 2l-game schedule, .start-
ing off against N, C. State on
December 4, at the Johnston Gym.

Loss of Ruth Only Crowning Blow}

To Crowell Who Expects The Worst

When 145-pound Johnny Grey was helped off the field
after a collision with 400-pounds of rugged beef. a spectator
commented, ‘I went all through high school ball with Johnny
and this is the first time I've ever seen him burt.”

The point is: Johnny Grey had
never been to Davidson before.

While the injury potential is
hardly, as bad as all that, one would
have a tough case proving other-
wise to Crowell Little.

When the season kicked off
the Wildcat mentor had as
fine a club as had been assem-
bled here in some years. But
before the first game, things
began to happen. Jim Hardy,
booked for a starter at guard,
had to withdraw from school
with an illness. Another frosh,
big and oh—so promising Pete
Petersen was lifted from a sure
first string job when his knee
was twisted under him in a
pile-up.

The minor injuries continued,
and then The Citadel struck, A. C,
Gregg, seemingly off to his finest

lyear, broke his leg in the second

quarter. The third period saw No.

lined for the season with a twisted
knee. Two more starters shelved

WILDCAT OF THE WEEK -~ Jerry Kiser

The final score stood at 14-12
Presbyterian, but from the looks
of some of the statistics this was
hard to believe. It seemed the Wild-
cats had allowed Coach Lonnie
McMillan’s Blue Hose only 28 yards
rushing in a whole ball game last
Saturday, while racking up 264
themselves.

One of the main reasons that the
Hose hadn't been able to crack
the Wildcat front wall was a bar-
rel-shaped individual from Shelby,
who made like a piece of granite
whenever P.C. had the ball. Coach
McMillan admitted that he hadn't
thought much of his chances as
far as his team’s running attack
was concerned, but when Jerry
Kiser made his way onto Richard-
son Fiéld last Saturday afternoon
his 5’ 9”, 235-pound frame causing
minor earth tremors as he took
calisthenics, the P.C. club evident-
ly took a turn fof the worse and

was D.C./P.C.

Although he made only three un-
assisted tackles (according to an
unofficial tabulation), Jerry was the
mainstay of a line which included
such defensive specialists as Bil!
Freeman, Charlie Rankin, Walter
Oakes, all of whom were giving
an excellent account of themselves.
But for genial Jerry it was one
of the best games of his college
career.

Kiser, who is alternate captain
of the Wildcat eleven, is used to
winning honors on the gridiron.
In his senior year at Shelby High,
Jerry won all state honors and
played in the Shrine Bowl classic at
Charlotte. He was also captain of
the Shelby eleven in his senior year,
capping a four-year stint with the
repsters,

faying his fourth year for the
Wildcats, Jerry will have nothing
to regret if he keeps up his present
brand of play.

Ailing Jack Ruth

Doubtful

Starter

By BILL BRADFORD

With the homecoming defeat of 1951 behind them, the
Wildcats enter into the last contest in which they find them-
selves rated even with their opponent. The Richmond game Sat-
urday marks the first of three tough ones up in Virginia, and
it will be a rough one, you can be sure.

Richmond boasts a freshman- |

starred team which shows promise
af being a power in the Southern
Conference if it is to live up to the
words of Coach Merrick, the men-
tor of the Richmond Spiders. With
virtually, three-fourths of the team,
and nine out of the starting eleven
Freshmen, it is somewhat of an in-
experienced combination, to say the
least. Merrick predicted five wins
this season but so far the team has
not shown up too well. They have
lost three out of the four games
played. Wake Forest plastered them
by a margin. of 56-6 while West
Virginia trimmed them 24-6. Their
lone win comes from Hampton-
Sydney who they downed 13-7.

The Spiders run from the
regular T and have the heaviest
team to be faced all season.
The overall average is 190 ibs.
With a hard running Sloblo-
vian in the full-back spot,
named Zepucich, and two fast
halfbacks. Johns and Farris,
Richmond has a well-rounded
backfield. The quarterback spot
is held down by a couple of
passers, Tyler and Bauder.

The Wildcats: have been woefully
lacking in pass defense as the
Stands noticed last week and it is
upon this weakness and downfield
tackling that Little has been work-
ing on all week. Any moving the
Spiders do will almost have to be
through the air as it will take
some heavy going before they pene-
trate the tough Wildcat defensive

The Wildcats constantly plagued
with injuries have again suffered
a rough jolt in the form of in-

it is. still doubtful) whether Ruth
will be able to pilot the intricate
T through the whole game. Young
John Accher from Franklin, N. C.,

EAA will be the man called on if such
Hlis the case. Archer is

an adept
passer and should be the man for
the job, except for his lack of ex-
perience, but in all probability: it

will be upom his shoulders that the
responsibility ‘of runtiing the team

This game will also mark the
return of some other injured
performers, Arnold Whisnant
