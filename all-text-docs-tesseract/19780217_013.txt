Gridders see experience as the key

A guarded but pervading
optimism surfaces when talk
with the Davidson coaching
staff shifts to the upcoming
football season.

Coach Dave Roberts ex-
plains, ‘‘I think this year for the
first time we’ve got about 20
seniors and we’re going to be
pretty good. Leadership is su-
per. All of the seniors are
getting involved in these classes
we’re running in the off-sea-
son.”

Roberts says of the classes:
‘they’re physical education
classes— anybody can get into
them. We encourage the foot-
ball players to jump in there.

“It kind of goes with the
seniors each year. This year
they’ve jumped right in and
everybody else has jumped in
behind, and now they’re work-
ing like crazy —it’s contagious!
Now everybody is pretty excit-
ed about what’s about to hap-
pen.”

Roberts pointed out that
“through about the sixth game

of the season, we as coaches
find out we had some pretty
good players here—some very
good players at certain posi-
tions.

“We don’t have the time to
spend on the practice field or in
meetings that some of our
opponents do, so we can’t get as
refined. But we don’t want to.

“We've got super good play-
ers. We want to go back to the
very basic fundamentals and
just get super good at the basic
parts so we can line up and we
don’t have to be tricky to beat
somebody.

Although this year’s recruit-
ing effort is expected to be
successful, it is not a factor in
the optimism about the up-
coming season.

Roberts illustrates the situa-
tion facing a freshman, ‘‘a
freshman who comes in here in
athletics is really gung ho

Rout Hampden-Sydney

Wrestlers win first

By JEFF HARRIS

The Davidson wrestling team
traveled north this past week-
end in search of theif first
victory of the season. The team
wrestled Washington and Lee
Friday evening and Hampden-
Sydney Saturday afternoon.

In the ‘match against Wash-
ington and Lee, Pat McKinsey,
in the 134 Ibs. class, pinned his
opponent with .e well-executed
lateral drop in the second
period. Davidson was forced to
forfeit the 142 lbs. class due to a
knee injury to Glenn Ballard
earlier in the week.

Pat Dulaney, who was rest-
ing from the flu did not wrestle
against Washington“and ‘Lee,
planning instead to conserve his
strength for the match against
Hampden-Sydney.

Dulaney was replaced in the
150 lbs. class by freshman, Bill
Allen, who lost a decision to his
W&L opponent.

Anthony Sanfilippo, Scott
Phillips and Rob King won by
decisions in the 167 lbs., 177
lbs. and heavyweight classes.

However, the absence of con-
sistent winners, Ballard and
Dulany and W&L wins in the
five other classes gave Wash-
ington and Lee the victory by a
score of 33-18.

Entering their match against
Hampden-Sydney Davidson
was eager for victory and the
results of the match were im-
pressive.

The Cats gave up only six
points and those were the result
of a forfeit by Davidson in the

118 lbs. class. Every other
Davidson wrestler won his
match.

Rich Reich pinned his oppo-
nent in one minute to win the
126 Ibs. class, which was the
quickest pin of the season for
any Davidson wrestler.

McKinsey won his second
match of the weekend with a
10-5 victory in the 134 lbs.
class.

Allen moved down to the 142
lbs. class to fill the void left by
the injured Ballard and won his
match by a score of 10-5 to take
his first win in collegiate compe-
tition.

Dulany, rested after his bout
with the flu, won the 150 lbs.
class by a score of 10-2, while
Pete Johnson won the 158 lbs.
class by forfeit.

Sanfilippo, in the 167 lbs.
class, dominated his opponent
to win 12-4. It was his third
victory in a row.

Phillips and King in the 177
lbs. and heavyweight classes
both won by pins and Mike
Garfinkle won the 190 lbs. class
by forfeit.

It was an important victory
for the wrestling team. Hope-
fully the Cats can continue their
winning ways in the two re-
maining matches against Fur-
man and VMI.

When questioned about their
hopes for the Southern Confer-
ence Championship tourna-
ment, Ballard replied, ‘“‘no one
is looking for us to do anything,
so we have nothing to lose and
everything to win. We have
some people who should win at
the tournament.”’

field for maybe the first ‘three
weeks of the classes moves up.
Then the papers become due
and his progress on the football
field just goes right down.

“So we prefer not to have to
play a freshman, because right-
fully so, they’re worrying a-
bout, ‘Hey, I’m an A student
coming out of high school and
now I’ve got a C or a C-plus.
I’m doing the best I can so why
shouldn’t I get an A?

“So they’re struggling with
the academics and football is
way out in left field somewhere,
which we understand until they
put it together.”’

Thus in regards to the up-
coming season, Roberts is not,
with the exception of the kick-
ing department, counting on

any immediate help from the
incoming freshmen.

Roberts summed up his senti-
ments, ‘‘we’re counting on a
very good season. We’re look-
ing forward to it.

Our seniors have worked very
hard. They deserve something
very good and that’s what we’re
aiming for, to send them out
with a very good taste in their

Swimmers eye S.C. Tourney

The Wildcat Tankers finished
strong this past weekend with

_dual meet wins over Emory and

College of Charleston. The Cat
swimmers ended their regular
season witha 10-5 record.

The team now moves on the
Lexington, Va., and the South-
ern Conference championships
which start today and will run
through Saturday.

Highlighting these two meets
was the performance of Jona-
than Washburn. Washburn set
a new school record in the 200
freestyle on Friday against
Emory. Washburn also teamed
with Tom Spangler (back-
stroke), Mark Tommerdahl
(butterfly), and Ray Craven
(freestyle) as the wiped out the
existing school record for the
400 yard medley relay.

Washburn swam a strong
breaststroke leg for the relay.
His time or ‘‘split’”’ from the
medley relay showed that he
was well under the school record
for the 100 breaststroke. How-
ever, in order to set the record
he would have to swim the 100
yard breaststroke in individual
competition and not with the
medley relay.

Washburn got his chance the
next mornig against the College
of Charleston who requested
that a 100 yard breaststroke be
swum rather than the standard
200 yard breaststroke. The
reason for the.request was that
the College of Charleston hoped
to qualify one of its swimmers
for the nationals in the 100 yard
breast and hoped that its swim-
mer would be able to get under
the qualifying time.

The race turned out to be all
Washburn, however, as he led
from start to finish and did
establish a new school record.
That gave Washburn three
records for his weekend’s work.

Washburn and the team are
not finished yet with the school

records. Many records should
fall in the three day conference
championship.

The swimmers will be ‘‘shav-
ing down” for this meet and this
factor will cut times considerab-
ly. The absence of hair on the
legs and arms and sometimes
the chest (Marshall Brown)
decreases the friction that the
swimmer encounters as he
strokes through the water.
Most of the team will also wear
bathing caps as anothef. way to
negate frictinal forces between
water and swimmer.

Besides school records which’

will be broken, there is the
distinct possibility that a couple
of Davidson swimmers could
break Conference records. Tom-
merdahl returns to defend his
200 butterfly championship and
record of last year. He will face
a strong field, most of whom he
has already competed against
over the regular season, Wash-
burn also has the potential to
break some records and win
some events.

Marshall and.Appalachian
are to be favored, but Davidson
will challenge for third against
the other_teams.
