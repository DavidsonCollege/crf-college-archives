CUNNINGHAM REVEALS
POLICY OF COLLEGE
TOWARD WAR—

In this editorial we wish to print the
speech to the student body given in chapel
Monday by Dr. John R. Cunningham, presi-
dent ot the college:

“The world situation today is exceed-
ingly tense, and for our nation, grows hourly
more critical War has been declared
against us and betore the day is done lL
apsume we shall have returned the compli-
ment. Actual hostilities are in process.
These are times when young men are espe-
cially involved. They are unsettled times
for you. | am sympathetic with your posi-
tion and with your frame of mind. 1| was,
myself; a senior in Theological Seminary
in 1917, when War was declared by our
nation, I know something of the inner
struggles through which you must pass.

“I wish to commend the attitude you
have taken in this regard previously.
As I have talked with the heads of other
colleges and universities I find that
your attitudes have been shared by
the responsible students in other parts
of the country: Youwhave shown a good
poise and an ability to be philosophical
about the matter.

“I wish to express a word of caution to-
day against panic and hysteria at this time.
It is possible that sonie few students may
feel that they are called to turn aside from
their preparation and hasten into the mili-
tary. service of the country. My prediction
is that there is plenty of time yet for that
service. The word which I wish to stress,
particularly to you today is that you are
now engaged in a fundamental defense
task. You must beware that you do not
throw away an opportunity which has been
denied approximately 97 per cent of young
men—those who do not get to college. We
must, look further than winning a war, Win-
ning the peace is going to be evén more
important.’ It is going to take conse-
crated. gray matter and Christian spirit to do
that job. The man who is wisely and con-
§cientiously preparing himself in the field
of Christian Education is rendering, cer-
tainly, a far greater service to his nation and
to the future than he can now know. No
college man, I trust, asking for defer-
ment i but.

because—he—is—a—collece

man,

rather because of the need of trained men
during and after this emergency.

“The College expects to be loyal to
our Government in this emergency.
it will attempt also to be loyal to your
best interests. I am advising that you

counsel with Mr. Hengeveld, our Reg-
istrar, in regard to technicalities, and
that you allow both Mr. Hengeveld and
me _to do what we can to see that your
draft boards are acquainted with all
relevant consitlerations. _ Meanwhile,
we will be wise if we keep our feet on
the ground, if we keep our spirits
steady, and do our day’s work as best
we can, and, above all, obey the in-
junction of Dr. Richards in the sermon
last evening when he counseled us,
“Keep God at the center of your lives.”
If Davidson’s traditions and ideals are
correct, and if they were ever called
into actual testing, then it seems to me
vé are face to face’ with situations
which demand their assertion. Let us
conduct ‘ourselves in these days in a
way ultimately to win the approval not
only of our Government, but of Him
“who sittest on His throne in the heavens

& and whose Kingdom ruleth over all.

Letter To The Editor

From the Manager of Carolinas

Bowl Game
Mr. Tony Darby,
Editor The Davidsonian,
Dear Tony:

¥,

Time heals all wounds but association
and friendship are far better and quicker.
Taking a few memories fromthe Carolinas’
All-Star game at Greenville and the im-
pressive banquet one is able to see and
learn many things.

Here at Davidson one is apt to think in
a down-trodden way of the boys from other
schools. Boys from one squad have no
grudge against the boys but rather the
desire Many hard feelings are

to. win,

caused between. schools by a few agitators ~

who spread the word of how one team is
dirty, how they hate us and if we don’t
kill a few at the next game we will be
ruined.

At the game we learned that Wake
forest players aren’t big and dumb, State
boys aren’t farmers, Carolina boys aren’t
play-boys, and the Little Six isn‘t a push-
over for other schools, Rather one is brought
to realize that all the boys are clean-cut,
straight-thinking young men who will take
their stand in the world along with the
next fellow, who is going to be you and I,
With all of the boys playing and blocking
together from the various schools, room-
ing with each other and close associations,

it was evident that the above is true in, |

every respect.

These boys play for the honor of their
respective schools and like to win as well
as the next fellow, but in a fair and sports-
manlike way. Our school should realize
this and the student body recognize it. In
a few years all-of these hoys-wilt beside
hy side in defense of America. A lot better
feeling between schools could be brought
about if the good in others could be seen
instead of the imaginary bad. It is up to
every Davidson man to realize this and not
be critical of other schools. Every school
has it’s black sheep and these ate usually
the ones who edge on hard feeling between
truly great institutions. There is a great
difference between this and school spirit
and we should distinguish between. the
two in an effort to better relations be-
tween the various schools.

Since the All-Star game gave the boys
a chance to really know the next fellow
maybe it would not be a bad idea for all-
star games in every sport. Surely a fine
chante ‘to recognize men in the making.
Such—close—companionship. tends to make
stronger men, better schools, greater char-
acter and a true school spirit. Greenville
has done one thing above all else—It has
made twenty-three ‘N. C. football players
see the good in one another and know
that Carolina has some of the finest college
men in the country. Just look around and
you will soon agree with me and you don’t
have to look far or long.

VOS.

With The Rains Especially—
mr. tony darby
editor, the davidsonian,
dear tony,

frankly i’m not using capitals just to
attract attention, and what i haye to say

needs—to-attract-some attention from the

proper authorities. the some four hun-
dred sudents who walk behind chambers
down by the old gym use that path more
than most of the paved walks and I’m ad-
vocating a little pavement slung along here
to keep us from slinging mud at our friends.
since i’m a senior myself i’m tdo selfish to
wait on our senior gift fund,

yours for a better davidson,

selfish senior

And If You're Reading
Everything—

Although the phrase may seem a little
overworked, The Davidsonian wishes .the
student body, faculty and. other readers
a very merry Christmas and a happy New
Year, Duties this week are here listed:

THE NIGHT OF THE SIXTEENTH

‘Twas the night of the sixteenth, and all through the college

Not even a Phi Bete was thirsting for knowledge;

Their texts were all stacked on the tables with care,

In hopes that for Wednesday they needn't prepare;
And I, in my bed after Gangbusters’ thriller,

Had just settled down for a bit of Glenn Miller
When out in the hall there arose such a clatter,

I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.

The unruly Frosh, in the midst of the night,
With buckets and: water had started to fight.
Away to the door I flew with a howl,

Stutfed bottom and sides with

Roommate’s clean towel.

Impatient and angry, I crawled back in bed

As Visions of homicide danced through iny head.
By a quarter of twelve the last shot had been fired,
For even the Freshmen sometimes get tired,
Ignoring the water that inward did seep,

1 yanked up the covers, and was shortly asleep.

Too soon was [ snatched from this Subconcious state

By the clock on the desk that said quarter-past-eight.
My cuts were all taken, alack and alas—

I had just ten minutes to make it to class!
As Freshmen involved in a Shirt-tail will run,

So went I to class like the shot from a gun.

1 entered the door and was settling down,

When into the room came the prof with a bound.

His tone told mé“soon I had n6thing to lose

By enjoying the usual first-period snooze.

In this tashion the time did most rapidly vanish,

And, ere 1 could think, | was headed for Spanish.
“Just Chapel and English!" b breathed with a sigh,

“Then classes and textbooks and studies—goodbye !’”
The English protessor—a jolly old elf,

I laughed when I saw him in spite of myself.

A wink of his eye and a twist of his head
Soon gave us to know we had nothing to dread.
He spoke not_a_word, but started to work

And wrote on the board; then turned with a jerk,
Put his hand on his desk, the rollbook to close,

And, giving a nod, from his chair he arose.

And T heard him exclaim as we hurried away,
“Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good day!”

SWAMP WATER

se et

Walter Brennan, Walter Huston,
Anne Baxter, Dana Andrews, Vir-
ginia Gilmore, John Carradine, and
Mary Howard.

Vereen Bell’s saga of the life
and loves of the simple people liv-
ing near Georgia’s great Okefen-
okee Swamp has finally been pro:
duced. Of par-
ticular interest
to all Davidson
Men is the fact
that the author
is himself a Da-
yidson man, hav-
ing graduated
about ten years
ago.

To quote from

Legerton a review of the
production appearing in Time
magazine “With a few reefs

in the story slack, Twentieth Cen-
‘tury-Fox’s ‘Swamp Water Water’
might have rated as one of the
year’s Best Ten.” The review goes
on to say that the director, Jean
Renoir, has achieved a combina-
tion of overall good acting and at-
mosperic authenticity that should
recommend it to anyone who doesn’t
gauge his screen entertainment by
the size of the player names which
shine nightly from the marquees.

This isa story of the last, track-
less, Okenfenokee Swamp, and the
simple existence lead by the people
who live on the edge of its black,
mysterious waters, The plot is con-
cerned with the happenings befa)l-
ing Dana Andrews after he has
gone out into the swamp in search
of his dog “Trouble.” On his first
night in the swamp he meets Walter
Brennan, who’d been sentenced to
hang for murder, but who'd escaped
from the sheriff. They become

warm friends, and Dana agree to,
look after Walter’s daughter, Anne’

Baxter. He proceeds to fall in

love with her, and finding the whole

“murder was framed, locates the true

murderer, The fadeout consists of
a fight between Dana and Walter
against the true murderer and_his
pal. “Trouble” appears at the right
psychological moment, and the pic-
ture ends with wedding bells in the
offering for the young couple.

The Filth Columnist

By ? 7???

You can imagine how surprised
the columnist was when that pic-
ture .appeared last week. There
really is a lot of resemblance and
I really hope the ed. will continue
the use of it.

With functions of three frater-
nities this week-end -you’d think
that picking up dope would be as
easy as endorsing checks, but either
the stories on the three dances
were too good to print or too. mild
to be stories, so we'll do the best
we can with a long and red face.

One story that slipped tfrqugh
the keyholes concerns one lovely
and radiant Phi Gam date whom
DICK O'HAIR insisted on carry-
ing to Rock Hill to avoid the snak-
ing and.scheming ALF TAYLOR.
RALPH WILLIAMS’ date sent
him one of those last minute (I'll

MR.
messages the day before the Fiji

let GAFFNEY explain it)
function. The Fireman’s Hall ‘was
literally ablaze with Phi Gams and
dates.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon entertain-
ment centered around a game of
Sniff, that sensational chummy
game which has been promoted by
MAC (I’ve won by a nose) BRUCE.

One big-time Alabama newspaper
carried a picture of WEBSTER

McLEOD’S sensational BONNIE
DELL BOYD, whose engagement
was announced this week to some
lieutenant. Nice work, WEBBIE.
LEWIS BIBB pulled a new one
this week-end in the act of spend-

i

ing the night on one of the benches
or somewhere in the bus station.
RHEA DABNEY finds out some-
thing new about same bus station.
When he started in through the
door that operates through the ef-
forts of an electric eye, he found to
his dismay that it wouldn’t open
without a second person with him.
Could this be the reason some of
his “friends” call him SHADOW?

Jumping JACK WESTALL made
his weekly pilgrimage to the shrine

of his bride-to-be. PAT RU-
DOLPH looks forward to Mid-
Winters with PHOEBE from

BEEVY coming down.

Then there’s the story concern-
ing LONG JOHN. BELK, HUGH
SPRUNT and ED LUCAS, and
PETER YOUNG, when they top-
ped all with a sub-poena to save
a negro from charges of man-
slaughter in Virginia this week.

Sponsoring for the Sigma Phi
Epsilon dance at the Woman's Club
was PETE MONROE of Charlotte
who tripped down from the sorority
pledge dance at Carolina with the
crew of JIMMIE FULCHER, ED
ERWIN, BILL LYMAN et als.,
to make this a fine week-end.
CORNFOLWER- MAIZE LY-
MAN was last seen at Carolina
looking up some alleged cousin
whom it turned out’ had transferred
to U. T. three years ago.

Wheeler, Fish

What’ was significant to Ameri-

of Senator Wheeler and Represen-
tative Fish. Wheeler’s now-famous
“Lick hell. out of ’em,” and” Fish’s
dramatic, fiery talk in the House
after the President's address, were
incidents that served to instill in
youth once more a confidence in
a unified legislature and a_uni-
fied nation, devoid of personal ob-
sessions. These utterings served |
to make the Senate vote unanimous
and the House (with the exception
of one over-sentimantal example
of the female species) did the same.

many Davidson students who hat

Around every available radio for-
getting their meat and potatoes,
hundreds of students huddled: Their
faces weren’t sad; their collective
expressions were a study of Ameri-
can youth as it accepted the grim
reality of war in their time. Sand-
wiched uncomfortably between two
of the worst conflicts in the annals
of mankind, our generation accepted
these grim facts seriously ,but not
cowardly ; cooly, but not with a
blase air about them. I don’t believe
that we were stunned, because for
the. past-twe- years we've “joked”
about when we were going to
Europe, and whether we could finish
the school year. No, we took it in
our stride. After all, when you've
been hearing nothing but ¢ommuni-
