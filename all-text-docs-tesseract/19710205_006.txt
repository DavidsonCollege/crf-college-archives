‘Kittens Try New Offense

By PETER MICHAEL
Sports Writer

Featuring a new offense,
and much improved play
from (Mike Sorrentino, Gor-
don Glasgow, andPaul Wag-
ner, the Davidson (Wildkit-
tens enter the most difficult
part of their schedule with
a 9-3 record.

‘Freshman coach Neil Mc-
Geachy replaced his stack
offense with a 1-2-2 or dou-
ble post offense. The main
reason for the change was
to allow more versatility on
offense.

According to (Mike Soren-

tion, ‘‘Everybody~ has, a
chance to score, we don't
have to rely on John (Fal-
coni)."’

Falconi has been averag-
ing 25 poirits per game in-
cluding a high of 3 points
against UNC-C, which earn-
ed him the MVP trophy for
the game. ~

In addition, Falconi has
been driving towards the
basket more frequently, with
great success against Wake
Forest.

Says McGeachy, ‘‘Falconi
has been a complete player
all year, Defensively, he's
done a good job on every-

Newton N ears
National Times

Jim Newton became a
swimmer quite by accident.

The accident, however,
has been a boon to both Tom
‘Stevens and the swimming
team,

‘As a sophomore Newton
surprisingly took two first in
the IMAC swimming meet.
It was quite a shock since
the math major from Atlan-
ta had never swum compe-
. titively in his life.

Coach Stevens noticed his
winning times’ in the 50 and
100 yard freestyle and in-
vited him to tryout for the
team.

(Newton quickly developed
into one of Davidson's top
swimmers and last year set
school records in both the
50 and 100 yard freestyle.

This season has meant
more. improvement for the
senior team captain. In the
squad’s two meets this past
weekend he claimed firsts
in the 50 and 100 yard free-
Style in the two meets
against [Emory and DeKalb
College.

In the meet with Emory
he again shattered the
school record in the 50 with

atime of 0:22.72. The mark.

was.only .7 seconds from the
conference..record.
His times~have— brought

Coach Stevens to consider
the possibility that Newton
could enter the nationals
later this year.

His 50 yard time is .9
second away from quallifica-
tion in the nationals while
his 100 yard freestyle time
is 1.9 seconds shy.

If Newton should get his
times down, it would be the
first time’ Davidson has
ever. been represented at
the nationals.

(Newton hasn't been the

only bright spot on the team
as the squad picked up their
second victory of the season
Friday against DeKalb Col-
lege prior to losing to Emory
on Saturday.

Stevens Has mentioned
several other swimmers who
have improved rapidly. Jack
Hobbs picked up two firsts
in the team’s trip to Atlan-
ta.

‘He also cited (Eric: Vernon
and John Knox, divers, and
Greg Devane, a _ distance
swimmer, for their fine
Showings in \Atlanta.

and Howard Boyd work out in

one we've assigned him to,
and John’s passing has been
excellent lately.”

McGeachy had been some-
what concerned with the
low scoring of Mike Sorren-
tino, but Mike broke out of
his scoring slump witb 26
points against VMI, a team
with an 11-1 record.

Sorrentino. has been aver-
aging more than seven as-
sists per game, specializing
in bewildering passes off the
fast break.

‘Paul Wagner has improv-
ed his rebounding of late
with a season high of 16
against Wake Forest, but the
Wildkittens rebounding may
be affected by the. injury
sustained by T. J. Pecorak.

‘Pecorak broke a bone in
his left hand in the Wake
Forest game either when he
hit his hand on the back-
board trying to block a.shot,
or when he smashed his fist
into the basket support in
anger following the play.

Two other player who will
be seeing considerable ac-
tion especially with the in-
jury to Pecorak are 6'6”
Gordon Glasgow and Pey-
ton Prospere. ~~

Although only 6’ in height,
Prospere’s hustle has al-
lowed him a great deal of
playing time. In addition,
Prospere has improved
somewhat on offense with 14
points against Lees{(McRae.

According to (McGeachy,
‘Peyton’ isn’t flashy, but ‘he
has “poise, doesn't make
many errors, plays good de-
fense, and comes up with
some steals.”

Glasgow played little in
the beginning of the year
but probably will start most
of the remaining games.
Gilasgow's rebounding has
improved, as shown by. the
11 rebounds he pulled down
in about half a game against
‘Wake Forest.

Thinclads Open
At VMI Relays

son opens tomorrow. with
the biggest indoor meet of

Whittle, was optimistic
about the ‘Cats chances at
VMI.

‘Although no Davidson run-
ner has won at VMI, he felt
that. this year’s team was

stronger than before and
would make a good show-
ing.

largely .composed of fresh-
men, but only Steve Shank-
weiler will travel to VMI.
Shankweiler will be en:
tered in shot competition.

gories.
