Smith’s resignation from Board of
Trustees stemmed largely from objections to
the process by which the bylaw change was
made.

“I’ve given a lot of my heart and soul to
Davidson, and this hurts,” Smith said in ref-

erence to his

disagree-
ment with
the process
_ behind the
board’s deci-
sion. “I don’t

t hionk

Davidson is

the college

that I

thought _ it

was.”

future plans

for giving,
Smith _ said
that he

would honor
his outstand-
ing pledges

to the col-
lege.
“I think

that for any-
one who
feels strongly enough about something to
resign, it stands to reason that it will affect
his level of giving,” he said. “I don’t intend
to give any more money to the school in the
foreseeable future.”

Bradberry said that last week’s Charlotte
Observer article publicizing Belk and
Smith’s resignation has caused supporters of
the change, who were previously quiet, to
contact the College.

“Even though you never want to see any-
thing that is in any way negative about the
College in the Observer, it has also brought |
out some of the people who are the support-
ers,” Bradberry said. ““We’ve had people who
have said that they want to give because of
this, and people who have said ‘I want to
double or quadruple my gift.”

Shannon McFayden ’82 reduced her giv-
ing when she learned of the Christian
requirement several years ago.

“With the recent change, I have increased
my giving and feel strongly that I want to
Stay in this conversation.”

Although McFayden views the recent
bylaw change as progress, she said would

ultimately like to see the entire board, not
just the 20 percent, to be open to non-
Christians.

McFayden’s husband, also a Davidson
graduate, has withdrawn support from the

school because he does not think the change

has gone far enough.

“I have said, ‘Hooray for progress’ and he
has said, ‘Not enough,” McFayden said.

Director of Alumni Relations Matt Merrell
characterizes the reaction from alumni
toward the resignation of Belk and Smith as
“fairly minimal.”

“There are some alumni who are a little
embarrassed by the publicity and that two
strong supporters of the college would take
such a public stand in opposition to a policy
that they support,” he said. “And there are
others who are motivated by their [Belk and
Smith’s] opposition to voice their own oppo-
sition to the change.”

Merrell said that while the college will
miss having Belk and Smith on the Board of
Trustees, the leaders who remain on the
board are “very capable of leading the insti-
tution” and bring “knowledge and wisdom
from their considerable success in the corpo-
rate and non-profit world” to their tasks on
the board.

Although John Belk’s main contribution is
the $28 million Belk Scholarship endow-
ment, he has also funded the Belk Arena in
the Baker Sports Complex and contributed to
other causes.

The Belk family has a long and generous
history of giving and leadership at Davidson

“I’ve given a lot of my heart and
soul to Davidson, and this hurts. I
don’t think Davidson is the college
that I thought it was.”

College.

Many of the buildings bearing the Belk
name, including Belk Dormitory and the
Visual Arts Center, have not been financed
by John Belk but by other members of the
Belk family.

John Belk’s niece, Katie Belk Morris, is
also currently a member of the Board of
Trustees.

Smith’s lifetime giving total is $2.6 mil-
lion.

His gifts to the school include the Stephen
B. Smith field in Richardson Stadium, an
endowment to the football program and a
scholarship.

Union, continued from page 2

This year, the Union Board has cospon-
sored an open-mike night with the Dos
Generaciones Alliance and a stand-up come-
dy act with the Asian Cultural and Awareness
Association.

“The benefit of cosponsoring is that we’re
a much larger student organization than
most, and we’re able to help out smaller
organizations because we’re interested in all
student groups,” Cox said.

Gentile added that cosponsoring “eases
the stress on our budget when we don’t have
to sponsor something every night.”

Next year, the Union Board hopes to con-
tinue and expand on its most popular events
and brainstorm new ideas for weekend enter-
tainment.

They recently formed a new committee
called the Lake Committee, which will coor-
dinate April at the Lake next spring and plan
other events to encourage students to utilize
the lake campus. The committee will be
headed by Walker Saik ’06 and Wilson
McCrory °07, the SGA members who
planned this year’s April at the Lake.

“Wilson and I had always thought April at
the Lake fit more under the Union Board
umbrella,” Saik said. “It’s not that SGA has-
n’t done a good job with it, and we still plan
to include them in the sponsorship, but the
Union Board simply knows how to run

“i ay

social events. That’s their job, and they’re
more used to changing committee heads
from year to year which will help make April
at the Lake an annual event and not just a

two or three year show.”

The Union Board also wants to increase
the frequency of student performances on
campus. Russell Howard ’06, a member of
the Generals and the recent Battle of the
Bands-winning group The Blue
Barnstormers, is heading the Student
Performers Committee.

“For starters there will be an open mic
type event hopefully once a month in the 900
room,” Howard said. “Right now there are
virtually no opportunities for student per-
formance, and it’s our goal to make those
available. Also, we hope to have a perform-
ance every Thursday night in the 900 room
dedicated to one performer or band - for
those that have enough material to play a
whole set.”

Gentile expects next year to be full of
exciting opportunities for students.

“We want to have fun from the very begin-
ning,” Gentile said. “We want to start off
with a bang and end with a bang.”

Students who are interested in serving on
the Union Board can sign up for different
committees during next fall’s activities fair
or contact any of the chairs to ask to be
placed on the email list.

Union Board members wait to greet students at the Class of ’06’s Orientation.

Waldron, continued from page 1

“Several fundraisers are being scheduled
around Memorial Day,” said Arbuckle. “Our
goal is not so much a numerical figure is that
we want Charles to come home from Iraq
and find his house stacked to the ceiling with
letters from
people that are
supporting the
troops and that
have given to
the fund,”
Arbuckle said.

Arbuckle
described
Waldron as “a
fairly soft spo-

ken guy who
has a_ laser
wit.” Arbuckle
and Waldron
were in SAE,
spent holidays
together and

stil communi-
cate regularly.

with ROTC, to
signing up for
Korea, to serv-
ing in Iraq—

he was someone who had given back to his
country.”

President Bobby Vagt served as Waldron’s
advisor. Vagt said Waldron’s service in Iraq
is “a clear demonstration of a person setting
his mind to something and then making it
happen.”

Waldron served -time_in Sguth Korea
before being transferred to Iraq: He is in 44th
Engineer Battalion, 2nd BCT, and 2nd
Infantry Division.

The Fallen Heroes Fund provides “unre-
stricted grants to the families of military per-
sonnel who have given their lives in the cur-
rent operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.”

Eleven thousand dollars is given to each
spouse and $5,000 is given to each depend-
ent child as a result of a death through mili-
tary service. The Fallen Heroes Fund aims
to assist families with the financial burden of
losing a family member. The monetary gift
also serves as‘a “thank you” to acknowledge
the family’s sacrifice for the good of the
nation.

Tess Leppert ’05 is also involved with
raising money for the Fallen Heroes Fund.
Leppert’s 35-year old brother, Thomas, has
been to Iraq twice with the Special Forces
Recon.

“My brother’s biggest concern while in
Iraq was the roadside bombs,” Leppert said.
“He was happy that his Hummers were
armored because many were not.”

Safely home from his service in Iraq,
Thomas is married and has two children.

“My brother definitely lost friends while
he was there,” Leppert said. “The Fallen
Heroes Fund is a way to acknowledge the
families andtheir hardships in losing a loved
one in Battle.”
