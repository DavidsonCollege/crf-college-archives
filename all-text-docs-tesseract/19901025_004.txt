Priscilla Fullerton will perform at Davidson

Musical Haiku
Highlights Concert

By CARLA WALKER

The Davidson College Depart-
ment of Music presents “Twent-
eth Century American Piano
Music” performed by Priscilla
Fullerton on Monday, October 29.
The concert will begin at 8:15 p.m.
in Hodson Hall of the Cunning-
ham Fine Arts Center.

A highlight of this concert will
be its closing work, Haiku Sonata
for Piano, composed by the col-
Icge’s composer in residence,
Wilmer Hayden Welsh. Haiku
Sonata for Piano is a highly un-
usual work that takes its name from
anancicntform of Japanese poctry
called the haiku.

The, haiku consists of seven-
tcen syllables arranged in three
lines of five, seven and cleven
syllables cach. These highly struc-
tured poems must be written sub-
tly to deal with a subject from
nature and to present the poet’s
objective reaction to it.

In Welsh’s picce the same
subtle ideas are conveyed through
musical transitions of four sepa-
rate, but related haikus. He created
the composition by arranging the
twelve notes of the chromatic scale
into three distinct patterns known
as twelve-tone rows. Welsh com-
ments that it is an “effort on my
part to convey, through music, the
objective reality common to usall.”

Patricia Fullerton said that she
had never played a haiku for piano

- before she worked with Welsh on
his Haiku Sonata for Piano. She
has performed it once in Pennsy]-

vania and said the audience “re- -

ceived it well” and that she “looks
forward to performing the piece
for more colleges.” Fullerton de-
scribes Welsh’s haiku as “an aes-
thetic though indescribable expe-
rience,” much like “staring in awe
atabeautiful sunset and then trying
to express what you see and feel.”

The opening work, Poly-
chrome, a Suite for Piang, is also
by Welsh. It derives its name from
the Greek word “polychromen,”
meaning “many colors.” This term

lends itself to Welsh’s work of ~

powerful background colors

through two precomposcd aspects
of the work. The first is a rhythm
whichis governed by twelve dances
arranged in three groups of four.
The second aspect is the use of
twelve-tone rows, the composi-
tional technique identical to that of
his Haiku Sonata for Piano.

In addition to Welsh’s works,
Priscilla Fullerton will also per-
form Ross Lee Finney’s Fantasy,
John Powell’s Sonata Teutonica,
and The Vale of Dreams by Char-
les T. Griffes.

Welsh received a B.S. from
Johns Hopkins University, and a
bachelor of music and a master of
music from the Peabody Conser-
vatory. He was awarded the pres-
tigious diploma in organ perform-

_ ance from the Peabody,

He is known both as an organ-
ist and acomposcr. He has played
recitals in many parts of the coun-
try, often presenting programs
comprised entirely of his own
pieces. He has written more than
140 compositions, some of which
have been performed in Europe
and Asia, as well as the United
States.

They include several operas,
twoconcerti, precludes, sonatas and
two symphonics. He became a
member of the faculty and college
organist at Davidson College in
1963. In 1972, he was appointed

_the professor of music, and in 1976

he received the Thomas Jefferson
Award for outstanding teaching.
In recognition of his contribution
to music, Davidson named him
“composer in residence” in 1987.

Priscilla Fullerton is associate
professor of music at Edinboro
University of Pennsylvania. A
graduate of the Cleveland Institute
of Music and the University of
Illinois; she has studied with Dean
Sanders, Eugene List, Grant Johan-
neson and Jorge Bolet. Since her
debutin New York at the Carnegie
Recital Hall in 1979, she has per-
formed extensively throughout the
eastern and midwestern United
States. Her specialties include
works. of both American and
women composers.

Sanchez

of the day, Sanchez evoked great
emotion from the students. “She
added fire to the class,” Dr. Long
said. The class ended with a circle
of students, hand in hand, each
student expressing what he or she
was thinking and feeling.

Many of the students voiced
their desire for a professor like
Sanchez at Davidson. Sophomore
Carey. Stewart said, “She was the

best and most influential speaker
I’ve ‘heard since I’ve been at
Davidson.”

Presently, Sanchez holds the
Laura Carnell Chair in English at
Temple University in Philadelphia.
She has won numcrous awards
including the 1985 American Book
Award, the 1984 Lucretia Mott
Award, the 1988

Pennsylvania Governor’s
Award for Excellence in the
Humanitics and the 1988 Peace
and Freedom Award from the
Women’s International League for
Peace and Freedom.

Sanchez says she uses words
to “erase pain.” She writes of per-
sonal dealings with the death of
her grandmother at age six and the
stuttering that resulted from that
trauma.

She also deals with racism, sex-
ism, child abuse, drug abuse, the
death of her brother from AIDS
and any other issue about which
she feels passionate.

Her appeal is universal. As Dr.
Long said, “Her commitment is to
understand, accept and know who
you are, and only then see each
other clearly.”

theory, he said that in February

1917, no one would have heard of -

people.

The final alternative, which he
regarded is being possibly most
likely, was chaos, resulting from
the continuing collapse of author-
ity until no chains of command

continue to exist. He called this the
“Lebanization of the Sovict Un-
ion.” An ominous possibility that
he suggested might happen under
sucha scenario would be the usage
of nuclear weapons by a bellicose
group.

A Charlotte native, Allison
attended Davidson, from which his
brother graduated, for two years
before being recruited to play foot-

ball at Harvard, from which he
graduated.

In 1977 he became dean of the
Kennedy School, and under his ap-
proximately decade-long leader-
ship, the faculty increased from 12
to 85 and the endowment went
from $20 million to about $450
million. Among those who have
taught there are Geraldine Ferraro
and Michael Dukakis.

Houses

ments, additional bathrooms
(handicapped accessible), serviced
kitchen appliances, new windows,
new roofing (if necessary), and
new ceilings. Optional renova-
tions include additional kitchen
appliances, and a ramp for the
handicapped.

At the October 15 meeting, a
lottery system determined the or-
der in which houses would be
worked on. Kappa Sigma will be
the first to relocate to the soon to be,
completédATO" house. Collins
estimates that it will take four to

‘lows:

six weeks to complete each reno-
vation. Those houses not finished
by the end of this school year are
expected to be during the summer.
The order of renovation is as fol-
Kappa Sigma, Pi Kappa
Alpha, Black Student Coalition,
Sigma AlphaEpsilon, Rusk House,
Warner Hall House, Sigma Phi
Epsilon, Phi Delta Theta, Kappa
Alpha Order, and Spencer House.

Collins suggested that a com-
mittee be formed within the house
to present alternatives to the reno-
vations. Cindy Coppola will meet
with each committee to help with
interior design. “We will allow

; some uniqueness withineach house

as long as basic parameters are

‘ @overed; such as proper Security

and health needs,” Collins said.
Once costs are determined for
a house, Collins will solicit local
contractors to submit bids for the
project.
Collins mentioned that work

‘quality, and ability to complete

jobs on time and at cost will be the
main criteria in choosing a con-
tractor.

Collins stressed the importance
of house maintenance after the
renovations are finished. “Ihave a
responsibility to try to insure that
we provide a healthy safe environ-
ment, but lam notapoliceman, nor
do I want to be,” Collins said: “I

, come down pretty hardsometimes,
__ but I’m out for you.”

Alcohol

acoustic music performed by stu-
dent bands and a bonfire at mid-
night. Chaplain Chuck Hasty said
he hoped the dry events would
provoke students to consider the
possibilities of having fun without
alcohol.

Inaddition to dry court parties,
the parents and alumni who will be

visiting this weekend will not be

served alcohol at any college-re-
lated affairs.

Approximately 350 students
signed pledges agreeing to stay
dry this week. “We’re very pleased
withthe number of pledges signed,”
said Hasty. According to him, the
week has been very successful in
getting people to discuss alcohol
on campus openly.

A panel discussion addressing
perceptions of alcohol at Davidson
was held Wednesday afternoon.
The panel included two freshmen,
Alice Spivey and John Ogle; Tom
Larson, a member of Patterson
Court, Bob Hornsby, an independ-.
ent; Prem Manjooran, an interna-
tional student; and Dr, Leland Park,
a faculty member:

Most ti ith thatalcohol plays

a major role in social life at
Davidson, but were unsure whether
the role was too extreme. “It’s
obvious to anyone who goes down
on the Court that it (alcohol) is a
central thing. The biggest crowd is
around the stairs waiting to get a
beer,” Hornsby said. Larson said

that except forband parties, almost _

all the money spent for court par-
ties goes towards buying beer. “I’ve
witnessed fear in houses to throw a
non-alcoholic party, because

they’re_ afraid it won’t go over, —

Basically, people are saying they
don’t think they can have fun with-
out alcohol,” Larson said.

The groupalmostunanimously
felt there was little peer pressure
put on students to drink, but by
virtue of the number of people
drinking, many students drank
anyway. “I’ve seen people at par-
ties with a beer that’s gone warm in
their hand and they haven’t even
taken a sip out of it, but they still
have it,” Manjooran said.

“There’s a fecling that drinking
is anew problem and it’s not. It’s
been around forever and it is very
much a part of our society,” Park
said. Park feels the increased dis-
cussion of alcohol’s role in life at
Davidson is a move forward from
the days when alcohol consump-
tion was not discussed.

The group felt’that the Court
was blamed too much forits role in
providing alcohol’ to students.
Manjooran said alcohol is avail-
able on freshmen halls, and to those
not at Court parties. Larson said
that although some parties on the
Court are centered around drink-
ing, that’s not what the Court is all
about. Larson said, “There is so
much more that goes on down there
besides drinking. The Court is
about brotherhood and sisterhood.”

____Many-on-the-panel-expressed-

the feeling that students are be-
coming more responsible towards
drinking. Students going to the Pub |
have designated drivers, as do many
fraternities in case of the likely
event that someone should feel the
need to go to Bacon ‘n’ Eggs at
four in the morning. It was noted
that the increased awareness of
alcohol’s role in date rape has
caused many students to be more
careful about their drinking.
The group felt that not having
alcohol was not a solution to any
problems that might exist. “Not
having alcohol anywhere limits
people from learning how to use
it,” said Larson, “Part of being at
Davidson is learning how to deal
with different people in different
Situations, including one where
