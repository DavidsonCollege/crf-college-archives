“THE DAVIDSONIAN

~ Is PIRG the Best Way ?

In the recent furor over the North Carolina Public
Interest Research Group’s funding problem at Davidson,
many people have concentrated on the unilateral decision
to end “automatic” funding. Davidson students must
refocus their attitude towards PIRG. This is an
opportunity to assess PIRG at Davidson and decide if it is
worth continuing.

The referendum on Tuesday is much like the
liquor-by-the drink vote held in Meckienberg County not
long ago. It is essentially a matter of freedom; people are
not So miuch endorsing PIRG as they are voting whether
there should even be a PIRG chapter at Davidson. .

The group has indicated that without the current
income that they have been receiving from revenues
collected from students bills, they cannot continue to
operate. in the past PIRG at Davidson has annually sent
about $4000 to the central N.C. PIRG Office in Durham.
The Durham office if Davidson PIRG's lifeblood in terms

if the referendum. fails, their money is gone, therefore,
their connection with this central office is severed. PIRG
dies at Davidson. So the referendum boils down to the
question “Should PIRG exist at Davidson?”

Underlying this query -are more less theoretical
questions that should be considered before the voting
begins. Specifically:

—What does thé college owe any extracurricular
group? If the college is to help a group collect funds
because that group helps the residents of Both the
college and the state, then could.not the case be made for
collecting money for other community oriented organiza-
tions, Jike the Y Student Service Corps?

—What exactly has PIRG at Davidson accomplished?
_References to a pharmaceutical drug survey, nuclear
rallies, and a Nestle boycott are nebulous; we need to
know specifics.

—PIRG claims it really needs the state organization,
but just how much money. would they have to send to the
central office in Durham to maintain a relationship? Last
year our chapter sent $4000 to Durham and got back $400
ta use right here on campus. Would the central office

The Davidsonian is neither defending nor attacking
PIRG. Active involvement by Davidson students in public
interest issues is important. The question is “Is PIRG the
best way?” ; —Merideth Durden

To the Editor:

Once again the spectre of
satire rears its ugly head at
Davidson, and the good people
of the college sally forth to do
battle with. it—be it good, bad,
or indifferent. I refer, of course,
to the column on Josh McDow-
ell and the subsequent letter to
the editor by Messrs. Niblock
‘and Malone.

.. First, Mason’s column was
presented as opinion, not as a
news story. Under those cir-
cumstances, the two indignant
authors of the epistle had no
right to encourage the denial of
the right to self-expression to

nine teams in the S.C. This year
the team could finish as high as
4th in the conference. ~

The improvement of the team
is mainly attributable to Dr.
Koller’s presence on the team.
At the expense of his own free
time Dr. Koller has spent
numerous hours with the team
organizing and coaching it effi-
ciently and effectively. In addi-
tion to this, Dr. Koller is the
first Davidson cross-country

failure to clarify this: situation
has caused significant disen-
chantment among all students.
We fell some sort of clarification
has become a necessity. We
require a substantial reply.

At this point, it is our feeling
that an injustice has been done,
perhaps through error, to those
people denied tenure last
spring. Dr. Koller, of our de-
partment, is of special concern
to us, as well as the case we
know best, and thus will be the
main concentration of this peti-
tion. Undoubtedly by now you
are tired of seeing letters in
support of him, considering the
volume written, but apparently
still more is needed. We would

The Campus Forum

Mike Mason simply because his
opinions do. not coincide with
those of Messrs. Niblock and
Malone. My uncle, himself a
Presbyterian minister, is fond
of saying that when you throw a
rock into a pack of dogs, the one
who yelps loudest is the one you
hit. In other words, it is their

’ own closed-mindedness that

Niblock and: Malone should. be
worried about.

Though but a freshman, Ma-
son’s writing style shows that
he is secure enough that he is
not afraid to be humorously
self-deprecating in print. This
quality is lacking in far too
many Davidson students, not
to mention many writers who
are thrice Mason’s age and have
proportionately more writing
experience. Mason subtly pokes
fun at his own attitudes (which
even the most ardent feminist
will probably. admit are in-

grained .by society and: not —

self-developed); this fact goes
over the heads of our two irate
epistolarians.

Perhaps Mason’s opinions as

chauvinism, but are Niblock
and Malone any more qualified
than anyone else to say that? I
think not. I personally find
Mason's column a refreshing
change from the semi-literate
fluff of Bill Peeples and the
outright garbage of Bonehead
and the Brick Brothers, who
haven't got the guts to sign
their names while freely assas-
sinating more characters than
_ever got zapped in the Guide to
Courses at Davidson.

to laugh at oneself, one can’t

really live in this world—one
only survives. Mike Mason has
shown himself to be more than
just another survivor.

Last year Dr. Koller helped

Dr. Koller to see if a few months
hindsight hasn’t changed their
decision.

Professors For PIRG

To the Editor

On Tuesday October 9th, the
student body here makes a
choice—whether or not a chap-
ter of the North Carolina Public
Interest Research Group (NC
PIRG) will continue to exist at
Davidson. We hope students

. will make a wise choice.

A complete education re-
quires concern with real-world
problems and issues, as well as
with academic subjects. When
students tackle public policy
matters which concern them
and learn through research,
advocacy and lobbying how
changes are effected, an invalu-
able addition to their education
results. Since 19783, NC PIRG,
with its state-wide structure
and full-time staff, has given
Davidson ‘students opportun-
ities to learn how to move
towards solutions to social
problems in these ways. We
urge Davidson students to con-
tinue to be part of this signifi-
cant state and national effort by
voting to keep a PIRG chapter
at Davidson.

like to address ourselves first to
the case as it relates to the new
Code of Faculty Evaluation.
The first and foremost criter-
ja for professors.stated within
the Code is excellence in teach-
ing. This is, as it should be, the
primary consideration in the

’» tenure decision. Davidson has a

tradition of commitment to the
teaching of students, as stated
in the Statement of Purpose:
‘*...Davidson has chosen to be a
college, to emphasize the teach-
ing responsibility of all profes-
sors...’ etc. On this point it is
hard to believe that anyone at
this institution could be signifi-
cantly better qualified tha Dr.
Koller. His student evaluations
have always been high, both
written and verbal. His courses
are in high demand. The quality
of his lectures is unsurpassed
within the department and
ranks with the top in the school.
He has introduced five new
courses into the curriculum and
is almost constantly overload-
ed. It may seem a bit cliche to
say that the students are the
best judges of a professor’s
teaching ability; nevertheless,
no one else has heard as many of
his lectures, taken as many
independent studies from him,
nor gained as many benefits
from his commitment as we. By
the only yardstick available, the
man more than measures up.
