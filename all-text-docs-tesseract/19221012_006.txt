6 THE DAVIDSONIAN, OCTOBER 12, 1922
BIBLE CLASSES MEET Ogden as the teacher, the class{ready on the field. Paul and Barnabas
IN EACH DORMITORY promises to be a real benefit to those} were acquainted with and sent out by

A Bible class is being held on every
floor of each dormitory and-in every
two sections of the barracks on Wed-
nesday nights. These are being led by
competent religious leaders of the
campus.

A class is held on Tuesday night in
Doctor Sentelle’s class room for
training the leaders. This class is ably
led by Professor Currie. At the last
leaders’ meeting 19 were present, it is
urged upon all leaders to make it a
point to be present at this class, as the
success of the student classes is directly
dependent on well trained leaders. The
subject of the lesson for last time was:
Why Should a Student Follow Christ?
What is your ideal of a Christian Stu-
dent? And, is such an ideal repre-
sented on our campus?

William T. Baker, Y cabinet direc-
tor of Bible classes, has asked that each
class appoint a secretary who will
make a report to him of the attendance
at every meeting. Because of the lack
of these secretaries a complete report
was not obtainable. Only two classes
reported, the third floor Watts had
cight present; third and fourth sec-
tions North barracks had 14 present.
There are 31 classes on the Hill.

MINISTERIAL BAND IS
ADDRESSED BY WEEKS

The Ministerial Band was addressed
last Sunday by Guy Weeks, president
of the North Carolina Volunteer
Union and of the Davidson Volunteer

Band. Guy gave a brief history of the

Volunteer movement, related its pur-
pose, and urged that the local Volun-
teer and Ministerial Bands work to-
gether in greater harmony,

The Volunteer movement was
launched 20 years ago by Robert E.
Speer and Robert P. Wilder, better
known as Father Wilder, who were
then students. Its purpose is to unite
in closer fellowship all college and uni-
versity students who anticipate future
Christian service in some foreign field
and to encourage others to enter the
same great calling. The work is
organized into national, state and dis-
trict unions. ;

The declaration card, which all
members are required to sign is merely
a statement that it is their purpose to
serve on the foreign field if God so
permits. It is not a pledge.

Guy urged that the members of the
Ministerial and Volunteer Bands live
such Christian lives that others may
see in them the power of . fully God-
surrendered lives. His talk was closed
by etxending an invitation to the Min-
isterial Band members to attend: the
‘weekly Sunday morning Volunteer
Band meetings which are held in the
“Y” reading room.

‘ Possibly the most important work
‘of the Ministerial Band at presenti is

class has been organized which

SOUTH CAROLINA CLUB
HOLDS INITIAL FEED

One club has done something other
than have its picture made for the an-
nual. The South Carolina Club held a
feed on last Saturday evening in the
gymnasium,

Bill Cooper was toastmaster for the
55 or 60 assembled Sandlappers, while
Windy Aikin and Tally Elliot officiated
for the Freshmen initiation. This fur-
nished amusement throughout the eve-
ning. i

Each new member publicly an-
nounced his name, home town and re-
lation, if any, to former Davidsonians.
Many identified themselves as being
brothers, cousins or friends of some of
Davidson’s worthy sons.

One of the most enjoyable features
of the program was the serving of
sandwiches, dopes, ice cream and
cakes, followed by cigars, cigarettes
and peanuts,

The Sandlappers plan to have an en-
rollment of 100 of the Palmetto State's

best in next year’s club.

CHRISTIAN ENDEAVOR.
HOLDS TRAINING CLASS

In Shearer Hall at 15 minutes after
1 every Sunday afternoon there is a
Christian Endeavor Expert Training
class conducted by W. A. Gamble.
This class is open to all the students of
Davidson who are interested in Chris-
tian Endeavor work, and who! would
like to help spread the cause of Chris-
tian Endeavor.

Last Sunday T, A. Guitan spoke
about the organization and the pur-
pose of each society of Christian En-
deavor. After Guitan had finished S.
C. Fain told about the separate com-
mittees and their duties. The meet-
ing was extremely interesting and
every student who attended it felt that

he had gained from it.

PROFESSOR FOREMAN
SPEAKS ON MISSIONS

Drawing his thoughts from the ac-
count of early missionaries in Acts 13:
1-4, Professor Foreman gave a few
suggestions to the Volunteers, at their
regular meeting, concerning their call-
ing and preparation. ~

In the first place, the Volunteer
must be a man of training. Paul was
one of the greatest scholars of his day.

Again, he must be a man of ex-
perience; as young doctors do intern
work before entering upon their pro-
‘fession, so preachers should not go
into his work without some previous
experience. Paul and Barnabas had
preached for a while in Antioch before
they went. ’ ; rN

Lastly, the Volunteer. should early
become acquainted with the'church and
mission that are to send him out to the
foreign field, and write to the mis-
sionaries so that he will know that he
.will have congenial work under the

iss. With Dunbar

mission and with the missionaries al-

the local church. Also there is no
greater inspiration to the Volunteer
than to know that there is a church at
home interested in him and praying for
him.

P. C. FRESH ELEVEN TO
MEET SCRUBS OCT. 19TH

- Nothing except victories over Caro-
lina, Trinity and Furman, would please
the Davidson student body more than
the victory of our Wildcat Freshies
over the P. C. Freshman team. These
two elevens tie up.in Rock Hill on
October 19th anda battle royal is
promised.

The game is sure to be a hard
fought affair. The Blue Stocking
Yearlings have a team that compares
favorably with their varsity in weight
and smoothness, and no one questions
their spirit. Last week this team took
the measure of the University of South
Carolina Greenies, 7-0.

The Wildcat Fresh are sure to give
a good account of themselves. They
have had plenty of hard work, having
taken on the varsity several times each
week, and will relish a game with a
team a little nearer their own weight.
Theirs is also a smooth-running
machine and yield to none on the ques-
tion of fighting spirit.

Although it is too early to give any
definite line-up, the young Cats will
probably be chosen from among the
following: Laird, Sappenfield, Black,
McDonald, Buck and Alford, backs;
Baker, Crayton, Daughton, Anderson,
McMillan, Green, Cox, Potts and
others, linemen.
