Bondanella Advocates,

‘Stress Social Science’

You spent last year in
France in the Junior Year
Abroad Program. With the
experience of another edu-
cational system behind you,
how would you modify Dav-
idson’s general educational
approach?

‘Well, let’s begin with my
major, political science.
There are just two people in
the department and they
simply can’t give enough
course offerings. I'm just
lucky that what they offer
is what I am interested in.

“But take this semester—
I’m doing research in Afri-
can studies and Marxist po-
litical theory and there’s not
much in the library. The
professors are doing what
they can, but I can’t buy all
the books I need nor can I
run up to Chapel Hill every
weekend.

“Actually this particular
problem of mine points to
something bigger. {£ think
Davidson needs a stronger
emphasis on the social
sciences. There ought to be
a better balance between
the normative and behav-
riorist approaches — be-
tween theory and practice,
though that is not quite ex-

The Davidsonian

act.

“There are many possi-
bilities, a lot of them cen-
tered on a problem ap-
proach that would link dis-
ciplines, say through more
team teaching. I’d like to
know more, for instance, of
the effects of cybernetics or
politics, or psychology on
politics. ;

“If nothing else I think
every student should know
something of the founda-
tions of the social sciences
and human ‘behavior. Can
this study be made into a
science, as such? Who are
the main theorists? Most of
us simply don’t know much
about it. You need to know
the basie terms if nothing
else.

“Economics probably
does a better job of intro-
ducing this study than most
other courses. The introduc-
tory course is really an in-
troduction in the nature of
economics. But look at
political science: the intro-
ductory course is American
government. It is an excel-
lent course, but it would
seem better to learn the
principles and methodology
of the field of political

REPORT

SENIOR
PERSPECTIVES

ene

Three of the top five students scholastically in the
senior class were selected by THE DAVIDSONIAN
recently to offer candid opinions of Davidson as they
near the end of four years of studies here. This spe- =
cial DAVIDSONIAN Report was supervised by Rufus
Adair, DAVIDSONIAN Associate Editor.

Williams Looks
‘Monastery Without Courage’

Perhaps this question
should be saved until last
but what in a few words in
your general overall view
characterizes Davidson Col-
lege?

“In a favorite phrase of
mine, it is a monastery with-
‘out courage.”

Exactly what do you mean by
thet?

“Davidson is, isolated geo-
graphically, religiously and intel-
tectually the way a monastery
is. But a monastery realizes the
value of its differences. David-
son, however, succumbs to out-
side pressure.”

A couple of years ago a David-
son graduate spoke here and
calsed a question thet might
heve bearing on whet you were
just saying. Why do you think
so relatively few Davidson grad-
uates become active politicians,
especially on the state level?

“Most Davidson men go into
a profession, and as a doctor or
@ lawyer or what-have-you, they
can and do exert positive so-
cial concern in politics. But

many of them, however, like

the old Davidson. idea of stay-
ing out of controversy and of
trying to do things behind the
scenes. Others, unfortunately,
like everything the way it is.

To change the subject and to
get a litte more specific, what
is your opinion on the education-
at program at Davidson? What
about survey courses?

“I never liked them.”

You were in the humanities
program; what are your views
on 10?

“It should be drastically re-
organized. The course does not
necessarily have to be presented
in a chronological line, and
neither is this method even de-
sirable.

“The idea of the course, that
is, getting away from a sep-
aration of courses, is a good
one. It’s just that I think the
form could be changed to a
“problem method’’ with an em-
phasis on the way ideas are
good, the way the conflict in
their application.

“There is a difference In what
an idea is now and what it was,
or at least what its implications
were, in its formative stages.
This method is usually used only
to discuss the French and in-
dustrial revolutions.

‘Liberal arts colleges are usu-
ally wound up on tradition stud-
ies, and these usually are then
chronogical. Davidson is fasci-
nated with it. Ideas don’t be-
come abstractions because of the
passage of time; tradition is
not unified because it was in
the past.

“We usually wind up talking
about the things that were left
over and forget the conflict from
which it evolved.”

in a@ more general sense than
the humanities program, what
do you fee! about team teach-

ing?

“The idea of team teaching
is not so pressing here as at a
larger school where disciplines
and even various departments’
are more isolated from each
other. Here you are not so
liable to be caught with a bunch!
of specialists—say. electrical en- ;
gineers—for four years.” j

Now that you bring It up, do
you think that the sclences are!
properly understood by liberal
arts majors and vice-versa?

“T would have to say that few
realize the implications and the
relationships between the two.
We have only one course in the’

science before beginning a
specific, substantive ap-
proach.”

Does this apply to courses
outside the social sciences?

“Sure, My main criticism is
that somebody can get out of
here with a major in a sub-
ject and know nothing of its
general nature. Can history ma-
jors handle questions such as—
‘Is there an historical Fact?’
‘A purpose in history?’ Those
who need to answer this ques-
tion aren't only philosophy ma-
jors.

“A person can leave with an
English major without knowing
anything about literature per se.
The same thing is doubly true of
pre-meds and science majors."

You mentioned a problem ap-
proach. Could you give an ex-
ample of what you mean?

“All right. I'm interested in
underdeveloped countries. I
would like to see a course
aimed atthe study of their prob-
lems—racial, cultural, economic,
what-have-you.

“The courses on Southeast

Asia and on economic develop-'

ment are steps in the right di-
rection: I would just like to
see more of it and with a more
interdisciplinary approach. Rob-
ert Theobold in his visit here

‘stressed this method of empha-

sizing problems and attacking
them from an interdisciplinary
point of view.

“I had an excellent course
under Dr. Gift last semester
which seems to be a good ex-

* ample. The major question con-

cerned War—its nature and
causes. We used sources in so-
ciology, philosophy, economics,
history, political science, and

' anthropology. to gain a more

complete view of this problem.”

What is your opinion on ves-
pers?

“I think they ought to worry
more about the curriculum than
vespers. Anybody that thinks
we gain anything is kidding

himself. I gain nothing  spirit-

“As far as Christian committ-
ment is concerned I think that
‘ta free Christian college” jis a
contradiction in terms and is
certainly a contradiction in prac-
tice here.

“I don't want to seem entire-
ly negative, but criticism is what
you want, isn't it? Let me just
throw in a couple more for the
record.

rather have locals than discrimi-
nation. The only advantage to

don’t have to. pick out three

At Davidson:

philosophy of science, and then
something mentioned in human-
ities.

“Again a problem approach
would be good—say in military
or transportation applications
alone. Why, you could study
four years alone on the faith of
present-day people in science,
moral problems of scientists, as-
sumptions in present technol-
ogy. the effects of government
money. grants, the very way
science operates. Much of this-is
hardly ‘more than mentioned
around here.”

There is a tot of talk sow
concerning compulsory vespers.
What do you feel sbout this
issue?

“As isolated as we are, the
college should be relatively free
of public attention: it should be
able to experiment more, but it
is often overwhelmed by its con-
ception of public pressure. This
is much of the problem in com-
pulsory vespers.

“Davidson is concerned with
operating a friction-free institu-
tion. I think that neither. a
Christian nor a scholar nor a
businessman could say that the
purpose of an institution is fric-
tion-free operation regardless of
what happens.

“Specifically, I have no com-
plaint as long as vespers is not
mandatory: this simply can’t be
defended on religious grounds
in this day and time. It brings
the students back on Sundays,
and it might help hold the school
together, but there are other
ways to unify a school.

“These and other like argu-
ments don’t convince me. They
tell me why it’s good to go to
church, but telling me that I
have to takes more arguments
than that."

in closing, how would you
cheracterize the Davidson stu-
dent?

“Davidson as a school is
small, isolated, and Southern
and of course this has its ef-
fect. It cuts down on artistic,
personal, and political divergen-
cies, but all this is typical of
most small schools.

“Davidson students don't seem
to recognize that things they do
change their lives, and that they
can do something about it. The
sociable chatter that replaces
thought and expression more at
Davidson than at many other
schools is of course not all bad.
People need to chatter. But
around here there is too little
of anything else.”

“There's not much you can do
about the isolated environment
here, but the general attitude
is still puritanical — like we
are hidden from the sins of the
world, from a ‘creeping hedon-
ism.’ ;

‘Everything that happens here
is twenty years late; there
seems to be little moral lead-
ership. By the time we do some-
thing, everybody else has done
it, too. In 1962 even the Uni-
versity of Mississippi had Negro
students.

“I might also add a comment
about our student leadership. It
has always seemed to me that
the student council is afraid
really to fight for the students’
interests. A typical example is
the recent drinking issue—the
two presentations of the pro-
posed amendment were so
biased in favor of administra-
tion attitudes (and so diamet-
tically opposed to student opin-
ion) that one can only infer that
student ‘government is pretty
well under the hill’s thumb.

“Like I said, it's not all bad.
but Davidson has its faults. I've
gotten a good education. The
facultystudent relationship is
good. I guess I've gotten as
much out of that as anything
else, There are obvious benefits
in a small community.”

* Clark Views Vespers

As Lecture On Religion

A few weeks ago you were
quoted in a DAVIDSON-
IAN article as being in favor
of retaining the vespers pro-
gram. Would you care to
comment further on that?

“Yes. Ideally, I see ves-
pers as an opportunity to
get good religious speakers
on campus. J think that to-
day the best thought in the
world is in drama and theol-
ogy, and I had rather see
vespers serve as a lecture
on religion rather than a
worship service, though
such services should be
made available.

“Religion is of ultimate
concern as along as it is not
centered on dogma. I can’t
see anything repugnant in
this form of vespers and
with this view in mind, I was
in favor of the council reso-
lution.

“Davidson can justify leg-
islating exposure to relig-
ious thought, though not to
obligatory worship service.
Davidson has an obligation
to make available religious
exercises, classroom studies,
and organized services, and
I think that we could get rid
of compulsory vespers with-
out altering our religious
commitment.”

Do you think If necessary for
Davidson to have such a com-
mitment?

“Rather than have Davidson
ape the northern secular schools,
I think there is something unique
in having both high academic
standards and a religious com-
mittment. And I don't think
these two are mutually exclu-
sive. I’m for maintaining this
uniqueness: I don’t care any-
thing about Davidson being
North Carolina’s answer to Am-
herst."

As one active in student gov-
ernment, how do you explain
the Davidson student’s apathy
toward student polltics?

‘In comparison: with a state
university this question is in-
valid. Often as not, student
politics is merely a platform or
a practice for the state capital.

“Though in another sense you
can compare them. Student gov-
ernment here does not really
know what its powers and power
are. They are not a useful foil
to the faculty.

_"Yet when I think of the liquor
changes and so forth that have
come about in the past few
years, maybe that statement
isn’t true. Maybe the problem
is that the students themselves
don’t realize the work of the

council. Perhaps then they
would vote more carefully: right
now the majority votes on a
basis other than competency.”

Do you foresee any changes
in this pattern?

“It could easily happen. In
the past the student: body was
more homogeneous than it is
now; today we have a greater
cross-section. I think a tonic
effect would be for some vis-
fonaries to run for office—some-
one who is highly dissatisfied,
someone who has a bigger grasp
of Davidson's social and educa-
tional problems. The real issues
aren’t just chapel culs and NSA.

“In short, I would say stu-
dent politics are dull for two
reasons: 1) candidates are uni-
form, and 2) issues just aren't
real issues.”

You are the only science ma-
jor that is being interviewed
here. Do you feel that the aver-
age science major has a suffl-
cient liberal education?

“The ‘pre-med mind’ is a
term used disparagingly by the
campus ‘Young Turks’ and to
an extent { agree with them.
Often a pre-med major has
minimal interests and is not
very inquisitive outside his field.
In many cases, he is just a
‘grade-grubber’. Maybe one so-
lution would be to do away with
the pre-med major entirely.

“At the same time, this criti-
cism is valid only If made with
some awareness of the physical
time a pre-med spends in lab.

“Then too, the cause of this
criticism is not so much Dav-
idson's as it is pressure from
graduate school and the tastes of
the individual student. There is
a course offered in the philoso-
phy of science.”’

For a non-science major, what
do you think of substituting a
general history and theory of
science course for the present
requirement?

“On first impression, it sounds
very appealing, but it is very
likely that much of what I con-
sider necessary lab work would
be omitted. The idea on the
whole is good, even moreso for
the pre-med. He needs to be
able to get away from the com-
partmentalized and the detailed
if he is to escape the charge
‘body mechanic’.

“The more I think about such

a course. the more I like it. Per-
haps they could perform a series
of the more simple classical ex-
periments.”

What do you see as David-
son’s main problem?

“Quite simply it is that of
definition. We need to define ath-
letic policy. We need to de-
cide our admissions policy.
Should sons of alumni have pref-
erential status? This question is
not presented to argue for one
side or the other, but to demon-
strate the need for decision.

“Perhaps the self-study has
some of the answers: I don’t
know. If we want to produce
competent leaders for our area,
let's not have delusions. If Dav-
idson is going to accept the im-
plication of the Ford grant, it
must take the good with the
bad.
