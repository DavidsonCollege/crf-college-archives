In New York primary

Carter narrowly wins with students _

(CPS) President Jimmy Car-
ter did much better among
students in the New York
primary than he did among the
general electorate, but stu-
dents, like: their elders, gave
Sen. Edward Kennedy a victory
in the Connecticut primary held
the same day.

In New York, Carter took 54
percent of the vote in selected
student precincts on or near the
campuses of the universities of
Buffalo, Albany, and Syracuse,
at Ithaca College, and Canisius,
Cornell, and Colgate.

Though he won a majority of
the general vote in New York,
Kennedy could only manage 46
percent of the student vote,
despite the absence of Gov.
Edmund G. Brown from the

ballot. Brown, generally at- -

tempts to appeal to the same
liberal vote as Kennedy.

A popular vote among New
York Republicans was unavail-
able because ballots were cast
for delegates, not candidates.

_. In Connecticut, Ronald Rea-
gan won 44 percent of the
Republican student vote, fol-

lowed by former Ambassador

George Bush and Rep. John —

Anderson, who virtually tied.
Anderson, who did not cam-
paign in the state, attracted
about 29 percent of the vote,
though most of his support
came from precincts surround-
ing Wesleyan University in
Middletown.

Sen. Kennedy attracted 50
percent of the 4328 Democratic
student votes cast in selected
polling places near Wesleyan,
Yale, the University of Bridge-
port, University of Connecticut,
and Southern Connecticut.

President Carter got 41 per-
cent of the vote, with the
remainder spread among “un-
committed,’’ Lyndon LaRouche
of the U.S. Labor Party, and
Brown, who got a little more
than one half of one percent of
the student vote.

Democratic student voter
turnout in New York was 42
percent. Thirty seven percent of
the Connecticut Democratic
students voted in their primary,
compared to 41 percent of the
state’s Republican students.

The five Tavares, whose mu-
sical style contains strong roots
in rhythm and blues, have
produced such hits as “Heaven
Must be Missing’ An Angel,”
“Mores Than A Woman,"’ and
“It Only Takes A Minute.”’

“We like to do good music,
happy music,’’ comments group
“Our
music reflects exactly what we
do in everyday living—think
positively."’ The group released
their ninth album, Superchar-
ged, in February.

Carolyne Mas, featured per-
former of the outdoor concert, is

amazing three months. A native
New Yorker, Mas began her
musical career with operatic
training and playing with high
school bands. Later she per-
formed in clubs with the help of
guitarist David Landau on
Bleeker Street in Greenwich
Village. Her style soon matured
and she rapidly ascended to
playing before sellout crowds.
Said one “Rolling Stone”’ re-
view of her first album: “The
result is a likeable, unpreten-
