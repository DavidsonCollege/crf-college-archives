If you thought that finding a color
Macintosh* system you could afford
was just a dream, then the new, affordable Macintosh LC is a dream

come true.

The Macintosh LCis rich in color. Unlike many computers that can display
only 16 colors at once, the Macintosh LC expands your palette to 256 colors.
Italso comes with a microphone and new sound-input technology that lets
you personalize your work by adding voice or other sounds.

Like every Macintosh computer, the LC is easy to set up and easy to
master. And it runs thousands of available applications that all work in the
same, consistent way—so once you've learned one program, you're well
on your way to learning them all. The Macintosh LC even lets you share infor-
mation with someone who uses a different type of computer—thanks to
the versatile Apple® SuperDrive,” which can read from and write to Macintosh,
MS-DOS, OS/2, and Apple II floppy disks.

Take a look at the Macintosh LC and see what it gives you. Then pinch
yourself. It's better than a dream—it's a Macintosh.
