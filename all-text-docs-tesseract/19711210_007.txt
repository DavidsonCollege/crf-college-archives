JOE EARLE :
Sports Editor :

IT IS COMMON KNOWLEDGE that Davidson's var-
sity teams have not fared as well in the last two or three
years as the powerhouse Wildcat teams of the past. David-
son’s football, basketball and track teams have almost
dropped out of the national scene altogether.

What is the burden holding down the potentially fine
teams Davidson has fielded in all varsity sports over the
past few years? The Southern Conference. Davidson has
become so caught in the quagmire of Conference competi-
tion that the Wildcats have all but sunk from the sight
of the eyes of national competition.

The best method Davidson could presently employ
to improve their situation is to drop out of the Southern
Conference.

This would not be an innovative or radical move. Like
most other programs adopted at this college. the act of be-
coming an independent in varsity competition has been
tested and proved at other schools, notably the University
of South Carolina.

USC DROPPED OUT of the Atlantic Coast Conference
when they felt that they were being unfairly hampered
by that Conference's basketball tournament. To gain a
berth in the national basketball plavoffs, USC would have
to win the ACC tourney. something they were consistently
unable to do.

Davidson's situation in the Southern Conference is
very similar. Last year. Conference - leading Wildcats were
edged out in the tournament by the Furman Paladins.
The Paladins, as winners in the tournament, represented
the SC in the national plavoffs and were cut to pieces by
Fordham.

The tournament will be stacked against the Wildcats
this vear. It is being held in Greenville, S. C.. Furman’s
home. instead of the neutral ground of Charlotte. It will
take monumental effort for the ‘Cats to wrest the crown
from the Paladins on their home court.

Without having to overcome the block of a Furman-
oriented tournament, the Davidson cagers would fare much
better in the national rankings.

DROPPING OUT OF the Southern Conference and
becoming an independent would be of great advantage
to the Wildcats in other sports also, especially soccer.
football and tennis.

Freeing the football team from a Southern Conference
schedule would help their record. The gridders have done
poorly in conference competition over the past two years.
Winning only two games.

Without the burden of having to schedule SC giants.
the gridders could settle down to a more amiable sched-
ule. facing teams like Wofford, Presbyterian, Bucknell
and Duke.

An improved season record on the football field
would greatly enhance the prestige of the team and thus
help team recruiting and help raise alumni donations to
both the college and team.

SOCCER IS ANOTHER SPORT that has much to gain
from the loss of the Southern Conference. The Conference
Is not yet well - respected in national. soccer circles. Win-
ning the SC crown has little or no value in the consider-
ation for invitations to the NCAA playoffs.

If Davidson’s schedule was not held back by the nec-
essity of playing SC teams. the ‘Cats could tackle real
powerhouse soccer teams and improve their recruiting
and chances for a playoff bid.

_ The same arguments could be presented for the ten-
nis team. Although the net season is somewhat longer than
those of other varsity sports, much of Davidson’s court
time is wasted playing conference teams.

A season free of the Southern Conference could great-

lv improve their chances for a national bid. and Harry |

Fogleman could easily become the first coach in David-
son’s history to win a national title.

There has been some question about how the change
to an independent status is going to affect South Carolina.
As has been shown this year, the Gamecocks have not
suffered, outside of minor scheduling problems, from the
rejection of their conference The USC football fared as
well as expected and /the ’Cock cagers face a stronger
and more diverse sea than ever before.

DAVIDSON COULD) BENEFIT GREATLY from the
move to indepen ~Fhe Southern Conference no jonger
meets the neéds of the Wildcats as a device for athletic or-
ganization, ahd Davidson needs to move to better hunting
grounds.

It is with these arguments thal we pick up the cry of

“Drop the SC! And, thank you South Carolina for the
example.
