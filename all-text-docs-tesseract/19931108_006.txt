The Week in Washington :
High noon time: Gore vs. Perot

By Brett Marston

Load up yoursix-shooter, Mr.
PEE-row, ‘cause it’s time for the
showdown. On a visit to New
York last week, President Clinton
announced Vice President Gore’s
challenge to Ross Perot to debate
NAFTA on Larry King Livein two
weeks, days before the crucial
House vote which will determine
the fate of the accord.

“The Vice President has chal-
lenged [Perot] toa debate on Larry
King,” Clinton announced to re-
porters in New York, according to
the New York Times. “Let’s see if
he takes it.”

Perot immediately accepted,
and countered with an offer to de-
bate on three separate occasions.
The Clinton administration replied
by insisting on just one meeting in
Larry King’s television studio.

With just a few days to go
before the House vote on Nov.
17th, NAFTA’s proponents look
worried. The House Majority Whip
David E. Bonoir (D-Mich.), has
gathered nearly enough votes to
defeat the agreement, and the Presi-
dent needs 50 new votes for the
agreement if it is going to pass.

Where does Ross Perot fit in?

First of all, it is this paranoiac
billionaire with a history of messi-
anic fantasies who has spearheaded
a major offensive against the ac-
cord in rallies and meetings across
the country and with his recent

book, Save Your Job, Save Our
Country: Why NAFTA Must Be
Stopped—Now!, co-authored with
Pat Choate.

The essence of Perot’s argu-
ment against NAFTA is contained
in the following excerpt, printed in
the Congressional Quarterly:
“Buried in the fine print [of the
agreement] are provisions that will
give away American jobs and radi-
cally reduce the sovereignty of the
United States.”

Critics, most notably U.S.
Trade Representative Mickey
Kantor, whose office recently pub-
lished a detailed refutation of
Perot’s arguments, have charged
Perot with falsifying figures in or-
der to bolster his claims.

Secondly, in the 1992 presi-
dential elections, Perot received as
much as one-third of the votes in
some districts, and most of his fol-
lowers still support him. Many law-
makers who face re-election next
year may wish to be cautious about
alienating this large block of vot-
ers, especially in light of recent
election results in some. states,
where voters have shown disap-
proval of incumbents and the
Democratic Party.

Much of Perot’s supportin the
presidential race came from areas
which support NAFTA, however,
andsome people in Perot’s organi-
zation favor the agreement.

Why, then, the debate?

NEWS.

Some commentators claim
that the Administration’s goal for
the proposed debate is to discredit
Perot, who, when recently asked a
question about his specific plans to
reduce governmentspending, com-
plained that he “would have
brought his note cards” if he had
known about that question.

Noting Perot’s skill at speak-
ing in emotional phrases tailored
to the size of a sound-bite, how-
ever, many commentators fear that
Vice President Gore will be no
match for Perot. “The very first
danger is a live audience,” wrote
William F, Buckley in his syndi-
cated column this weekend, “for
the simple reason that Gore is not
funny, and he is not a polemical
swordsman whose slashes and
whirls can bring down the house.”

One thing is certain, however.
Regardless of the outcome of this
latest round in our talk-show de-
mocracy, the big winners of the
debate will be neither Gore nor
Perot, but Larry King, who can
expect ratings that are even higher
than usual, and the edvertisers,
whose commercials will reach an
even larger audience.

The unwritten headline on the
day after the shootout will be:
NAFTA debate scathing, sales of
Aquafresh up by one third.

Puerto Rican referendum
to determine island's future

By Jay Jennings

Puerto Ricans all over the
world are looking to November
14, because there will be a
plebiscita, or referendum, to de-
cide the fate of the country. The
people will decide whether they
want Puerto Ricoto become astate,
an independent country, or remain
a Free State Association.

Jorge Pardo, the only
Davidson student whostill lives in
Puerto Rico, hopes that the refer-
endum will keep things the same.
He feels that Puerto Rico will “lose
its identity” if it becomes a state.
Puerto Rico would lose its unique
status of Free State Association.

Some fear that it would lose
notonly its identity, but also Span-
ish as its official language. When
other states, such as Louisiana,
Oklahoma, Arizona, and New
Mexico, joined the United States,
they were forced to adopt English
as their official language. Puerto
Ricans want desperately to retain
their culture and the Spanish lan-
guage and retain the “best of both
worlds” in between independence
and statehood.

Serbian hold on Kosovo

By Peter Varney

Six hundred and four years
ago, on the battlefield of Kosovo
Polje, the Serbian army was van-
quished by the Turks, putting an
end to the medieval Serbian Em-
pire. Six centuries later in June
1989, before a crowd of about one
million Serbs, President Slobodan
Milosevic announced that the re-
vered soil had returned to its right-
ful owners. Despite official
Serbian control, the province of
Kosovo, with its 90% majority of
ethnic Albanians, still remains a
potential hot spotin aregion riddled
with violence and bloodshed.

After the 1389 war, Kosovo
came under the control of the Otto-
man Empire. Over the next 500
years, most Serbs left Kosovo,
moving north. Replacing thé de-
parting Serbs, a large number of
Albanians settled in the area, con-
verting to Islam.

In the 1912-1913 Balkan
Wars, Serbia once again gained
control of Kosovo, with its largely
Albanian population. A numberof
these Albanians had fled to Turkey
by the 1940s. After the Second
World War, Kosovo entered the
Yugoslav Federation as a province
of the Socialist Republic of Serbia.

In 1974, anew Yugoslav Con-
stitution gave new rightsto Kosovo,
making it an autonomous part of
the Serbian Republic. Asa result,
the Albanian population once again
expanded, with Serbs and
Montenegrins exiting the region.

The election of Milosevic in
1987 began to spell trouble for the

stressed the tightening of Serbia’s
hold on the province. By 1989, the
Serbian National Assembly had

. passed constitutional amendments

revoking Kosovo’s autonomy. A
year later, in July 1990, the Serbian
government suspended Kosovo’s
parliament, and imposed direct rule
thorough the police force.

The Albanian institutions were
forced underground, but remain
active. The parliament declared
independence from Serbia in Oc-
tober 1991 and elected a president,
Dr. Ibrahim Rugova, in secret elec-
tions in May 1992. Rugova main-
tains a policy of nonviolence to-
ward the Serbs, hoping to gain
support fromthe United States and
Europe. He calls for the creation
of an independent neutral state in
Kosovo; which eventually could
merge with Albania.

Although Kosovo’s ethnic
Albanian population of 2 million
outnumbers its Serbian population
9 to 1, the Serbs outgun the
Kosovars “ten to zero.” As a re-
sult, the Milosevic government
participates in a subtle form of
“ethniccleansing,” using a combi-
nation of economic coercion and
terrorism to force Albanians out
of the region.

Since 1989, more than 130,000
Kosovars have been dismissed
from jobs in government, media,
schools, and hospitals. Many
Kosovars have also chosen to re-
sign positions in opposition to
Serbian oppression. The unem-
ployment rate among ethnic Alba-
nians has reached almost 80%, with

explosive, oppressive?

Kosovars. Rather than signing
pacts with Serbia, Kosovars have
established their own schools and
health facilities, financed through
donations from ethnic Albanians
outside of Kosovo.

The Albanian population must
face physical threats from the Serbs
as well. Beating of Kosovars by
police have become regular since
the tightening of Serbian control.
The Albanian Human Rights Coun-
cil Reports that an average of 190
beatings took place each month
since 1991.

The miliary occupation of
Kosovo, however, is the clearest
indication of its potential instabil-
ity. Tanks, armored personnel car-
riers, helicopters, and artillery
pieces are present alongside Alba-
nian farmers in traditional Muslim
garb. Pristina, the capital of
Kosovo, is an occupied city. The
streets are patrolled by submachine
gun-toting police officers, often
conducting ID checks of passers-
by. Yugoslav Air Force jets scream
at low altitudes.

Serbia’s primary stated goal
is to force the Albanians out of
theirhomesand land. Serbia would
like to relocate its 140,000 refu-
gees from Croatia and Bosnia in
Kosovo.

President Clinton has explic-
itly warned Serbia against provok-
ing trouble in Kosovo. Since
American interest in direct involve-
ment in the Balkans appears less
strong, the Milosevic government
regards Clinton’s words mildly.

Analysts suggest, however,
that Milosevicis much more likely

to wait until he has secured diplo-
matic recognition of his Bosnia
claims before any further action is
taken in Kosovo. If the conflict
breaks out between Kosovo’s Al-
banian and Serbian populations,
the war could quickly become a
regional entanglement.
Macedonia, with its 20 to 40%
Muslim population, has an interest
in the defense of the Kosovars.
Macedonia’s entrance could drag
in Greece, Bulgaria, and Turkey.
Kosovo has the unique poten-
tial to become the site of the worst
bloodshed to date in the Balkans.

The referendum has become
so important because the last elec-
tion was won by politicians who
support Statehood.

Thus, the governor of Puerto
Rico is trying to influence Puerto
Ricans to vote for Statehood. The
Governor has been implementing
new plans to deal with criminals,
which has led to much debate. The
status of Puerto Rico will decide
how issues such as crime are an-
swered.,

The people who want Puerto
Rico to become a full state hope
that it will put it on the same level
with the rest of the United States.
However, Puerto Rico already gets
most of the benefits of being a state
and at the same time keeping its
identity.

Many people do not realize
that Puerto Ricans are full United
States citizens. Thus they already
have the rights of Americans.
Puerto Rico takes a lot of pride in
its sports and it would have to give
up its National teams if it became
a state. Jorge Pardo takes pride in
the fact that the Puerto Rican Na-
tional basketball team finished
fourth in the last World nee
tion.

Jorge thinks that the referen-
dum will keep Puerto Rico’s status
the same. Puerto Ricans in the
United States have already voted.
According to Jorge, three-fourths
of the Puerto Ricans living in New
York City voted to keep Puerto
Rico’s status the same. This is
very important for the referendum,
because there are almost as many
Puerto Ricans in New York City as

- in Puerto Rico.

The referendum on Novem-
ber 14 has widespread ramifica-
tions. Many worry that the annex-
ation of Puerto Rico could finan-
cially burden the other fifty states.
The economic situation in Puerto
Rico is similar to that in southern
California. According to govern-
ment figures, if southern Califor-
nia was not included when econo-
mists gauge the U.S. economicsitu-

‘ation, indicators would show. that
. .the economy is actually growing.
