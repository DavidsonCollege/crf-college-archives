Gallery exhibits Bearden art collection

At the Spring Awards Con-
vocation on April 14, the dean
of America’s black:.artists Ro-
mare Bearden will receive an
honorary degree.

““He’s certainly the most
important artist we’ve ever
shown here at Davidson,” com-
mented Professor of Art, Herb
Jackson. Beardon’s exhibition
will be in the Davidson College
Art Gallery through May 5.

The exhibit includes 23 of his
pieces chosen from the period
1964 to the present. The exhi-
bition consists mainly of col-
lages.although there will be a
few silk screens.

Bearden did not develop the
collage fully into his style until
1964. From then on, it became
the basis of his work.

An article by Calvin Tomkins
in The New Yorker said, ‘“‘It
was as though Bearden had re-
invented collage, which became

in his hands the ideal medium .

for the transmission of all he
had learned as an artist and as a

man.

Bearden was born on Sept. 2,
1914, in Charlotte, N.C., but he
grew up in’Harlem. He spent
much of the Depression there
and durihg this time he got to
know many great jazz musi-

cians: Duke Ellington, Fats
Waller, Billie Holliday, Louis
Armstrong, and Jelly Roll Mor-
ton.. Their influence proved
great as he, himself, spent
several years writing music;
more importantly, they in-
fluenced his art.

In 1931, Bearden began stud-
ying at Boston University but
transferred after two years to
New York University. He grad-
uated there in 1935 with a
bachelor’s degree in science and
became a member of the Harlem
Artists Guild.

Through this association he
came t@ know such men as
Langston Hughes, Claude Mc-
Kay, William Saroyan, Bill
Steig and Carl Van Vetchen,
and musicians Andy Razaf,
Sammy Stewart, and John
Hammond.

The Harlem artists at this
time were being dominated by
social realism. According to The
New Yorker, Bearden’s early
paintings ‘‘were more lyrical,
and were concerned more with
plastic values than with social
themes.”’

It was also at this time that
Bearden was introduced to Af-
rican sculpture as well as Af-
rican and. Afro-American his-
tory. He visited an exhibition of
African Negro Art put on by the
Museum of Modern Art. The

New Yorker stated, ‘‘What
Bearden got from this exper-
ience was not racial pride so
much as a sense of the tremen-
dous formal power and majesty
of African art.”

These ideas were later incor-
porated into his collage paint-
ings.

In 1950, Bearden spent six
months in Paris and was then a
fairly well-established artist
with about six one-man shows
to his credit. While living in
Paris, he got to know other
artists also living there. These
included James Baldwin and
Richard Wright.

Bearden came back to the
United States in August, 1950,
and applied for a Fulbright
grant. He didn’t get it and sub-
sequently had problems start-
ing to paint again. He turned to
music, and over the next couple
of years he achieved some
success as a songwriter, record-
ing about twenty songs.

In 1954, Bearden was married
to Nanette Rohan and it was his
marriage that Bearden felt real-
ly gave him the strength to
return to painting. Ten years
later, he was to develop his
technique with collages which
now dominates his work.

In 1966, Bearden received the
National Institute of Arts and
Letters award. He has been

an international outlook.

‘‘An international outlook
means that people are aware of
the problems of the world,’’ said
Zimmermann. ‘‘Davidson is
trying to promote world con-
sciousness through such things
as the hiring of faculty and the
South Asian study program, for
’ example.”

The sixth criterion is ‘‘service
to the institution,’’ involving
support of faculty policies, par-
ticipation in committees, and
maintaining good relationships
with alumni, parents, trustees,
and others.

“Support of faculty policies
means that when the faculty
adopts a procedure or regula-
tion, all the members of the
faculty should support this. If
the faculty passed a regulation
and some members acted con-
trary to it, this would be an
uncooperative situation,” said
Zimmermann.

Spencer makes final recom-
mendations on these matters
involving hiring, renewal of
contract, and granting of tenure
to the trustees, who then act on
his proposal.

The President will normally
appoint the Vice-President for
Academic Affairs to work with
the department chairman in
gathering evidence and conduc-

According to Zimmermann,
“There is an attempt to be in
complete conformity with the
new by-laws which reaffirm that
Davidson is a church related
institution, having a Christian
commitment.”

The Enacting Statement pro-

vides that ‘‘a preponderant
majority of the teaching faculty
and administrative staff con-
tinue to be professing and
practicing Christians.’’ The in-
clusion of the phrase ‘‘in most
instances”’ in the section of the
evaluation draft dealing with
Christian commitment is de-
signed to express the ‘“‘prepon-
derant majority’ provision in
the Enacting Statement, ac-
cording to Zimmermann.
According to the proposed
draft, ‘‘the terms of the ap-
pointment (of a new professor to
the faculty) will include accep-
tance of the provisions of the
Davidson College Constitution,
including the Statement of Pur-
pose, in which Davidson
“recognizes God as the source
of all truth” and “sees Jesus
Christ as the central fact of
history, giving purpose, order,
and value to the whole life.”’
Other factors involved in the
fifth criterion are a vigorous

outlook as evidenced in physical .

vigor, skill in integrating ma-
terial in a liberal arts frame-
work, community service, and
ting investigations on which to
base an evaluation.

The evidence and opinions of
the department chairmen and
tenured members of the depart-
ment will play a role in the
evaluation process. They will be
consulted by the Vice-President
who will then’ pass his judge-
ments along to the President.

In decisions of tenure, un-
tenured faculty members will
not be directly involved be-
cause, stated Zimmermann,
‘the prevailing philosophy, as I
understand it, is that this puts

an unfair responsibility on un-
tenured faculty members. The
most disinterested are the te-
nured faculty members who are
not competitors:”’

“Student opinion is clearly
going to be an important part of
the evaluation process,’’ said
Zimmermann. The PAC and he
are in the process of investiga-

ting methods to gather student .

opinion and analyze the data.
Zimmermann feels that this will
likely be developed by next fall.

The draft’ sets ut the proce-
dures to be followed in the
evaluation process. In the case
of, tenure decisions, there is a
clause calling for a meeting
between the candidate and the
Vice-President in the initial
stages to insure that the candi-
date for tenure clearly under-
stands the evaluation precess.

The draft recognizes that
‘‘within any» group even of
highly successful teachers there
will be differing personalities,
differing intellectual bents, dif-
fering approaches and styles of
teaching--all of which, from the
standpoint of the experience of
the students, is highly desir-
able.”’

The document continues,
‘*hence, as with any process
involving human interaction, it
is inevitable and necessary that
judgments at Davidson will
contain a ‘subjective’ element.”’

“There are going to be sensi-
tive cases in the future, I am
confident,’'-said Wolf. ‘‘The
main point is that people will
know what the standards
against which they are mea-
sured are, and how those stan-
dards are going to be applied.”

demy and Institute of Arts and
Letters and the New York State
Council on the Arts. He was
chosen as a Guggenhein fellow
for 1970-71.

He has written two books
collaborating on each with one
other man. The books are The
Painter's Mind, published ‘in
1969, and Six Black Masters of
American Art, a book for young
readers.

Bearden, considered to be the
foremost black artist in Amer-

ica, has work aiaplived in the
Museum of Modern Art, the
Metropolitan, the Whitney, and
many other major museums and
galleries. His own gallery, Cor-
dier and Ekstrom Gallery of
New York, is lending Davidson
the works for the show here.

~ A reception will be held for
Bearden from 8 to 10 pm in
Chambers Art Gallery tonight.
1,000 invitations were sent out
but anyone is encouraged to
stop by, said Jackson.

National and world news

Europe reviews US

Denmark—During the recent
‘meeting of the European Eco-
nomic Community in Copenha-
gen, European leaders express-
ed concern over U.S. foreign
policy. While discussing such
issues as the declining value of
the dollar, SALT, and U.S.
energy policies, the leaders
criticized the U.S. for what they
termed its inconsistent and
insensitive foreign policy.

An economic summit meeting
between the U.S., Japan, and
the European Community is
scheduled for July 16-17 in
Bonn.

Lebanon—The first stage of
Israeli withdrawal from Sou-
thern Lebanon began Tuesday.
Israel is skeptical of the UN
troops’ effectiveness in main-
taining peace.

The UN policy to consider
Israel and the Palestinians as
equals, is greatly opposed by
Israel, who prefers the UN’s job
to be the prevention of the
PLO’s return to southern Leba-
non.

Meanwhile, the 220,000 Pale-
stinian refugees have begun to
return home as Israel with-
draws from southern Lebanon.

Africa—Transkei, the first
black homeland granted inde-
pendence by South Africa, has

broken relations with Pretoria,
and has expressed its support of
the movement for majority rule
in South Africa.

Transkei recieves two-thirds
of its present budget from
’Pretoria and supposedly hopes
to gain world recognition
through its actions. —

In Rhodesia, the interim mul-
ti-racial government expressed
its opposition to an ‘‘all-parties
conference’ supported by the -
Carter Administration, but did
not exclude the possibility of
future negotiations. Secretary
of State Vance plans to meet
with militant black leaders in
Tanzania sometime this week.

Washington—President Car-
ter’s decision to halt production
of the neutron bomb has stirred
up great controversy in the past
two weeks. Under great pres-
sure from Congress and our
allies, in particular West Ger-
many, the President softened
his stand, and decided rather to
“defer’’ its production.

This suspension is contingent
on favorable Soviet response to
SALT and to the reduction of
troops in Eastern Europe. Sec.
of State Cyrus Vance is sched-
uled to visit Moscow later this
month.
