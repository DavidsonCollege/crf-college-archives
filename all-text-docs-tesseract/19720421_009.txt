Wl Spe Sart

‘Believe me. It wasn’t easy there at
first to get started,” says David L.
Barker, Class of ’71 UNC—CH School
of Pharmacy. Dave has a family and a
good job. And the extra expenses of
getting established in his new town.
Then the car they had driven in col-
lege started to clonk out. That’s when
Dave had more expenses than cash.
But Dave was lucky. The very year he
graduated, First-Citizens Bank invent-
ed $uper $tart for people just like
him. So Dave got his new car. No has-
sle, and a preferred rate loan with a
delayed payment option.
