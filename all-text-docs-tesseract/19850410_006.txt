Inappropriateness Is Key To Thompson S Success

By STEVE MANK

- Richard Thompson’s dry voc-
als on “When the Spell is Bro-
ken,” are hardly appropriate
against the veil of delicately biting
stratocaster guitars. His banal
lyrics are equally inappropriate
given the subject matter—his own
divorce.

But Thompson has no need for
appropriateness. There’s no
reason why a song need multi-sy]-
labic words to be intellectual.
There’s no need for him to please
anyone but himself. Since he
began his career in the sixties with
the Fairport Convention he: has
made many critically successful
records, not one of which has pro-
duced a hit. He simply does not
make songs the way they should
be made.

None of the songs from the
new LP Across a Crowded Room

are great. All are simple numbers
that are at least a little depressing.
What they achieve is not success-
ful pop, but successful documen-
tation through words and music,
of Thompson’s feelings.

He seasons the songs taste-
fully with guitar work that boasts
all the understated flair of Mark
Knopflers.

Like a chemist, Thompson
mixes the maniacally wandering
guitars with a wary fretless bass
on “Love in a faithless country.”
The mixture bubbles and fumes
for a while until he adds the
catalytic drums which send it all
reeling upwards in a percussive
explosion. His lyrics are no less
mind-blowing—“Always move in
pairs and travel light/A loose
friend is an enemy, keep it tight/
Always leave a job the way you
found it/Look for trouble coming

and move around it/That’s the
way we make love.”

Songs like “Fire in the Engine
Room” are more rocking than
ones on previous albums. With
wailing guitar and vocals to
match, he takes the listener
through the dark underworld of
his mind without being the least
bit intimidating or pretentious or
self-indulgent.

Resentment and spiteful sar-
casm over his divorce do appear
occasionally, reaching their peak
in “She Twists the Knife Again.”
Here he laments that some un-
known she “Never leaves me/My
dignity.”

Richard Thompson’s tortured
psyche is not twisted as say Roger
Waters’ is. His victory is not in
translating his soul into the pop
medium, but rather in thrusting it
into the medium untranslated.

Editor Emeritus Declares War On Cigarette Machine

When you pass the cigarette machine on
the second floor of the Union, does it evoke
a character of trust and reliability? Lest any-
one be duped by that machine’s innocent
presence, I wish to expose the fraud that it
is. How appropriate that the thing sits right
next to the game room.

Punch Drunk

By DAVID McGEE

I wonder, however, if the Union Board
realizes that gambling and games of chance
are illegal in this state. That machine is the
most baffling puzzle I’ve ever worked.
Now don’t get the idea that I smoke. I fre-
quently buy cigarettes as a favor to — a
friend. \t struck me, though, that someone a
while back put an “Out-of-Order” sign on
the top glass panel. To the initiated, the sign
wasn't saying anything new. Has that
machine ever been “In Order’?

To date I have had several bouts with it,
and my tale is one of utter frustration —
often that thing has denied me the product I

have rightly paid for. And it doesn’t even
give correct change. “Tough,” you may

say, “if you want to smoke and rely solely
on that machine as your provider, then you
simply have to take the risks.” (The closest
places to get cigarettes are Food Lion and 7-
Eleven). Please, have sympathy. I mean,
coaxing that thing out of a pack of Marlboro
Lights is quite an assignment.

Remember the saying, “It’s not what
you say, but how you say it”? Well, in this
case, it’s not what coins you have, it’s how
you drop them. At a Coke machine, say in
basement Chambers, you just drop your
money in, and your drink just bounces
down, right? It’s different for the cigarette
machine. If there is any hope of success
with the cigarette machine, you had better
give your coins a good shove with a prayer.
(Oh, mighty silver one, the provider of the
sacred golden leaf, render to us your bles-
sings now in exchange for our mere pittance
of $80....)

Once, I had about $1.50 worth of
change in the machine — the bigger coins
had bounced. but the little ones kept disap-
pearing inside. I checked to see if the thing

was plugged in. The plug was half way in
the socket with one prong missing. I jiggled

_ it. The second prong broke. Having aban-

doned hope, I tried the Marlboro Light
lever. Down came a pack and my $.70

change. I didn’t ask why and left while the
leaving was good.

Several smokers I know were upset that
the Sloan Symposium on “Technology and
Freedom” a couple of weeks ago didn’t take
up the issue of reliable cigarette machines.
That machine is all we have, Davidson.
And it’s up to you to change it. I see no hope
of appeasing the mounting tensions among
smokers on campus should the appropriate
authorities fail to act. Try to borrow a

cigarette on campus sometime. If you are
suddenly jacked up by the collar and
threatened somewhat like this: “I’ve lost $4
in that machine this week! What's more, |
just wasted 10 minutes walking down to
Food Lion to get a pack. And you...
yooou! . . . have the gall to ask if you can
borrow one!” — have patience until David-
son gets reliable cigarette vending facili-
ties, just as many have hoped for years of
getting a new pool in the gym.
