Ihe DAVIDSONIAN, November 3, 1915

“SENIOR SPEAKING.”

Preparations for Senior Speaking are
now well under way and from present
indications the exercises this year will be
of unusual interest. There are nearly
fifty speeches to he delivered and the sub-
jects have already been handed in to Mr.
Frank Smith, class president. Invita-
tions have been ordered from the Everett
Waddy Co., of Richmond, and are ex-
pected here by the 15th of this month.
W. T. Witt, chief marshal, states that
the regalias have also been ordered from
the Horsemann Ca., of Philadelphia, and
that they are expected to arrive within
ten days.

SENIOR GIFT.

Each year the graduating class pre-
sents the college with a gift which is to
be a memorial to the class and one that
will ornament the campus and be of
some practical use to the students.

This year a committee appointed by
the president of the class of '16 is at
work trying to solve the problem in_re-
gard to the nature of the present, and it
is safe to sav that when it is placed in
the hands of the college it will be one
that will do honor to the class of '16.

LECTURE ON WHISTLER.

Before a small but appreciative audi-
ence, Dr. W. L. Hill, a North Carolina
poet, gave a most interesting lecture on
“Recallections of Jas. McNeill Whis-
tler.” on Monday night. the 25th. Dr.
Hill came to Davidson at the invitation
of the Blue Pencil Club, which is en-
deavoring to bring before the student
body a series of lectures on literary and
allied subjects. At the conclusion of the
lecture, Dr. Hill read some of his own
poems, which showed real merit, and
were much enjoyed.

CAROLINA SECRETARY

(Concluded from page 1)

few sleepy moments at night tends to be-
come mechanical, while prayer in the
morning when the mind is fresh and un-
occupied is real. “The Morning Watch
helps a man through the day; it draws
him nearer to God, it helps him over-
come temptation, and it makes him
strong.” Prayer blesses him who prays
and all those about him. It makes a
man an influence for good and against
evil. Finally prayer is the source of
power from above and the only source.
The Morning Watch must be regular.

The talk was made very impressive
and clear by a large number of apt illus-
trations and analogies.

MRS. JOHN F. CALDWELL.

It was an occasion of great grief to her
many friends and relatives when Mrs.
Ela Sloan Caldwell died last Wednes-
day, the 27th, at her home on Concord
street. Death came after a long illness
of about seven weeks, in which Mrs.
Caldwell suffered greatly.

She was a daughter of the late James

Lee Sloan, Sr., of this city, a man of
prominence and a large land owner. In
December, 1878, she was married to Mr.
John F, Caldwell, residing in this city.
’ Mrs, Caldwell was an invalid during
the latter years of her life, but she re-
tained an interest in the affairs of the
church and of the community at large
and was always devoted to her husband
and children. She was for years a mem-
her of the Presbyterian church of this
place; a. woman of sterling qualities,
and a devoted wife and mother,

The funeral servicds were conducted
last Thursday morning, followed by in-
terment in the local cemetery.

Mrs. Caldwell is survived by her hus-
band, and three sons: Roy Caldwell, of
Davidson; Gregg Caldwell, of Hickory;
and Harry Caldwell, of Davidson. She
is also survived by her sister, Mrs.
Samuel Cowan, and her brother, James
Lee Sloan, of Davidson.

The entire community extends sym-
pathies to the family in its sad bereave-
ment.
