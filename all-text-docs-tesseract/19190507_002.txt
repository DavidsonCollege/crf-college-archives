YOUR MOTHER'S DAY.

Our National Government is the first
in the world to set aside a day in cach
year to the honor of “The Best Mother
Who Ever Lived.” the mother of your
heart.

Several years ago a young Philadel-
phia woman thought of such a day to
“honor and uplift motherhood” and give
happiness to the best friend we will ever
have. Through the untiring efforts of
herself and her friends a resolution was
passed by Congress making ‘Mothers’
Day” a national day.-

In 1914, President Wilson issued the
first public proclamation and ever since
this official recognition we have been
gladly celebrating our Mothers’ Day by
wearing a flower and by doing some
other distinct deed of kindness as writing
a letter, sending a gift or by visiting her,
or if she sleeps by paying some fitting
tribute to her memory.

One of our alumni while in college
wrote a very significant poem on “Moth-
ers’ Day.” He said:

“T wear a rose on Mothers’ Day,

And she seems so near, tho far away.
For in its spotlessness I see,

My mother’s matchless purity.

And all its fragrance, soft and rare,

My mother's sweetness doth declare.
The rose’s beauty then unfold,

And half my mother's is not told.

I wear the rose above my heart,

For mother owns of me that part.”

The DAVIDSONIAN, May 7, 1919

ON SUNDAY MORNING
There will be a Aower in the library

parlor for every Davidson man to wear

[in honor of her, of whom some poet has

aid,

“None knew thee but to love thee,
Nene named thee but to praise.”

“ALOHA OF.”

As the great ocean liners leave Hono-
lulu: for the Orient or America, one is
‘timpressed with the sweet weird notes of
the native musicians as they play and
sing “Aloha Oc.”

Ina few days the train and bus will
he carrying you away. We will not-sing
to you as the little brown folks on the
docks at Honolulu but we will give you
a hearty handshake and a friendly fare-
well before you leave.

As one has said, “Why should we hesi-
tate to say ‘Good-bye’ to each other?
Are we not Pagans to think that a word
has power over God's quiet purposes, and
that saving ‘Good-bye’ smells of death?
Must men die intestate because they
think that making their wills is cutting
out their shrouds? 1f we were old Ro-
mans who thought ‘role’ meant ‘forever,’
we might be shy of such a word, but
‘Good-bye’ even if it should be for the
last time on earth, is only the difference
hetsveen ‘Good-night’ and ‘Good morn-
ing.’ Say it, then, like a Christian, and,
if it still comes hesitatingly, stretch it out
into the loveliest of wishes, ‘God be with
you!”

‘Vo the Seniors, we wish the best of
fortune for the coming years. Some of
you will continue your education in other
institutions, others in business. Wher-
ever you go, we wish you success. You
will leave, we hope, with the Greater
Davidson Spirit. May this spirit never
leave you and may the memory of friend-
ships ‘Formed at Old D.C." be ever
fresh in your minds.

To you, classes of '20,'21 and '22, we
wish a pleasant summer. And when the
leaves begin to fall and your thoughts
again turn to the old campus, see if you
can't persuade your younger brother or
chum that Davidson: is the place for
him. When you both arrive we will be
ready’ for you.

To you all The Davidsonian wishes a
pleasant summer and successful future.
We bid you all good-bye “But not for-
ever.”

STAY FOR COMMENCEMENT.

There. was duce a time when Com-
mencement was a great event at David-
son, ‘The student body, practically to
a man, remained over for the Com-
mencement exercises. There were large
crowds of visitors. Many occasions of
interest were witnessed and enjoyed by
the visitors and students,

‘Today, and for the last’ fifteen years
ot more, the students have been leaving
as soon as they finish their last exam-
ination, in some cases they would omit
even the examinations. This year the
prospects for a great commencement are
the brightest in years. There are a
number of classes holding reunions—
classes that finished years ago. It is in-
deed an interesting sight to see the men
of twiddle age, and older men, celebrate
reunions by giving their class yells—
and by showing the same spirit and
“Pep” that they had when they were stu-
dents here. They will be here this year
by a large majority. Letters are being
received every day that indicate this.

Beside the real enjoyment that one
receives from the commencement pro-
gram, and the people that will be here
—it is the duty of the students to be
here to welcome the returning alumni
and friends.

1f you ever stay once, you will want
to stay again. The speeches, lectures

and entertainment will be the best this
sear than in years.

Every student therefore is urged to
stay for this commencement, to help
welcome and entertain the visiting
alumni and friends and to make the
commencement of Davidson College
mean what it once meant. Be loyal to
he college, to the visitors and to the

Senior Class—and STAY.

SAVER WORKS FOR

AMERICA.

EVERY

“The war made citizens of many of
us—workiag citizens, willing to work
for the Government and willing to put
money in it. Millions of young inves-
tors in the schools of America lent their
money to the Government. “These boys
and girls belong to the class that counts
—the class,of working citizens,

You who bought ‘Thrift Stamps and
War Savings Stamps can say when the
story of the war is told, “I was a part
of it, a working part.” You — today
have a stake in your Government, You
own a little bit of America. You are
partners in the great business of run-
ning this country.

While our troops were at the front
every ‘Thrift Stamp counted towards a
bullet. Now that our men are coming
home the Government needs you as a
working citizen quite as much as dur-
ing the war. It asks you to keep right
on saving and lending, to see the ad-
venture through.

There is much still to be paid for,
but more, far more, to plan for and
build for. The “Great Adventure for
Democracy” still lies before us—the
democracy of a better opportunity for
alf, of happier lives, and a more pros-
perous people.

You are needed in the building of
this new America. In fact, it cannot
be built without you, you furnish the
material and are the material.

Every dollar you lend the Govern-
ment speeds up the work. Every dollar
you save teaches you how to save. If
you can hald on to the dollar that is
in your pocket you can do many things
you wish and have: many things ” you
wish, You will be worth much to your-
self and more to your country.

Twenty million young citizens who
have learned to buy wisely, learned to
set aside something for the — future,
learned preparedness for the golden op-
portunities that await them—these are
the foundation stones of the greater
America that all of us hope to build.

So held to your Savings Stamps,
keep the ‘Thrift cards growing. ‘Stay
with your country. ‘The “Great Ad-
venture” lies all before you. ‘Keep
your faces to the rising sun.”
