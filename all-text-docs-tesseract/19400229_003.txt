officially deferred until the June

172 Candidates

No small task has faced this com-
mittee. A total of 172 names were
suggested by various parties inter-
ested in the college. The commit
tee has investigated.and considered
a large number of these mén.

Members of the committee are: J.
Archie Cannon of Concord, chair-
man; Irwin P. Graham Green-
ville, S. C.; Smith Richardson of
New York; Rev. A. A. McLean of
Lenoir; Rev. Walter Goodman of
Kannapolis, and Dr. R. A, Dunn
of Charlotte. ;

Athletic Association

One of the most: important ac-
tions of the board was the disband-
ing ofthe Athletic Association,
placing: its activities under direct
faculty and trustee control. A stand-
ing committee on physical educa-
tion advised the step.

The Athletic grew
out of the fact that athletics were
originally started and managed by
students. When athletics at David-
son continued to grow, faculty aid
was solicited and the organization
ofan Athletic follow-
ed.

Members of the committee on
physical-education felt that hand-
ling athletics under a separate org-
anization was an unwieldly set-up.
Accordingly, the following, recom-

meeting the

“Birthright” Is
Vesper Topic

Dr. Richards Warns Students
To Keep Heritage

Using the theme of the mess of
pottage as his text, Dr. C. M. Rich-
ards of the Bible department spoke
at vespers on Sunday evening, Feb.
2a;

Dr. Richards
15:16, “Lest there be any profane
Esau, sold his
birthright for one mess of pottage.”
He the birthright
the Davidson college
rather than the birthrights of the
student,
was the national daYeef prayer for
schools and colleges.-__

Birthright of Freedom

The birthtights ofall Davidson

students are freedom, by this he

chose Hebrews

as who

considered of

students of

individual since Sunday

meant self mastery, honesty in
everything, purity of fife, good
citizenship, trained mitids, leader-
ship in the church, and partner-

ship with Christ. These—birthrights,
he said, could be easily sold for the
of of strong drink,
cheating breaking ‘rules,
courses, irreverent
profanity for holy

mess pottage
to
easy

and

pass,
selecting
worship,
things.

The blame for these poor ex-
changes was placed on the lack
of relative evaluation. To illustrate
this he used.the parable of Dr.
Lingle’s eyes.

Profanity Scored
Profane, he explained means un-

fenced. Esau’s soul was as an un-
fenced field. He compared the
building of character with the
building of a worm fence: The
basic structure, which was the
hardest part, was laid by our par-
ents before we came to—college.
Whether or not -we continue to

build and become complete or whe-
ther we will destroy,the founda-
tions and become profane as Esau
became depends upon us.

particularly “those “men who

Genesis,

Dr. Brown pointed out that if
