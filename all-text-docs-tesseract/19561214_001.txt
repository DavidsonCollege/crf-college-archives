Fraternity Court, center of Davidson social life since 1927, now faces possible replacement in the face
of presently overcrowded houses and the prospects of an enlarged student body in the next few
years. Still in the planning stage, the new fraternity center would possibly be located in the area

north of the tennis courts.

Others had rented rooms in town
and had them suitably furnished
for recreation and chapter meet-
ings. However, all fraternities
found their housing unsatisfactory,
and there was continual complaint
to the College for some improve-
ment of the conditions.

Without doubt, the Davidson fra-
ternity system faced a crucial turn-
ing point. Many felt quite strong-
ly that each fraternity should be
allowed to build its own house
somewhere off campus. Dr. J. M.
McConnell, then Dean of Students,
agreed with this group and worked
to have such a system approved.

The Board of Trustees finally
decided on the court system, and
construction was begun in early
1928 on eleven houses, designed
by Mr. M. E. Boyer, Jr., of Char-
lotte. The housés were ‘built at
a eost of approximately $5,500
each. All eleven houses, though
differing in appearance, were de-
signed to have equal floor space.
The court was completed in the
late summer of 1928.

Deciding which fraternity was to
occupy which house presented
quite a problem. The question was

The houses were financed by the
use of endowment money. The
court is actually an investment of
the college and as such has been
returning a respectable yearly pro-
fit to the college since 1928. This
profit is realized from the $475
annual rent payed to the college
by each fraternity.

There were ten fraternities on
the. campus when the court was
built. The eleventh house was built
to take care of any future in-
crease in that number. The fra-
ternities of 1928 had an average
membership of twenty-eight men,
including brothers and pledges.
This is in contrast with the pre.
sent day situation when it is not
uncommon for fraternities to have
more than sixty members.

In recent years, many Southern
colleges have modeled their fra-
ternity housing plans on the Da-
vidson system. The most recent
adoption of the Davidson plan has
been by Wofford College. which
has just completed construction
on its campus of an almost exact
replica of the Davidson fraternity
court.

Barium Springs Children

Davidson College students were hosts on Thursday eve- ities as Al Cohn, Stan Getz, Flip
ning to approximately one hundred and twenty children from’ philips. and Bill Perkins received
the Presbyterian Children’s Home at Barium Springs, N. C.

The annual occasion, sponsored
by the Interfraternity Council, be-
gan at 5:30 P. M. when fraternity
representatives met the children
who ranged in age from four
through fifteen. Approximately
twelve children were in each age
group which actompanied the fra-
ternity representatives to their
respective boarding houses for
supper.

Following supper the children
re-assembled with their sponsors
in the ballroom of the College
Union. After several cartoons had
been shown, the Male Chorus led
the entire assembly in the singing
of familiar Christmas carols. The
chorus and quartet also entertained
with selections of their own,

The highlight of the evening was
the time the children spent visiting
in the seasonally decorated fra-
ternity houses. Traditional games
and activities occupied everyone's
attention until the appearance of
Santa Claus, who distributed pres-
ents, candy, fruits, and nuts. The
activities closed with the college
boys serenading the children as
they boarded the buses returning

Gift Fund Extended
As Drive Misses Goal

Davidson students have contri-
buted $1903.06 to the Christmas
Gift Fund as of December 12. One-
hundred and eighty dollars has
been contributed by sources out-
side the college. “This total is ap-
proximately one-half of that expect-
ed,” said Bunny Perkinson, chair-
man of the Gift Fund Committee.

Perkinson went on to say, “We
are certainly disappointed in the
poor showing that the student
body has made. At the onset of
the drive, it looked as if the fresh-
men were lagging behind, but now
the upperclassmen have joined
them and are lagging behind too.
Because of the lack of support,
we have had to extend the drive
thrée extra days.”

Drive Chairman Urges
Support of Seal Sale

Hugh Sapp, chairman of the lo-
cal Christmas Seal Sale, yesterday
reminded Davidson students that,
they could save postage by turn-
ing in their dollar for seals to
him.

Sapp stressed the importance of
contributing to this drive.

Mr. Albert MeClure, Davidson

Home, expressed his appreciation
to the Interfraternity Council and
the Davidson College student body
for “one of the most enjoyable
Christmas parties we've ever had."

Hungarian Family Is
Difficult to Secure

Communication has _ recently
been made with the officials of
Church World Servie at Camp Kil-
mer in New Jersey. They. related
that the effort to secure a Hun-
garian family to be brought to Da-
vidson is being continued.

With Hungary locked in an al-
most total strike, the large number

refugee problem. However, it was
explained that ninety-eight percent
of the people fleeing from Hun-
gary are single men.

In light of this situation, the
Church World Service suggested
that there is a great need to help
particularly those young students
leaving Hungary. They proposed
that contact be made with World
University Service in an effort to
investigate the possibility of get-
ting such a student. The World
University Service has set up an
orientation course for these stu-
dents to prepare them for college
work in this country.

ham, “Our plans are still very in-
definite, but at the present, Mrs.
Cunningham and I are thinking
about a trip abroad.”

When asked what precipitated
this action of the Board of Trus-
tees, Dr. Cunningham replied, “For
the past several years it has been
my ¢ustom to take a few weeks off
from my duties in the late sum-
mer and then again in January.
These vacations are of such dura-

dence.
“With this in mind, the Com.

that Mrs. Cunningham and I get
away from the college responsi-

to find a convenient time for such

However, it does look like I might
find time to leave after the
February meeting of the Board of

Dr. Cunningham mentioned that
plans for administrative responsi-
bilities during his absence were
still indefinite. He also noted that
the nature and destination of his
trip were still being planned.
