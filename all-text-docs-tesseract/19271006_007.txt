Five local chapters of the Davidson
College Alumni Association held meet-
ings within one week of each other, be-
ginning on September 23rd, and ending
on September 3joth. This series marked
the beginning of the alumni meetings,
which the home office is planning for
forty cities or ‘districts this year,-and
which more than doubles the number
which were organized, re- organized, and
began more active work last year,

These meetings covered a territory that
extended from North Georgia to the
southwestern coast of Florida, giving
many alumni opportunity to gather to-
gether, seventy-eght of them taking ad-
vantage of them, this number coming
from eighteen different cities or towns:
North and South Georgia, and all of
Florida but the southeastern coast were.
included in these meetings.

The SGNF (South Georgia-North Flor-
ida) Association, organized at Thomas-
ville, Ga., during the Christmas holidays,
met at Bainbridge, Ga., on September
23rd. The Atlanta organzation, which
has been in existence for many years, and
which also met and started more en-
thusiastically last Christmas, met on Sep-
tember 27th, and the following new or-
ganizations were perfected on succeeding
nights: Northeastern Florida at Jack-
sonville; Central Florida at Orlando, and
Florida West Coast at St. Petersburg.

At all five of the meetings telegrams
of greeting, best wishes and the assur-
ance that the college was behind its
alumni, were read from Dr. W. J. Martin,
president of Davidson, the associations
at Bainbridge, Atlanta and Orlando ac-
knowledging these, expressing their ap-

preciation and pleasure over the progress |

of Davidson. At Bainbridge a wire was
also received and acknowledged from
Dr. J. M. MacConnell, and at the same
meeting, a letter was read from the Alum-
ni Secretary.

A new feature at the meetings this year
is the singing of “O Davidson” and “Col-
lege Ties.” Music is sent out ahead for
the former, while copies are either sent
or carried to all of the meetings. This
has enlivened the meetings, made them
peppier, and apparently has created more
interest and brought the alumni closer
together.

Because of their location, the four as-
sociations at Bainbridge, ‘St. Petersburg,
Jacksonville and Orlando were partti-’
cularly ¢oncerned with the approaching
football game between the Davidson
Wildcats and the University of Florida
’Gators, and it always came in for a
share of the discussion. The Jackson-

ville and Orlando groups wire messages

Delegate to Atlanta

Assistant Secretary Will Attend 3
Regional Conference This Week

Harllee Branch, Jr., Assistant Alumni
Secretary, leaves Davidsoh Friday night
for Atlanta, Ga., to attend a Regional
Conference of the American Alumni
Council, which will meet at the Ansley
Hotel in the Georgia city Saturday, the
sessions to begin early in the morning and
last through the entire day.

At the spring meeting of the American

Alumni Council, held at Chapel Hill, it|

was decided to have this conference, the
date to be later decided by a committee,
with R. E. Thigpen, Alumni Secretary
and president of this district, acting in
charge. Alumni problems in southern
colleges differ from those of a national
nature, and to properly and intimately
discuss these matters, the meeting Sat-
urday was deemed advisable. ;
According to the prograt, which has
been received in the alumni office here,
those attending will have ample oppor-
tunity to get many new ideas, and to lis-
ten to experienced men, Among the most
notable will be Wilfred B. Shaw, Alumni
Secretary of the University of Michigan,

and who has become nationally knownas |

the “Dean of Alumni Secretaries,” Mr.
Shaw’s work at Chapel Hill being of
prominence.

Among other alumni secretaries, or
those connected with alumni work, who
will appear on the program are Miss
Polly Stone, Agnes Scott; Miss Clara
Byrd, N. C. C. W.; A. J. Hanna, Rollins
College; Tyre Taylor, University of North
Carolina; W. H. Wraneck, Universty of
Virginia; V. B. Kemp, Washington and
Lee; Miss. Jennie Loyall, Wesleyan Col-
lége, and R. J. Theissan, Georgia Tech.

“Ask Me Another” on the program is
where new ideas will be obtained, and
problems_discussed in detail.

O. D. K. SPONSORS TAP. DAY

to the entire organization but has been inau-
gurated by several other circles. Omicron
Delta Kappa was organized at Washington
and Lee College in 1914 and has had such
success in so short a time that it is now a
national organization and comprises about
34 circles. The Delta Circle of Davidson
College was founded in 1917, only three years
after O. D. K. came into existence.

The present members of O. D. K. are
Boyce Martin, H. M. Arrowood, C. F. Mc-
Rae, W. O. Nesbit, W. R. Grey, F. C. With-
ers, W. L. Lingle, together with 11 faculty
members and Coaches Younger and Mattox.
This enrollment will be increased by about
five members of the Senior class on bid day.
Shortly after Tap Day the public and private
initiations will occur. The circle always pro-
vides speakers of excellent merit for the
occasion, to which both the students and
townspeople are invited.

APPRECIATION

In this manner I would like to
publicly express my sincere appre-
ciation to every alumnus of David-
son College who attended the five
recent meetings of local alumni as-
sociations. Particularly; would I
like to express my thanks to those
who so diligently and faithfully
made the preliminary arrange-
ments, taking valuable time from
their business, and perhaps work-
ing over-time in reaching alumni. -

It has been a pleasure to meet you
personally, and to accept your c r-
dial hospitality, but a greater pleas-
ure would be to greet you at Da-
vidson—on Homecoming Day, Octo-
ber 2oth, at commencement in
June, or at any other time that you
may be able to visit the campus.

Cordially yours,
ERNEST MILTON,
Alumni Secretary.
