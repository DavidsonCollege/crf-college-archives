Xerox Company To Present

American History Survey

A probing. sensitive and
sometimes amusing look at the
United States, from the first
Indian settlements to the pre-
sent, will be brought to Ameri-
can television audiences by
Xerox Corporation this year in
a series of 13 hour-long pro-
grams.

Created, written and narrated
by Alistair Cooke, who has been
interpreting this country to his
oative England for more than
a quarter of a century, the ser-
ies is entitled ‘‘America: A Per-
sonal View.” It is tentatively
scheduled to begin next Septem-
ber over a network of commer-
cial stations and at a time to
be announced.

The series is a co-production
of the British Broadcasting
Corporatico and Time - Life
Films. lt is being produced by
virtually the same BBC team,
including executive producer
Michael Gill, which filmed Lord
Clark's highly-acclaimed ‘‘Civ-
‘lization’ series.

“Mindful of the approaching
200th anniversary of this na-
tion's founding,” said David J.
Curtin, Xerox vice president,
“nothing could be more appro-
priate than this magnificent
television series by Alistair
Cooke and the BBC.

“Gifted with rare insight, Mr.
Cooke cuts through the lesser
moments to get to the heart of
the American story; a millen-
nium of human experience and
world-shaking events crowded
into eight or ten generations.

“We lament its failings daily,
but how often do we stand tall
and sniff the greatness that is
America? It whispers through
this series like a welcome
breeze, made all the sweeter
because the films were produced
not here, but in a foreign land,
Iree from any sense of obliga-
lon to the United States.”

Cooke, perhaps best known to
American viewers as host of
the award-winning “Omnibus”
series, describes himself as an
Englishman who arrived in this
country in 1932 and promptly

“fell in love with its landscape
and with journalism.” He has
been translating the personal-
ities, attitudes and foibles of the
United States to British readers
since 1945 as chief correspcnd-
ent of the Guardian of England
(formerly the Manchester
Guardian).

For almost 25 years he has
also been talking about America
to BBC audiences around the
world in a weekly 15-minute
radio report.

“I've been appalled for the
past several vears at the im-
mense ignorance among many
Americans, particularly the
young, about American history,’
Cooke says. ‘Very often they
attack what they know nothing
about. Perhaps the time has
come to show them the best.
as well as the worst. of their
American heritage.

“I shall try to present in the

‘America’ series my _ personal
account of what is most excit-
ing and most siguificant.”

To prepare and film ‘“‘Ameri-
ca: A Personal View.’ Cooke
has been criss-crossing the
United States for almost three
years with the BBC production
crew. They have visited sites
from Concord, Mass., and Wil-
liamsburg. Va., to the Sierra
Nevada foothills and San Fran-
cisco.

As he wanders through these
places. Cooke describes the peo-
ple and events that shaped this
country, from Christopher Co-
Jumbus and his firs: sighting of
San Salvador, to the New Left
and the revolt of modern-day
Students against the so-called
Establishment.

“I hope this series will help
humanize some of America's
heroes and villains. and bring
histroy alive.” he says.

College Defended;

To The Editor:

“The positions which have
been won by acclamation are:

19 SGA offices for Tuesday’s
election for which only one can-
didate expressed an interest. In
addition no one at all register-
ed for the positions of Review
Board or Off-campus senator.

Out of over 1000 students at
Davidscu only 33 registered for
the campus elections and for
just over half the offices is
there even an election. Last
year only two offices were fill-

. ed by acclamation and one of.

System Disillusions Freshmen

Preliminary evaluation of a
senate subcommittee question-
naire indicates that the fresh-
man class finds the new social
system confusing and unwelcom-
ing... and that Davidson is
not coeducaticnal.

Freshman class senator Bill
Smith released the results of
the questionnaire, prepared and
distributed before Christmas.
Smith is chairman of the sen-
ate subcommittee preparing a
report on the situation on Pat-
terson Court.

The heaviest positive response
to the poll came on the issue
of physical arrangements. Over
75% of those responding indi-
cated that they favored the idea
of eating at a house for a solid
week as opposed to the pre-
vious policy which provided for
two meals a week.

‘The freshmen voiced a three
to one opinion that they them-

selves were making a good ef-

fort at harmonizing with the
system. Evaluation of the houses

was not as generous. Slightly

‘less than half of those return-

ing questionnaires felt. that the
members of the court were mak-
ing them feel at home. Just over
a quarter had unfavorable reac-
tions The missing 25 « had mix-
ed reactions. citing the differ-
erences between individual
houses.

Thirty-eight per cent indicated
that they would self select a
house, while 29% will not. Many
were still undecided stating that
they had not yet determined
the specific advantages of the
eating clubs as opposed to the
college union.

The heaviest negative respon-
se came over the issue of the
social system in general. Thirty-
seven per cent answered that
they were happy with the exist-
ing system while 45°< voted no.

Smith said, ‘It appeared that
the majority of those displeased
with the system liked the eat-
ing club arrangement — the
mechanical setup — but there
was a definite lack of social

activity for freshmen.

“There was a prolific write-
in vote for coeducaticn. The
implementation of coeducation
appears to be the only signifi-
cant step toward improving the
social system for many fresh-
men.”

In addition to the familiar
theme as_ coeducation. fresh-
men also charged a general lack
of adequate social activities.

On the positive side of the
ledger the responses were more
diverse. Many pointed to the
lack of social pressure, the self
selection procedure, and the
possibility of a wide circulation
among various houses.

Among the statistically less
frequent responses was that
“this way we can get Will Ter-
ry to come and speak cn our
hall.”

Another said that he hadn’t
gone out on his girl friend.

Monasteries are like that.

Smith indicated that the sta-
tus of the report and his com-

place before we will.

To The Editor:

Despite all the evil charac.
teristics Davidson is accused of
possessing, the school still man-
ages to uphold its reputation as
a progressive liberal arts school.

It took the class of ’74 some
two terms to figure out that
the slightest of our ills could be,
in some way or another, attri-
buted to this most accursed
school.

The class of '75 has made
great advances, succeeding in
doing the same thing in less
than two months, and even this
is not aS impressive as some
of the foreign students’ accom-
plishments, who have not only
determined the nature of the
school’s depravity, but have
done likewise with the entire
American culture within the
same time period.

However admirable I find
such decisiveness when work-
ing within so little time, I cam
not believe that the freshmen
have been totally corrupted
within two months.

If they are so affected by the
absence of girls within a two
month period, (even though I've
never noticed an absence, es-
pecially living around frustrated
football players on weekends),
I would suggest that they have
some serious Freudian sexual
hang-up, and now that the
freshmen are outside of the
company of their mothers, they
seek replacements in the guise
of matronly Queens girls, an
action doomed to failure.

Of course, I doubt that the
class of ‘75 is infested with peo-
ple with Freudian hang ups,
but instead are numbered by
people who are not very honest
with themselves amd seek any
excuse whatsoever to disguise
a failure on their part to ad-
just to the environment.

Admittedly, an all-male en-
vironment is not the optimum,
bui that it takes otherwise nor-
mal boys and converts them
into utterly destitute individuals
craving sex-objects is simply
nonsense, especially when the
conversion is to have happened
in the space of two months

I don’t know anyone here who
presently drools at Playboys and
**skinflicks’’ who in their high
school days placed the feminine
creature cu a pedestal totally
free from the “‘corruption of
earthly desires.”

A person who regards girls
as sex-objects now certainly did
before they came here, and the
absence of girls only accentuat-
ed these feelings.

The point is that we just are
not willing to assume full re-
sponsibility for our actions if
we seek to accuse the school or
our classmates for producing
our deficiencies. ;

Before a freshman transfers,
I hope he takes into considera-
tion the vulnerability of the
other school, so that: it may
provide him with a scapegoat
for future ailments.
