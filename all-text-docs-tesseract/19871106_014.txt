Scabs have fallen off: Back to the real NFL

By CARTER GARRETT
and ROB GRZESCZAK
The NFL is back. Although the
bad taste left in every true fan’s
mouth after three weeks of “scab”
games will linger for some time,
last Sunday’s games were played
and watched the way professional
football was meant to be.
But real games or scab games,
there are still some things around
the league that are wrong, and that

ferent tastes and preferences and
is bound object to different things,
but we’re almost positive that
everyone will be in total agree-
ment on the following points that
highlight the imperfections of the
‘National Football League.

Many games nowadays start off
on the wrong foot. In this we’re
referring to the “Budweiser Kick-
off,” an advertising ploy where

they can, why is Budweiser doing
it?

Assuming that the fan survives
this “Budweiser Kickoff” ordeal,
other things can soon disrupt the
normal viewing of a good ball
game, A lotof these things have to
do with the rules of the game
today, but others pertain to certain
teams, personalities, uniforms/
equipment, and even coaches’

have the ball on their own 20, and
Gary Hogeboom fades back to
pass. He zips one over-the middle
intended for the tight end, but it’s
deflected. A defensive back dives
for the ball, but comes up empty.
Why? Because the NFL outlawed
the use of stick-um, a disastrous
move. Let’s face it -- five years
ago that ball would have stuck to
Lester Hayes’ helmet for an inter-

an opponent whose helmet has
only one bar! Needless to say, the
punter misses the tackle.

Of course the Colts have some
troubles that other teams don’t”
have to worry about, sdch as ugly
team uniforms and a doméd sta-
dium with artificial turf. But a
sports fan is a sports fan, and even
though there were some things
wrong with the game he or she will

need to be changed. These are the

kind of things that detract from the °

enjoyment of the game -- you
know, the kind of stuff John
Madden hates. Everyone has dif-

surrounded by a red, obnoxious
Budweiser frame, and the fan is
more or less forced to watch. This
is ludicrous. How can a company
sponsor a kickoff? And, if indeed

,of these disturbing events, picture

an actual football game.

Adjust that picture slightly so
one of the teams is the Indianapo-
lis Colts. It’s first down, the Colts

Davidson volleyball shows its work
and commitment in tournament

By DAVID SCOTT

The 1987 Wildcat volleyball
team has featured promising per-
formances from many young
players. One such player cited by
Coach Rebecca Hawkins is fresh-
man Ellen Ott, whose outstanding
defense and passing skills have
earned praises. Having no seniors
and only a handful of juniors,
Hawkins is looking forward to
solid improvement as thé team
matures in the years to come.

Especially encouraging to
Hawkins is the positive response
the ‘Cats have shown in the face of
a difficult schedule. As a young
team lacking experience and
trying to compete in the tough
Southern Conference, the ‘Cats
have been overmatched through-

out the year. - Yet they have re-
fused to back down. Rather than
reaching a plateau in effort and
performance, the team is continu-
ing to improve even in the latter
__Stages of the season.

The team put in strong perform-

ances in a tough weekend of ©

matches against conference
members Western Carolina and
UT-Chattanooga, and non-con-
ference foe UNC-Greensboro.
Coach Hawkins was especially
pleased with the team’s perform-
ance against UNC-Greehsboro,
calling it their best performance of
the year.

The team played together as one
unit with each -individual doing
her part. The'team goals of main-
taining a90% serving average and

succeeding on over half of all
spiking attempts were both met.
Several players had 100% serving
nights and most had positive spik-
ing percentages.

With a solid all-around effort
and a vital lift off the bench from
sophomore Kathy MacDonald,
the team took a far stronger and
more experienced UNC-G team
the full five games.

As a result of hard work and
commitment, Wildcat volleyball
is likely to become a force to be
reckoned with in the -years to
come. With the withdrawal of
Davidson’s entire athletic pro-
gram from the Southern Confer-
ence, the ‘Cats are bound to see

some marks adding up in the win -

column in the near future.

gone crazy.

Butanyhow, wecome to second
down. Again Hogeboom fades to
pass, but his line collapses as the
defense is blitzes. As the rush
closes in, Gary gets hit and throws
up a wounded duck, which is
quickly picked off and returned
for ascore. But wait; Hogeboom
isruled“‘in the grasp,” theresult of
another terrible league rule. So
the Colts have another chance,
this time facing a third and long
Situation. They’ll operate from
the shatgun; there’s the snap, and
-- wait, they run the draw, gaining
seven yards and forcing a fourth
down punt.’ The crowd boos.
Doesn’t everybody hate it when a

team runs on third and long? ——-

The puntis a bad one, setting up
a chance for a good return. The
receiving team forms a good wall,
and suddenly the return man
breaks into the open: field, with
only one man to beat, the punter,
who happens to be in good posi-
tion to make the tackle. But the
return man is totally undaunted by

nears its end. The Colts are down
by ten with less than a minute to
go,and the other team has the ball.
Although there are probably a few
fanatically loyal fans in Indian-
apolis, most folks probably leave
right about now to beat the traffic.

This really isn’t a bad idea,
unless the opposing team’s coach
is Buddy Ryan.

Last week Buddy’s team was in
a similar position with the Dallas
Cowboys, and while pretending to
run out the clock, he suddenly
called abomb and then went on to
score. _

Buddy, that was unethical;
that’s worse than the “in the grasp
rule” or artificial turf, although
not quite as bad as'the “Budweiser.
Kickoff.”

With all the happiness and ex-
citement brought on by the return
of the regular players, it’s stuff
like Buddy Ryan’s ethics; punt-
ers’ helmets, and the Colts’ uni-
forms that serve as constant re-
minders that the NFL is not a
perfect world:
