NOBEL WINNER LASHES OUT
Martin Luther King Views ‘Two Americas’

“There are two Americas,”
Nobel Peace Prize winner .Mar-
tin Luther King Jr. told 7,000
people Wednesday night at. John-
son C. Smith University.

“One America is a beautiful
America, a prosperous Amer-
ica."’ But, he went on, there is
another America, an ugly Amer-
ica.

“It's the America of the poor,
of the disinherited., of the op-
pressed. And the vast majority
of the 22 million Negroes living
in America are in this second
America,”’ he said. *‘These peo-
ple, rather than having wall-to-
wall carpeting, have wall-to-wall
rats and roaches.”

Very few segments in Amer-

ican society escaped King’s con-
demnation for allowing such a
situation to exist. First he lash-
ed out at the obvious targets:
the Kv Klux Klan and the John
Birch Society, whom he labeled
a “type of klan that doesn’t
wear a hood.”

“don't know of any state in
the Union that should be more
familiar with the Ku Klux Klan
than North Carolina,” he quip-
ped to an approv:ng audience,
composed predominantly of mid-
dle-class Negroes. Approximate-
ly 100 Davidson students were
also there.

Then he tore into the less ob-
vious causes of the Negro’s lag-
ging. “I'm gravely disturbed

about the silence of the good
people, the people who believe
in order more than justice. who

ae

say to the Negro: ‘Wait’.

The other America is also per-
petuated by white politicians
and some Negro politicians more
concerned about self-aggrandize-
ment. Then. he said, there are
Negroes who have succeeded in
lifting themselves from the
slums and “have forgotten the
stench of the backwaters.”

“White ministers have taken
refuge behind stained glass win-
dows,” he said, ‘‘and there are
Negro ministers more concerned
about. the size of the wheelbase
on their autos.”

The racist doesn’t make an
empirical observation that Ne-
groes are restrained by their en-
vironment. King affirmed. **Rac-
ists are making an ontological
affirmation that Negroes are
created inferior, and the ulti-
mate logic of racism is geno:
cide.”

“If a man says to me that
I'm not good enough to live next
door to him, then he’s saying
that I deserve to be dead and
non-existent,"’ King shouted amid
applause that interrupted his
speech more than 20 times dur-
ing the night.

Once, he said, a reporter ask-
ed him if he didn’t think he

should try to align himself with
contemporary thought. In an ob-
vious dig at the President, he
replied, ‘I'm not a concensus
leader. I don’t decide what is
right or wrong by a Gallup poll.
I: try to be a molder of opinion,
not a follower.”

He went on: “If every Ne-
gro in the United States turns to
violence, I will stand by my-
self,” a statement that brought
tumultous applause.

Hate, he said, harms both the
hater and the hated.

“T've seen it on the faces of
too many Southern sheriffs, Ku
Klux Klansmen and men, wom.
en and children in Chicago. In

effect, I say to a man, ‘I'd rather
die than hate you,*°’ he said,
rolling his voice and raising his
hands.

King demonstrated a dual con-
cern, not only for social justice,
but also an escalation of the
War on Poverty. ‘The difference
between now and the past is that
we have the tools to fight pov-
erty now,” King said. “But I'm
afraid there are too many peo-
ple concerned with winning the
war in Viet Nam and not enough
with the War against Poverty.”

Everybody, white and Negro,
he said, must be involved in the
struggie to eliminate poverty,
because all are tied together.

foreign policy and American in-
volvement in Viet Nam.
Shallcross, addressing about
100 members of the Davidson
and Queens College Young Re-
publican Clubs in the Union. al-
so attacked his Democratic op-

| ponent, incumbent Sen. B. Ev-

erett Jordan.

Calling him a ‘‘rubber-stamp”’
for the Johnson administration.
Shallcross accused Jordan of
of leading the ‘whitewash’ of
the Bobby Baker case from his
position as chairman of a spe-.
cial investigating committee.

The senator, Shallcross claim-
ed, put the wishes of the admin-
istration before the best. inter-
ests of the people of North
Carolina and the United States.

Switching to the national gov-
ernment, Shallcross strongly
criticized current federal eco-
nomic policies. The continuing
inflation caused by these meas-
ures is “picking the pockets" of
the American people by causing
the devaluation of the dollar.

In 1980, he said, it will take
20 dollars to equal the purchas-
ing power of one dollar in 1940.

Fulbright Grants

The deadline for filing appli-
cations for grants under the
Fulbright-Hayes Act will close

Program Adviser Dr. J. 0. Em-
bry.

These U.S. government awards
are provided for graduate study

-fand research in 54 countries.

Each year approximately 850
grants are furnished as part of
the educational and cultural ex-
change program of the State De-
partment.

Those students who wisn to
| apply must be U. S. citizens,
have a bachelor's degree by the
beginning date of the scholar-
ship and. in certain cases, be
proficient in the language of his
host country. -

Johnson, Shalleross said, would
“raise the, roof. about a two-
dollar raise in the price of a
ton of steel, but would say noth-
ing about a 500 dollar raise in
the price of a ton of bacon.

He also attacked what he
called the give-away spending
of the government, in such
areas as the anti-poverty pro-
gram.

The United States, Shallcross
claimed, is following a ‘‘no-win"’
policy in Viet Nam. The hands
of the military have been tied.
and the war is being run direct-
ly from Washington.

The administration is planning
for a war that will last for from
four to 10 years, he said, and it
is ridiculous to spend almost
two million dollars an hour and
the Hives of American service-
men in anything less than an
all-out effort to win the war as
quickly as possible.

To do this, Shallcross recom-
mended giving more actual pow-
er to the military, and taking
measures that would harass the
enemy without increasing the
danger of escalation.

He endorsed the bombings of
North Vietnamese oil storage
depots, and suggested the block-

ading of the vital ports where
supplies are brought in.

Decrying the advance of so-
cialism in the national govern-
ment, Shallcross called some
legislation ‘‘diversionary  tac-
ties,” used by socialistic groups
to center all power in Washing-
ton. Pointing out the present
state of the British economy, he
blamed socialistic trends for
England's financial woes and
loss of world power.

On the specific question of
Medicare, he said that further
action should be postponed until
the effects of measures already
taken can be determined.

A businessman, civic aud
church leader, Shallcross re-
signed from his position as pres-
ident of an electronics firm to
devote all of his time to the
campaign.

COMING SPEAKERS

King used the Biblical exam-
ple of Dives, who refused to use
his riches to aid the beggar
Lazarus, tte prove his point.
“Dives went to Hell because he
became a conscientious objector
in the War against Poverty.”

Each person lives two lives,
King explained, within and with-
out. The within concerns man’s
internal goals, while the without
deals with the instrumentalities
by which man lives.

But the within has been ab-
sorbed by the without,"’ he af-
firmed, ‘morality by mentality,
theology by technology. We have
guided missiles and misguided
men.”
