Workman To Replace Hall
As Clinical Psychologist

By DAVID HANIG
Copy Editor

Meredith Hall, the college's
clinical psychologist, will be
replaced by Professor of
‘Psychology William G. Work-
man in the position of clin-
ical psychologist next year,
it, was announced recently,
promoting a mild student
protest movement.

“TI really appreciate the
support I’ve received but I
don't really enjoy being in
the middle of a controver-
sy,’ Hall said. ‘‘I have the
feeling that the administra-
tion sincerely wanted to keep
me here.

“T really liked being here.
I have no negative feelings
about my work here.”

Under the impression that
there would be no clinical
psychologist to replace Hall,
the SGA Senate passed unan-
imously a resolution Monday
night that said that there
was a need for “the vital
services of a clinical psychol-
ogist for next year, whose
only responsibility to the col-
lege is counselling.”’

Workman will teach one
course per term next year
and will be available the
rest of the time for coun-
selling. Dean of Students
Will H. Terry maintained
that ‘‘it will be advantageous
to have a counsellor on cam-
pus during the day and not
just one or two evenings a
week, as is the present
case,”

Terry said that Workman
“will be available for stu-
dent counselling just as Mr.
Hall was, and the same con-
fidentiality will be maintain-
ed along with the same op-
crational procedure as_ be-
fore.

“Dr. Workman served in
this capacity on a very lim-
ited basis but successfully
until three years ago when

his teaching load required
him to give up. this fune-
tion.”’

Controversy arose last week
when it was learned that
Hall’s contract would not be
renewed. According to an
unidentified senator, the sen-
ate suspected that a mem-
ber of the psychology de-
partment would be named to
fill Hall's position.

“If he taught any cours.
es, that would be next -to
nothing because the only
people who would go to see
him would be psychology ma-
jors eager to get those good
old brownie points,’’ the sen-
ator said.

The Pi Kappa Phi house

will be in the hands of a

group of about sixty fresh-
men next year, according to
Dean of Students Will H.
Terry.

In accord with the offer
of the new social system,
the group put in a request
for a: house with the admin-
istration. In the midst of dis-
cussion, several houses on
the fraternity court asked
the group to join with them
and the Pi Kappa Phi house
was decided upon,

“The final agreement,”’
said Terry, ‘‘was that the
freshman group would be
given a house in exchange
for allowing the present
members eating at the house

‘to remain there as a group.

‘“‘We were very impressed
with the ingenuity of this
freshman group, and we see
it as a positive response to
the new social system.”

Terry added, ‘‘We realize
the dangers of this situation
for the future and will seek
to deal with these as fairly as
possible next year.”

Reaction to Hall's dismiss-
al among the student body
has been strong. A_ poster
placed on the Wailing Wall
in the College Union last Sun-
day implied that the admin-
istration is more interested
in obtaining alumni funds
than in the mental health of
the student body.

“We really need a guy to
help the students with their
problems around here,’ one
student said. ‘‘When the ad-
ministration gets rid of the
guy we have now for finan-
cial reasons,’ dnd then turns
around to hire another guy
to get alumni money, that
really hurts."’

ship, but they organized and
spread their invitation
through the- grapevine until
thé ranks swelled to a size-
able number.

Final consent for the
house came from the Stu-
dent Life Committee, which
has also given ‘tentative ap-
proval” to two other requests
from groups interested in
taking over the Sigma Phi
Epsilon and Phi Gamma
Delta houses.

All of these groups with
requests are still subject to
the self-selection program
until the maximum number
of eighty members is reach-
ed in a house.

According to Terry, any
group may make a request
for a house, as stipulated in
the provisions of the Com-
mittee of Eighteen. Terry
predicts that six to nine
houses on Patterson court
will be in operation at the
beginning of next year.

On . Wednesday, Vice-pres-
ident for Academic Affairs
John M. Bevan invited rep-
resentatives from four hous-
es which tentatively are plan-
ning to go off campus next
year to a meeting to discuss
the feasibility of such a
move.

Representatives from Kap-
pa Alpha and Sigma Phi Ep-
silon showed up, but Sigma
Chi and Phi Delta Theta did
not attend.

Bevan confronted the group
with a recent U.S. Supreme
Court ruling which upholds
the right of state institutions
to require students to live on
campus.

The initial ruling came
from the federal court in
in Monroe, Lousiana, on Sep-
tember 21, 1970 against a
suit filed by three students
from the Lotisiana Polytech
nic Institute.

This ruling was upheld on
April 5, with the court stat-
ing that ‘“‘there is Popeye
unconstitutational about state
colleges requiring all unmar-
ried undergraduates to live
in dormitories on campus."

Since Davidson is not a
state school, the ruling is

not particularly relevant, but
Bevan explained that such a
decision could easily apply
to a private institution in
the court,

Because of this legal stand,
Bevan . suggested that ‘‘the
fraternities in question not
invest vast sums of money in
a rash way to go off. cam-
pus,”’

He said that he was refer-
ring to the Phi Gamma Del-
ta group which is consider

ing a $50,000 investment for
another house; but since this
group has not officially re-
jected the. new social sys-
tem, it was not invited to at
tend the meeting.

Fraternity member Sam-
my Fisher said that he felt
the meeting strained the re-
lations of the court with the
college. “I got the idea that
we were being intimidated,
and that the whole thing was
just’a threat.”

Miscellany Expanding;

Meza Plans Improvement

By ROBERT TOUCHTON

Asst. Managing Editor

The Miscellany, Davidson's
literary magazine, is on the
threshold of becoming one of
the major literary journals
in America, according to its
editor, Mark ‘Meza.

In order to gain more mon-

y:-for its operations, the
journal has “improved rapid-
ly’ and has recently receiv-
ed numerous. grants from
sources in North Carolina.
Meza hopes to receive a por:
tion of the money which will
become available if the
budget for the college year
book is cut next year.

Meza says, however, that
the yearbook budget cuts will
not go to the Miscellany
automatically. ‘‘We hope,
however that we will
have made sufficient prog-
ress by next fall to be able
to put in a request for in-
creased funds showing the
progress we've made.’

The, Red Clay: Reader,
which has served as the
Charlotte area's major liter-
ary publication for several
years, is now defunct, and
Meza hopes his magazine
can take its place in sery-
ing the area.

The last issue is now sell-
ing in bookstores in this area
and in Durham ahd Chapel
Hill, A grant from .the Activ-
ities Fund will “allow the
magazine to send copies to
“‘sure-bet" subscribers from
London to HaWaii. Many of
these copies will be sent to
libraries.

With another grant,
petition in poetry,

a com-
fiction,

and hopefully, art, will be in-
stituted next year for North
Carolina writers in general.
The best entries will be pub-
lished in the ‘Miscellany, and
cash prizes totalling $300 will
be awarded,

According to Meza, ‘‘It’s
amazing how much, material
we've gotten. There have
never been as many contrib
utors in any area as there
have been this year. There
are, for instance, triple the
contributions of any past
year in fiction and poetry.”

Recent contributions have
come from places as distant
as the Netherlands and South
America, as well as from
writing colonies in this coun
try. Because of these new
contributions, the magazine
now has the ability to pub
lish twice as many good
works as in the past.

Additionally, the Miscellany
has finally become national-
ly recognized. Reviewers as
far away as Michigan and
California, have promised to
critique the magazine, and
three recent poetry volumes
mention the Miscellany along-
side The Sewanee Riview
and The New Yorker.
