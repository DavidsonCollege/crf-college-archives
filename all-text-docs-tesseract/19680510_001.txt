‘Cooperate, Graduate’ Joint Government Not Complete

When a speaker on the church and
society takes five minutes extra in
Thursday assembly, the result is usual-
ly an intense student hostility which
shows up in hissing at the least.

But Deacon Bill Currie had students
laughing so hard.at his going overtime
that the hostility never developed.

Currie, sports announcer for WSOC
in Charlotte, was the speaker for the
annual Who's Nothing tapping, into
which 12 students were inducted.

In the absence of the president of

the group, who was noted as the only
student ever inducted as a sophomore,
the group tapped two more sopho-
mores, in addition to the 10 juniors
and seniors.

“Cooperate and graduate” was Cur-
ie’s advice to students as he inces-
santly poked fun at the church.

“I wasn’t actually thrown out,” he
explained. “I just quit.” But, since the
ordination as a deacon is supposed to
be unchangeable, he said he was still
bothered by “the stain that lasts for-

After provoking a round of loud
hissing by mentioning the University
of North Carolina’s basketball team,
he described Los Angeles, to which
he had journeyed for the national
basketball finals.

Out there, you can “have anything
you want. I mean it. Out there the
Presbyterians drink liquor in front of
each other.”

Currie said he had entered a bar out
there—“an educational experience. I
believe in education, having flunked
out of Catawba. I know it’s wrong, but
I’m weak, and I had one myself.”

“} hate to mention this in these
cloistered halls,” he said later, “but
one of-my friends drinks.”

Although the trend toward
joint student-faculty govern
ment has been accelerating in
the last year, neither SGA
President Joe Murphy nor
Dean of Students Richard C.
Burts Jr. sees complete joint
government in the near fu-
ture.

“We are definitely moving
toward increased student
faculty government." said
Burts. The fact that students
and faculty are working to
gether on several important
committees shows we are
well on’ the: way. “‘and I
welcome this trend.” he said.

Burts did not feel that-Da-
vidson is headed for anything
like the Amherst College
Council, though. At that
school a joint student-faculty-
administration council holds
jurisdiction over all. social,
housing. and activity policy.
The council. half of whose
members are students, is sub-
ject. to review only by the
president and trustees.

Davidsonian Wins
3rd Hollins Award

For the third straight year THE DAVIDSON-

¢ IAN won honors

in the Annual Southeast-

ern College Newspaper Competitions sponsored

by Hollins College.

The award this year was an honorable men-

* tion in the field of the best non-daily newspaper.
Each participating college was judged by
submitting three consecutive issues of its school
papers. These are then reviewed and graded by
eight leading daily newspapers in the Southeast.
The purpose of the award is to recognize the
accomplishments of college newspapers and to
encourage careers in the field of journalism.
Other school newspapers in the state winning
recognition were “The Daily Tar Heel” of the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and
“Old Gold And Black” of Wake Forest University.

Foreign Students
Suggestions In Assembly

Richardson Scholars will
discuss suggestions. for im-
proving the foreign student
program in a voluntary as-
sembly in the Morrison Room
during chapel period on Mon-
day.

The discussion will attempt
to answer questions growing
out of a letter to the editor of
THE DAVIDSONIAN in this
issue signed by 11 Richardson
Scholars. The letter criticizes
the current program.

There already has been con-
siderable reaction to the
letter from Dr. John D. Kel-
ton, faculty adviser to the
foreign students, and from
students who have worked
with foreign students or plan
to do so next year.

Finn Skagestad, Richardson
Scholar from Norway who
did not sign the letter, agreed
with the purpose of the pro-
gram but disagreed with
much of what the letfer says.

“I particularly object to
the contention that the pro-
gram itself fails one of its
purposes and to the division
of Richardson Scholars into
two main groups. I would
consider Richardson Scho-
lars either as one group or
as 13," SKagestad said.

Tustead, he regards the

academic aspect for a foreign
student ‘as very flexible. It
gives the individual student
much leeway.”

Kelton indicated that the
reactions of the Richardson
Scholars this year were, fair-

On the question of military
withdrawal from Vietnam.
65.8 percent were in favor of
reduction, and an additional
12.8 of complete withdrawal.
Only 40 students (6.0 percent)
voted for increased action.

On the question of bombing,
41.8 percent supported sus-
pension, with cessation draw-
ing a strong second at 30.0

The overwhelming vote on

foreign students had felt in
the past. ‘‘They are torn be-

in the academic area and
what they want to do in areas

he said.

He said that each individ-
ual foreign student “must

between the academic and
non-academic. Agreeing with
Skagestad, he said that aca-
demic requirements for a
Richardson Scholar are ‘“‘flex-

Tom Hart, who worked
with the foreign students this
year, and Richard Howard.
who will work with them next
year, tended to agree with
the letter.

“I think there is a lot of
truth in what is said because
the attitude taken toward
foreign students is wrong.”
Hart said, indicating that the
academic is overstressed.

Howard agreed. saying, “y

think they have a valid argu-

need to be treated a bit dif-

son student." He suggested
that each foreign student
have a different professor as

A REVIEW
By DIRK GALBRAITH

The impression left by
opening night of “The Bov
Friend” was that everybody
in Hodson Hall was having a
good time, particularly those
who were on stage.

This take-off on the Twen-
ties is successful in captur-
ing the spirit of wacky non-
sense associated with that
period and at the same time
making the audience feel a
part of it all: those of us who
were there, and it was a good
house for a Wednesdav night,
were not laughing at the an-

Several faculty members
have seen such a centralized
council as a measure to re-
duce. red- tape and clarify
channels of authority. In ad-
dition. it would eliminate
overlapping student and fac.
ulty committees.

Five councils were recom-
mended by the Student Life
Subcommittee of the Blue
Sky Committee as replace
ments for faculty. commit-
tees last May. tach council
would consist of an equal

‘number of students and fae:

ulty.

‘“Aimong the five was a judi
cial council similar to the.
Regulations Court proposed
under the CRAP Report.

The subcommittee’s recom
mendation was released in
advance of the rest of the stu-
dent life report in order to
secure action on the propos:
als. but President D. Grier
Martin has never appointed
the joint committee requested
by the committee to svork out
details of the changes.

As for any action in this
direction now. though, “The
ink is hardly dry on the, new
student constitution."' Burts
said. ‘Let's live a while un
der the new struetures we've

just established. We need 19 |

work better with what we
have now.”

Murphy agreed that the
trend toward joint student
faculty government:.is. con
tinuing. but said it is not go
ing to get much stronger.

‘We already have voting
student members. on six
faculty committese.of, inter
est. to students. Effective
communication. though. is
more important than voting.
as decisions are. usually, un
animous.’"’ Murphy said. “As
long as the lines of communi
cation are open, there isn’t
really much need for a joint
College Council.”

Murphy would. however.
like to see the number of stu-
dents on the faculty commit-

r.@g a

— Fw

tees increased. Two of the six
integrated committees have
three student members: the
rest have only one éach.

“When you're the only stu
dent on a faculty committee,
it's hard to effectively present
the students’ point of view
without seeming overly force-
ful or critical.’ Murphy said.
“With two or three students
on a committee. communica.
tion would be greatly im

proved.”

Students are now holding
one position each on the Edu-
cational Policy Committee,
Library Committee, Athletic
Committee. and Religious
Policy Committee: two posi-
tions on the Religious Pro-
gram Committee: and three
positions on the Student. Life
Committee.

In addition. students are
now permitted to attend fac.

ulty meetings to present pro-
posals and defend them, and
are called on by the trustees
to explain proposals to them.

Murphy said he would wel-
come more faculty members
on student committees, “but
since most of our committees
are temporary and limited in
scope. it is a question of
whether faculty members
would be sufficiently inter-
ested.”

As scheduled, Richardson

Fund
Reaches
$2100

The Negro Scholarship
Fund has’ climbed to within
$300 of its goal. according to
Larry Slade. one of the chair-
men of the drive.

Slade said that students
have given $2100 in gifts and
pledges.

A letter has been sent out.
Slade said, to try to get those
who have pledged money, but
have not actually given it, to
get their pledges in.

By the time all pledges
come in, Slade hopes that the
goal of $2400 will be reached.

Contributions from the
faculty were mentioned as a
possibility for raising the rest
of the money should student
contributions fall short of the
full amount. This alternative
will be discussed with Dr. W.
G. Workman, initiator of the
challenge, soon, Slade said.

Slade also expressed hope
that the organizers of the
drive would be able to raise
outside funds in order to keep
the scholarship running for
10 years.

Slade said that he hoped
that the drive would not dry
up and die as so many other
Davidson drives have in the
past. The program should be
planned and carried out ef-
fectively, Slade said.
