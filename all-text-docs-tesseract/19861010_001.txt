Honor council receives extended jurisdiction

By NELLE MCCORKLE

Revised in August, the Code
of Disciplinary Procedure now
reads, “The Honor Council has
the power to hear cases and im-
pose sanctions involving student
organizations which violate the
Honor Code, the Code of Respon-
sibility or duly promulgated col-
lege regulations. The sanctions
against organizations may include

but are not limited to-those listed .

in II-A warning, censure, proba-
tion, fine, eviction, restitution,
suspension for a definite time, in-
definite suspension. Appeals from
any determination of a violation
by an organization or sanction
shall be the same as. those for an
individual.”

An elected body, the Student
Conduct Council includes stu-
dents, faculty, and administra-
tion, headed by the Dean of Stu-
dents Will Terry. Terry said of the
Conduct Council’s decision, “The
Honor Code hasn’t changed. The

Code ‘of Responsibility was
changed to reflect the new law.”
Terry called the right to try or-
ganizations the only substantial
change in the Code of Responsi-
bility for the 1986-87 school year.
“One thing we the Student
Conduct Council also set up,”
Terry said, “was a commit-
tee . . . to advise me in. . . de-
ciding penalties for a person who
violated the Alcohol Policy or the
Code of Responsibility.”
‘Appointed by the Student
Government Association Senate,
the three student members of this
Alcohol Violations Committee
are sophomore Joe B. Martin,
junior Bob Boyd, and senior Anne
Sanders. President John Kuyken-
dall will appoint a faculty repre-
sentative and one Dean of Stu-
dents Office staff member will
serve on this committee.

use of false identification, Terry
said, “The Honor Council hears
Code of Responsibility cases if I
decline to handle them or if the
student requests . . . Most stu-
dents say, ‘You just go ahead and
handle them.’ My _ horseback
opinion is that it (use of false iden-
tification) would probably be han-
dled as a Code of Responsibility
violation.

“A student could well be
charged with an Honor Code vio-
lation for use of a fake I.D. on
campus. He certainly will be
charged with a Code of Responsi-
bility violation, because you are
not dealing with other members of
the college community in an hon-
orable way. Not only are-you mis-
representing yourself, but you are
also financially jeopardizing the
person who lets you in down at the
fraternity house or in the 900
Room.

“The chief distinction be-

tween the Honor Code and the
Code of Responsibility is that you
are honor-bound to tum in -an
Honor Code violation, and you
are responsible to tum in a Code of
Responsibility violation,” Terry
said.

Asked whether the Honor
Council’s role changes in re-
sponse to its added responsibility,
or new North Carolina law, Honor
Council president senior Michael
Holt’ said, “practically, we
haven’t had any instances so far
that have really dealt with changes
in the new drinking law,- but I do
think it has an effect on the Honor
Code and the honor system.”

Holt said, “The Honor Coun-
cil’s role has not changed, but I
could envision problem areas.”
He cited use of false identification
and lying to campus security offi-
cers. “It’s the whole idea of hav-
ing to deceive people to get al-
cohol,” he said.

According to Holt, “The role -
of the Council has not changed,
but the new laws create potential
for more activity. The Honor
Council is not a policing force —
we're not there to enforce North
Carolina laws. We're not there to
enforce any laws beyond the
Honor Code and the Code. of Re-
sponsibility, and they haven't
changed. Maybe that new respon-
sibility to try student organiza-
tions can be considered a change,
but it hasn’t come up yet.”

“I think the role of the Council
is always the same — to seek out
the truth and to deliver a sanction
if a sanction is necessary, and that
role will never change no matter
what happens to North Carolina
state law,” Holt said.

Holt noted, “One of my con-
cerns is trying to make sure we
keep the Honor Code and Code.of
Responsibility separate from
North Carolina state law.”

Trustees approve study

investments allows the investing

board in £979, when the present _
