Tribe, Gozinyas Win Again; Faculty ‘A’ Cuts Self

, Back to live action in the
IMAC A League, as C.A. and
Y.B. continue to defy reason,
that, we don’t make any sense.

In an important game in
Division II, the fabled Gozinyas
defeated the on-the rebound
Delphic Bureau 66-51.

The Bureau ‘figured to be in
the game with the recent return
of Charles Bethea but the

deadly duo of Chris Young and

Indians Down Spes

In a grudge match the rowdy
Cleveland Indians faced off

. with their arch rivals, the

SPE’s. When the smoke had set-
tled, Juan (Chico) Sanchez
walked away with 30 points and
the Tribe had an 87-42 pummel.
It was your basic shoot out at
the Fantasy Factory as
Rodgeman, Sanchez and Dun-
can threw jumpers in from
Mooresville and beyond.

Also on Thursday, Old

the’ Division 4 crown of the A
League was nipped by uppity R-

21 points to offset Chris (Elder)

Elders Banished

Faculty A received their last
cut as Bowie sent them to
oblivion without end, out of the
league.- Rah-Rah Friars was
miffed at the judgment and is
reported to be in contact with
the unspeakable Umar to see
what can be done with Bowie.

But the whole school is-in con-
tact with Sattanish to see what
can be done about Rah-Rah.
You lose, Rah-Rah. You lose
Rah-Rah.

Women at Play

In a women’s game the cun-
ning runts of the Penthouse
Sweets nipped the cream-filled
Twinkies in a tight battle 22-8 as
the Sweets won the women’s
league outright at 3-0.

A big factor for the Twinks
was the coaching of John
‘Fringe Benefits’ Hornickel.

ball-led PAX team 74-68 as
Wags got 28. The Beach and Bill
McKinnon got 16 for. PAX as

Penthouse A Romps

Penthouse A threw out Etc. 60
to 33 as they continue to be one
of the finest frésh teams
around. Martin and MacBade
had 14 for the winners. So what?

The Delts II warmed up for
their match with the Tribe as
they crushed the SPE’s, 95-74,
behind 7 man double figure
scoring to offset Pee Wees 21 for
the SPE’s. This is the best Delt
team since this pair of deviants
has been here.

The Indians meanwhile jum-
ped freshman hall Gnads #1 by
a 92-29 score as Rodge had 29.
The Gnads just could not put the
ball in the hole.

This ‘ear a 3 = 6 week ticket to London is $512.; 2 - 3

York. (That's what the airlines say now. Last year there
were two unforcast increases!)

Miller Touted For Tourneys

Last week, I was looking for
subject matter for this column.
Watching television Sunday, I
found it staring me right in the
face- Johnny Miller.

Since he is making such a
shambles of the pro tour, I think
commissioner Deane Beman
ought to begin a _ handicap
system for the other pros. At
least the tournaments would be
close! Miller probably could
give out a couple of strokes a
nine and still win the tourney
with a few to spare.

Because Johnny admitted
last week that he was shooting
for a sub-60 round, I set the odds
anda 60 or less at 3-1 for the rest
of the season. I also see him as
even money of winning at least
one major tournament.

I have been receiving a
terrible amount of abuse for my
national basketball comments
lately. Well, Louisville con-
tinues to roll, beating Duke by 2

in overtime. UCLA loses to:

Stanford and many count them
out of the picture. Not likely!

N. C. State gets totally
destroyed by Maryland and
people ask me if I’m sticking to
my State prediction like I did
the Steeler one. The answer is
no, because after watching
them on TV, I feel David Thom-
pson is’ over-rated and
Maryland is much better.

Maryland looks like they have
a nice ticket to the finals as the
East regional winner will meet
the Midwest winner. The
Mideast is by far the strongest
region with Indiana, Kentucky,
Louisville, Notre Dame and
Alabama involved.

As a result of having heard
that many fans are in favor of
Indiana to go all the way (and I
disagree), I have decided to
begin a students Top 10 basket-
ball poll. Most people feel that
the coaches and writers that
pick the AP and UPI are off
their rockers, so here is your
chance to express your
opinions! Anybody is eligible to
list their choices and I will com-
pile them on a point system.
(They must be turned in with
the pollster’s name to Belk 162
on Sundays before 6 PM.) This
will be called the ‘‘Davidson In-
tellect Poll.’’ (Hereafter
referred to as DIP)

We move into local action,
where we find Rob ‘‘Gark”’ Can-
ning as the early 5-2 choice to
win the singles in IMAC ping-
pong. I stuck this in here,
because I suspect C.A. and Y.B.
would neglect it entirely.

Even though Duncan ex-
pressed dissatisfaction with my
entry into his literary field, I
wul continue this week with
more fearless IMAC basketball
predictions. The first crucial
game appears tonight as I pick
SAE over Derwood Derbies by
1. Contrary to what Y.B. says,
the Gozinyas, the strongest
team, should beat the Delt #2

fo close out this article I
would like to mention to those
that were actively involved in
my fall football ‘“‘card’’, that a
similar basketball issue will be
printed by the ‘‘Freek’”’ at
playoff time. For those of you
that de not know what I’m
talking about, well, I guess
you’re out in left field!
