NEWS FROM MASQUERS

The Red and Black Masquers
have announced that there will
be no second performance of the
play, “The Man Who Came To
Dinner.” The presentation of
this play took place on November
17, and a second showing on Sat-
urday, November 24 was orig-
inally planned

This second performance was
to be one of the events in the
Fathers’ Day Program, but the
illness of Shaw Smith, who play-
ed the leading role, necessitated
a postponement.

The regponse of the students
and town to the first presenta-
tion of the play was very en-
couraging and the Masquers, as
a result of a demand from many
students, planned a later show-
ing. The conflicts of other events
in the near future have made this
impossible, and it has been an.
nounced that such plans
been given up entirely.
