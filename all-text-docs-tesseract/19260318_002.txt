one match lost, and that by a close score |

the fight that they have exhibited this season.

Wildcat Baseball Team
Plays Quantico Marines
In First Game of Year

Wildcats Close Season With Great | £#™e in North Carolina will sound this aft-, Few Letter Men and Many New

Faces to Be Seen in Action

The beginning of baseball in North Caro-
lina colleges will be marked this afternoon
when the Wildcat nine meets the United States
Naval Marines from Quantico, Va. The first
game this year is almost ten days in advance
of the regular. schedule and the moulding of
the team has been somewhat hampered by
the inclement weather that has been preva-
lent this spring. Also, a number of the

regular squad are football men and were in
spring training for that sport when the first
call for the baseball candidates was sounded.

There will be a number of new faces in
the lineup this afterngon due to the large
number of letter men that graduated last
year. Practically a new infield will be pre-
sented, Abe Kugler and Kelly Woodham be-
ing the only letter men returning to cover
‘the sacks. Woodham has been shifted to the
joutfield. Dulin and Johnny Kugler have been
| covering third base and short, While Captain
Frank Alford has been brought in from the
outfield to hold down the initial bag, with
Age Kugler going to the kéystone sack.

The backstop for this afternoon is also in
doubt, the vacancy left by Sim Wrenn last
year still being fought for by many. Wick
Black, McGeachy, Laws, and Captain Alford
have all been used by Coach Monk in an
attempt to find a man to fill this position.

Flake Laird is still the standby in the
hurling department, with Oden, also a letter
man from last year, assisting him. Huie and
Maulden have also been showing up well in
practice, as have Hampton, Sappenfield and
Long.

Davidson College grapplers won by 12 to
9 against a strong team made up of Naval
Academy Plebes, or first year men, with re-
inforcements from the reserves of the var-
sity squad.

Among the varsity wrestlers was Wick-
horst, the big and powerful tackle of the
football team who has been named as captain
for next year. He outweighed Vance, who
opposed him in the unlimited, and kept the
advantage most of the time and won a de-
cision with a time advantage of three minutes
and twenty seconds.

No matter what the outcome of a game |
might be, we'd never be disappointed at all |
in the Davidson Wildcats. A heritage is
passed on year from year, which has been
coming down through the generations, and
which we hope will be perpetual.

Every time you meet a strange lad on the
campus, don't ever fail to speak. It might |
surprise you to know that this has brought !
several good men to Davidson—simply be-
cause of the spirit of friendliness on the
campus. We make them feel at home, some
|of them say, and that appeals to a man who
| maybe is leaving home for the first time for
any length of time.

| Two games will be won by the football
team next year, says Monk Younger, with
possibly a third victory. He feels as if we
will win from Elon and Guilford and says
we might nose out Wofford. That’s Monk
Younger, you know.

There is some cause for what he says,
when tackles and guards are so woefully |
lacking. We accept Coach Monk’s prediction |
with reservations, for the student body, we |
believe, has faith enough in Davidson coaches |
and will back the team sufficiently to assure |
Davidson more than two victories. |
