Asst. Sports Editor

The Davidson wrestling pro-

gram-has-finally gained.a new_ King -further indicated that — by.each grappler. Each wrestles.

coach. Professor of Math Luns-
ford King '59 was named last
week to fill the vacancy left
open when former coach Charlie
Parker fell ill.

King, by his own admission
prt in the field (his last
association with wrestling at ¢
was as a member of the Wildcat
squad during his undergraduate
days), brings to the program an
enthusiasm for the sport and a

willingness to work hard as his:

only credentials.

Delegating a great t deal of
authority to the experienced
wrestlers already on the squad,
King stated that his role as
coach would not entail the
installation of any new system.

FRESHMAN TERRY Greiner lunges in front of an opposing forward to break up a possible
scoring threat. The team faces powerful U. Va. at home this Saturday at 2:00.

Rather,/he will supervise the
seniors as they, to a great
extent, lead the team on the
mats.

was designed by team Captain
Pete Johnson; in fact, the two
weeks prior to his taking over
the coaching position, the team
held practices completely on
their own.

Booters drop two

By ROB GILLISON
Staff Writer
While parents and students

: . __ were having a leisurely weekend

(Gregg Strader)

At this stage of the season,
those practices consist of two
miles running a day and 12
minutes of actual wrestling time

two rounds from the up position
and, two from the down. This
makes for about one hour of on
the mat practice time each day.
King feels quite confident in
the wrestlers he has in the lower
weight classes, and is sure that
after football_ season and the
subsequent return of the heavi-
er wrestlers the team would be
surprisingly strong.

__One area that concerns King

is that, right now, there is only
one freshman wrestler and only
one is €xpected from the foot-
ball ranks. He is worried that
there will be a shorage of
experienced wrestlers in a cou-
ple of years, if interest in the
program cannot be generated.

here on campus, the Davidson
soccer team was having a not so
easy time in Atlanta.

The Wildcats traveled south
to play Georgia State and
Emory. They lost both games,
3-1 and 3-2 respectively.

The team, now 5-8-1, has lost
its chance for a .500 season
since only two games remain
(UVa. here on Saturday, UNC-
Chapel Hill, there the following
Saturday).

According to coach Karl
Kremser the team simply was
not ready to play on Saturday
against Georgia State.

“The guys played well for a

—rew Rites but then they

seemed to fall asleep. The
weren't mentally prepared.”

A team member explains ‘it
this way, “We had two five
hour drives, there and back.
When we weren't playing we
were studying. I'm beat.”

Sunday against Emory, the
team played well, but despite a
two goal performance by Pete
Sluiter, they were unable to
come up with the win.

“Emory has a lot of talented
individuals -- more than we do,”
said Kremser. “But the kids
played well as a team. We could
have won.”

The final two games promise
to be tough, but Kremser js
optimistic. “‘The guys always
get up for the tough ones, we'll
be ready.”

_Clubbers roll to win

By DAVE PIPER
Staff Writer
The Davidson Club Football
team has continued its winning
tradition with two victories iti
its last two outings.

"Two weeks age, the Cats
traveled down to Clemson and
pulled out a 15-14 victory with a
last second. touchdown. After
falling behind in the first quar-
ter, the defense tied the score at

~eight-all when, defensive tackle

Bobby Howard recovered a
fumble in the Clemson end zone.

The Tigers scored soon after
the half and the Cats were down

on their first possession, David-
son gained the lead with a
spectacular 90-yard pass and—
run combination from Rosen,
berg to Ken Pollock.

Aided by a successful conver-
sion of a fake punt and a
controversial pass interference
call, the Baptists tied the score
before the half. The Cat offense
moved the ball well but was -
plagued by three turnovers.

In the second half, however,
the Cats held on to the ball long
enough to put together a sus-
tained scoring drive that culmi-
nated in a halfback pass from

8 going into-the-final hull to Pollack for six points.

two minutes, quarterback Joby
Martin scored on a ten-yard
keeper as time was running out.
He sealed_the victory with a
pass to Rob Hull for the

two-point conversion.

Last week, the team played
at home against Atlanta Bap-
tist University. After the de-
fense forced the Bengals to punt

orkhorse Russ Folger had six
carries for fifty-one yards in
that scoring drive.

The team’s record is now 4-1
with two home games remai-
ning. Next week they play
Western Carolina, and then
finish the regular season a-
gainst Duke. A victory in either
game will put the team in the

post-Thanksgiving playoff.

...leftist coalition organizes

(Continued from page 1)

to actually organize for its
needs and goals. However, he
acknowledged that the breadth
of organizations represented at
Fraser’s conference was far
greater than previous efforts to
form a progressive Democratic
coalition, and therefore there
was more potential to get some
real committments for change.
. The coalition’s first target is
likely to be the Democratic
Party’s Mid-term Convention in
December where policy and
platform will be debated. Ac-
cording to Fraser, the new
alliance will demand that the
President and Democratic
members of Congress keep par-
ty platform committments,
support a move to abolish the
Congressional filibuster, and
set up a party reform task force
to create “‘a stronger, more
accountable, more ideological
party.”

Fraser admits the impetus for
the coalition was the success of
right-wing organizers at captu-
ring media attention and sha-
ping the public’s debate on

political issues. “Corporate re-
actionaries and their ideologies
for the first time in years have
taken the momentum from pro-
gressives in the arena of ideas,”
said Fraser.

“Power remains with Ameri-
ca’s elite and not with its
people,”’ Fraser charged. “‘Time
and again in recent months we
have seen that power exercised

against workers, the poor, \mi-
norities and women, young and
old, and even the middle class in
our country. America today
functions by a set of rules
virtually guaranteed to result in
a now too familiar outcome
—the haves take more, and
have nots get less. Those rules
must change and we must

aveloe a strategy to change

..nominees 1S picked

(Continued from page 1)

A history major, his interest
in small farmers stems from his
experiences growing up and
working on a farm and from
talking with British farmers
while on the St. Anne’s Pro-

gram.
“I want to look at the small
farmer—what he wants legisla-

tively, how he's organized poli-
tically, and how successful he is

politically.”
This is only the first stage of
the narrowing selection process.

The nominees must submit -

detailed descriptions of their

proposals and face even more
interviews, this time the dele-
gates of the program itself.

Barnard noted, ‘'I under-
stand my interviewer is a
Rhodes Scholar and a law
partner of Leon Jaworski. It
should be fun.”

Davidson was awarded two
fellowships last -year. John
Craig is presently splitting his
time among several Northern
European cities to study racial
problems there.Jeff Metzell is
researching the transportation
network of several nations, in
Southeast Asia.
