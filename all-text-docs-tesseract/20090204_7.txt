Chaos Reigns |

Duke Dormitory - Junior Aaron
Murphy composed a message to
his fellow members of the David-
son Grandfather Clock Enthusiast
Club shortly before going to bed
Monday.

“T just fired off a reminder about
the meeting on Tuesday afternoon.
Now I feel like I unintentionally
flipped the bird to God, Father Time
and my grandpa all at once.”

Murphy sent his email at 12:11
a.m. Though in his mind it was still
Monday night, the seamless transi-
tion to early Tuesday morning had
already occurred. When the rest of
the club accessed the message mid-
morning on Tuesday, they took “to-
morrow” to mean Wednesday.

“The results have been cata-
strophic,” Julie Tompkins ’10 said.
One of the few students to get the
email while awake, Tompkins un-
derstood the message from the au-
thor’s perspective and showed up
on time.

“We were supposed to complete
an application for a grandfather
clock in Commons! Now we’re
just going to get more of those
flatscreens like in the Union!” she
ranted. “No character or personal-
ity at all.”

Murphy has sworn to never re-
peat his error, but the GCE Club
is reportedly considering a vote of
“No Confidence.”

Area Man
“Too Friendly”

Davidson - Jeff Caldwell, 33,

was dining by himself at Toast

Thursday evening when he caught
himself _ be-
ing “too
friendly.”
Caldwell
had = just
finished or-
dering din-
ner when
his attrac-
tive, young
waitress
took his
menu and told
him to enjoy
his meal.

“Thanks, you too!” Caldwell
said. The waitress looked confused
for a moment before continuing
back to the kitchen.

“Then ‘I realized my mistake.
She wasn’t about to enjoy a meal.
What have I done with myself?”

Caldwell, who owns and main-
tains the website PuppyClipArt.
com, says he is too embarrassed to
ever return to the restaurant.

Caldwell: too nice?

Football Broadcast Interrupts
American Commercial Finals

Tampa - Super Bowl Extra-
Large 3 consisted of the usual
amount of tackles, catches, field
goals and gorilla-sized men pound-
ing their chests and slapping each
other’s rear ends. Yet according to
arecent AP poll, America no longer
tunes in for the shenanigans on the
field, but concentrates instead on
the equally time-consuming com-
mercials that fill in the gaps every
time somebody falls over. NBC,
in cooperation with this emerg-
ing trend, sponsored a nationwide
text-message vote for Commercial
MVP, as opposed to Game MVP.

“Who watches the
football anymore?”

“Who watches the football

New Psychology Study Reveals
Truth Behind Seat Choice

A ground-breaking new study
conducted by students and faculty
of the Psychology Department re-

veals the true reasoning behind seat.

choice in the classroom.

“This is ‘revolutionary. Our
findings are important within the
scientific community but have as-
tonishing real-world importance
and applications as well,” said de-
partment head Faroush Jadeed.

Researchers report that the rela-
tive distance from the professor is
the strongest link to performance
on written work, involvement in
discussion, and overall likelihood
to succeed in life.

“The further back you go,
the less likely it is the student did
the work. They are more prone to
daydreaming during class than the

This contrasts sharply with the
findings for discussion-style class-
rooms.

“In the discussion-circle class-
es, much work remains to be done.
It occurs most frequently in English
classes, which in my opinion, are
hardly worth the student’s time.”

Jadeed explained that much of
this is due to the more casual nature
of the English classes.

“Two out of every three students
are actually reflecting on the mate-
rial, drawing links with other texts
and analyzing their reading assign-
ments. The final third is inexplica-
bly and invariably pondering how
birds mix. #1 and #2 into the same
mixture. We call this the ‘number
