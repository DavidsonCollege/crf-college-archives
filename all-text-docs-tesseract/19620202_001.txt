_ Congressman Walter H. Judd, Republican represen-
tative from Minnesota’s fifth district, vill speak at David.
son on Feb. 26. A former medical missionary to China,

Judd is considered to be an

accomplished orator and one

of America’s leading spokesmen for the conservative

point of view.

Poll Seeks
integration
Opinions

On Monday and Tuesday, Feb.
56, the Student Council and
THE DAVIDSONIAN will con-
duct a poll on the student opin-
ion of integration.

The poll, taken in the lobby
of Chambers from first through
fourth periods each day, will
use the method currently em-
ployed in elections. Each stud-
ent will have his name checked
off when he votes.

The following statement will
be the sole content of the poll:
“‘t favor the admission of quali-
fled students of any race or
nationality to Davidson College
«+s (yes/no).”

Results of the poll will be an-
nounced in next week's paper,

“Two years ago,” stated
George Trask, president of the
Student Council, “a similar poll
was conducted, the results of
which were dubious due to the
vagueness of the wording of the
poll itself.”

“Recently,” he continued,
“the faculty resolved that no
qualified student should be de-
nied admission because of race,
or nationality. We feel that now
is the opportune moment to ex-
press student opinion.

“Thus our purpose will be
two-fold, first to indicate any
change in student opinion as
nearly as possible, but’ primar-
ily to express student opinion to
the Board of Trustees concern-
ing the admission of Negroes to
Davidson.”

Trask concluded, ‘We merely
want to indicate student opin-
ion. This is not an attempt to
petition or dictate to the
Trustees. We're not trying to
force the issue at all.”

Dean Rusk, thus providing the
opportunity of hearing both the
Kennedy administration and the
conservative points of view
within a short period of time.

Since Judd will be here for
only one day, the feculty hag
voted to hold a convocation. This
means that morning classes on
the 26th will be cut short in
order to allow a full hour chapel
Period for his address.

Following the address, a short

coffee hour will be held in the
| Goege Union. After lunch at
the SAE house, Judd will leave
from Charlotte for his next
speaking engagement.

A native of Nebraska, Judd
received his BA from the Uni-
versity of Nebraska in 1920.
While in college, he was active
in a number of religious move-
ments, and after earning his
MD degree, he served in China
as ‘a medical missionary until
1938, when increasing Commun-
ist pressure forced him to leave.

Upon his return, he was
awarded an LLD degree from
Miami University, and has serv-
ed from the 78th Congress to
the present. In 1960, Judd was

the keynote speaker for the Re

publican National Convention.

Five Crests Rock
At Midwinters Fefe

The Crests, a rock 'n roll re-
cording group, have been con-
tracted by the IFC to perform at
Midwinters
Olympics.

Bob Waugh, IFC President, ex-
plained that the Olympics broke
contract when their New York
agent decided that not enough
appearances could be booked in
this area to warrant their com-
ing here.

Waugh also said that the IFC
could have sued for breach of
contract but that the legal com-
plications and great expense in-
volved in a suit made the action
unfeasible.

The Crests, a group compar-
able in style to the Olympics,
were contracted through an
agent in Macon, Georgia, at no
extra cost to the IFC.

Skits Censured

Phi Delta Theta fraternity
took the largest measure of pun-
ishment handed out yesterday
by the Executive Committee as
a result of Wednesday night's
Greek Week skits.

The fraternity was “severely
warned” concerning any other
act of irresponsible conduct. All
1962 Greek Week activities were
cancelled. May 1, 1962, is the

pledges may be initiated. A
complete report of the action
will be filed with the national
office of the fraternity.

Also, the Executive Commit-

minimum scholastic requirements of nine semester hours and six quality points as set tee issued a “resolution of cen-

down by the administration.

Of these students, seven were
freshmen, eight were sopho-
mores, nine were juniors, and
four were seniors. Upon exam-
ination, this number appeared
to be. consistent with the figures
recorded for recent years.

However, no students are be-
ing required to withdraw at this
time, according to Dean Rich-
ard C. Burts. “The Executive
Committee does not want to
suspend men at mid-year,” seid
Burts in e DAVIDSONIAN in-
terview this week.

Though definite action is yet
to be taken on these cases by
the committee, it seems fairly
certain that no one will be re-
quired to withdraw because of
scholastic difficulty. The stud-
ents in question will probably be
put on academic probation this
semester, and will have to im-
prove and meet the standards
by the end of the school year.

Of about seven students who
did drop out, none were requir-
ed to do so because of grades.
In every case, personal difficul-
ties and lack of motivation led
the administration “to agree
with the students” that they
should drop out for a semester
or @ year, or, as in a few in-
stances, to encoursge the stud-
ent to remain out for a semes
ter or to transfer to another
school,

The underachievement issue
was raised, but, according to
Dean Burts, his office is taking
no action on this problem at the
present time. He made it plain,
however, that he has definite
sentiments toward this problem,

and toward men who fail, for
various reasons, to fulfill their
potential in scholastic work.
Burts underlined lack of mo
tivation as the principle cause
behind underachievement by
students. He said that this lack
can stem from a variety of
causes, such as unhappiness or
indecision in a choice for a life's
work, trouble at home, or a
growing loss of interest in
school in general. “It is not a
sudden thing,” said Burts.
When questioned on what is

being done for underachieving
students, Burts said that the
faculty advisers still form the
“first-line defense”  egainst
slumping scholastic work, end,
according to Burts, have and
show more interest in student
problems than the students
themselves realize.

The Dean agreed that a more
professional and personal ap
proach to student difficulties
might well be a big step toward
alleviating the underachieve-
ment problem at Davidson.

Dean’s List Returns

After 20-Year Limbo

In its December meeting the faculty voted to start
posting a dean’s list again at the end of each semester.
According to Dr. Frontis Johnston, dean of the faculty,
its purpose will be “‘to recognize the quality of work done

by the students.”

Students appearing on the
dean’s list will not be given any
special privileges other than be-
ing recognized for their work.
To appear on the dean‘s list, a
student must earn a 2.5 or bet-
er average.

“This will not be cumulative,”
said Dr. Johnston, “and it is en-
tirely possible for a student to
be on the list one semester and
off it the next.”

Dr. Johnston also indicated
that the dean's list will be post-
ed on the bulletin board and
that the list for last semester

will be posted in the next few
days.
In recent years, the registrar’s

office has been posting a list of

cumulative grades for the mem-
bers of each class, with the,
length of the sheet of paper de- ;
termining the number of names
of those eppearing on the lst. |

“It has probably been 20 years /
since Davidson has had a dean’s
list," said Dr. Johnston. The
old dean’s list was used before
the cut system was liberalized
in order to give the students on
it certain privileges.

NUMBER FOURTEEN

College Presents Plan
For New Social Center

+ Independents Elest

Steering Committee

BY MAC PLAXICO
Davidsonian Managing Editor
Approximately 70 independents met Wednesday in
the Union to hear a proposal by President D. G. Martin

and the Faculty Committee

on Fraternities, Clubs, and

Socia] Life that a new social group be formed on campus.

Prof. §. D. Maloney, chairman
of a special subcommittee which
has been studying the problems
of independents for the past se-
mester, presented the group’s
proposal.

The college wishes. if a suf-
ficient number of independents
are interested, to move forward
with some loosely knit, non-ex-
elusive “organization” whose
primary concern would be for
ithe Social life of its members.
The college is prepared lo pro-
vide physical facilities for such
a group at a nominal operating
cost,

After an hour long question
d discussion period, those in-
nts interested elected
a nine-man steering committee
to consider further the proposal
and to work with the faculty
committee on more definite
plans. Members of the steering
committee are ‘seniors, David
Jordan and Danny McRight;
juniors, Ben Cole and Rodger
Durham; sophomores, Neal
Bushoven and Al Mutlen; and
freshmen, Pat Fisher, Rufus
Hallmark, and Dick Vines.

President Martin told those
present that the college had
recently acquired a suitable
house for the proposed group—
the Lingle house, across from
Richardson Dormitory. Martin
said the college could not make
a final commitment until this
was approved by the Board of
-Trustees, but he indicated that
he thought they would have no
opposition to this use.

Martin and Maloney both in-
dicated a long-standing college
interest in such a project. In
addition to Chairman Mal~ney,
the special subcommittee is com-
posed of Dr. W. F. Goodykoontz
and Dr. C. J. Pietenpol. They
were both present at Wednes-
day’s meeting, as were also C.
Shaw Smith and Dr. George
Staples, members of the full
faculty committee. /

The subcommittee sees the
purpose of the suggested organ-
ization as “social, in the broad
sense of the term.” Membership
would be completely voluntary.
It was emphasized that this was
not being imposed on anyone,
that this was not a “fraternity”
nor could it ever become the
basis for an exclusive society
or a Greek letter fraternity. The
concepts of the proposed organ-
ization were stated in general
terms on a sheet which was
passed out at the meeting.

The basic principles, as sug
gested by the subcommittee, in-
clude: eligibility of alt Davidson

College students for member-
ship, equal rights end oblige-
tions for all members, encour-
agement toward respect for the
worth and concern for the wel-
fare of other members, encour-
agement of the development of’
the individual’s abilities, inter-
ests, ideas, and aims in his own
way, and the realization that
the member's primary respon-
sibility is te the whole commun-
ity of which this organization is
& part.

A moderate initiation fee and
semester dues would be requir-
ed for the upkeep of the social
center and its program. In re-
ply to a. question about cost,
Martin said that the college
