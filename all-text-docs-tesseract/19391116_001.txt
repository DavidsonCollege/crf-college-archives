Foreign

Policies

By Rene DeV. Williamson

ITALIAN FOREIGN POLICY

The foreign policy of Italy since
1922 has been one of the most per-
sonal in Europe and bears the un-
mistakable imprint of Benito Mus-
solini. In both internal and external
affairs, the Duce has kept a tight
hold over decisions by having all
important matters referred to him,
shifting even his highest aides from
one position to another, and having
held himself practically every Cabi-
net at one time’ or another.
No one in Fascist Italy has had the
independence of

Winston-Salem Acts |

——As-Hestess-To’Cats

Many and various were. the
celebrations in Winston-Salem
on Armistice Day, both before
and after the Davidson-Caro-

lina game which took place in!
The entertain-|

the afternoon.
ments were in the form of
bands,--parades, cheerleaders,
sponsors, and dances, with the
game stg@ding out as the main
attraction.

On Saturday morning at 10:00 the
sponsors
arriving

and their escorts began
for the parade. These
sponsors were selected from four-
teen Piedmont northwestern
North Carolina cities, each sponsor
having been appointed by the mayor
of the respective city. Every spon-
sor was accompanied by the mayor
of jher city in the parade.
Parade

At 10:30 the parade began and
was directed through two down-
town streets in Winston - Salem.
Several bands were in the forma-
tion: R. J. Reynolds high band ap-
peared first in its. brilliant black
gand gold uniforms; this was fol-
towed-by the Davidson-band march-
ing in its usual precise formations.
Then came the American Legion,
the National Guard, and the Band-

and

masters Band, followed last of all oy
the great musical organization from}
the University of North Carolina.
3etweén the bands and riding -in |
cars supplied by local dealers, were
the sponsors—the girls accompan- |
ied by their escorts, and the |
mayor of the particular city from |
which they had come. A large!
crowd was present all along the
parade route, and all seemed to be
with the highly colorful |
and musical affair.
Football Game
At 2 P. M. came the Davidson- |
Carolina football game. The spon- |
sors were present at the game in}
full regalia,
escorts had special seats of honor
directly on the edge of the playing
field. At half time, the sponsors of
each team were taken before the
stands of the opposite team and
introduced to the audience there.
After the game there was great
preparation for the dances’ which
were held during the evening. There
were five principal dances that the
college boys might attend. One was
on_the roof of the Robert E. Lee
Hotel, one at the Smoke House,
one at the Armory, and one at both
Salem College and Salem Academy.
