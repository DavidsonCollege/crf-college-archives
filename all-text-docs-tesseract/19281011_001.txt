No. 4

HOME-COMING DAY
PLANNED AS EVENT
OF MUCH INTEREST

Alumni Counci Will Arrange
Program—Many Alumni
Expected Back

D. C. MEETS U. N. C. NOV. 17

Feature Game of Year Expected
to Draw Great Numbers for
Home-Coming Day

The plans for Home-Coming Day, No-
vember 17, the date of the Carolina game,
are as yet incomplete. The Alumni Coun-
cil which is to meet October 19, will ar-
range the complete program. At this
meeting the speakers for the occasion will
be selected.

There will be a slight change in the

J speaking arrangement this year; at the
morning ceremonies there will probably
be only one speaker instead of several,
as was the case last year. The usual drill
of the R. O. T. C, unit will be a feature
of the morning program; immediately fol-
lowing this phase of the program: the
speaking will take place.

Last year, for the first time, a luncheon
was Served by the’ Alumni Association,
This plan was very successful and shall
be repeated this year. This meal is served
cafeteria style. This year the luncheon
will be served at 1:00 p. m. The price
will he the same as last year, fifty cents.
Serving this mealpis a great aid to the
alumni as it enables them to come direct
to Davidson instead of stopping en route
for dinner. There will be no speeches at
the luncheon.

According to reports,.the number of
alumni to return will be the largest yet.
If the Wildcats continue to play the same
type of football they have demonstrated
thus far, it is a certainty that all previous
numbers will be surpassed.

When the Wildcats meet the Carolina
team November 17, the paramount event
shall have been reached. This is the climax
of home-coming day, and many Davidson
supporters expect to hear the toll of the
college bell when this struggle has ended.

The High School Band from Lenoir
will play for this occasion. This band is
the joint guest of the Alumni and Ath-
letic Association. This organization
well known throughout the state, having

is
won the state contest last year held for

such organizations. They played
for the Virginia-Carolina game last year.

GAMMON DELIVERS
ABLE TALK AT “Y”

“A Man and Success,” Theme of
Charlotte Pastor’s Message

also

Rev. Edgar A. Gammon, well-known
and popular pastor of the Myers Park
Presbyterian Church in Charlotte, was
the speaker at the “Y” vespers Sunday
evening. Dr. Gammon chose for his
theme, “A Man and Success,” and in fol-
lowing. out this topic stressed the life of
Nehemiah as an example of réal success
in ancient Jewish times.

Nehemiah was a wealthy and an influen-
tial man—a man well established in life.
As the cup-bearer of Artaverxes, the
king ,he held a position of responsibility
and of unquestioned trust. This position
of honor and dignity, to which it had
been Nehemiah’s fortune to attain, held
also a deep responsibility to Nehemiah's
people, the Jews, then living in Persia.
Jerusalem at that time was a “national
junk heap” and with the gradual return
of the Jews to their original stronghold
came also the need of restoring the city to
its former state of magnificence and pow-
er in the ancient world and the urgent
need of repairing and rebuilding the walls.
Upon the shoulders of some willing lead-
er of the Jewish people this difficult task
must devolve. Nehemiah felt that God
had appointed him for this task and so he
assumed the great responsibility and, as
the Bible records show, accomplished the
tremendous piece of work quickly, and
with the highest degree of success, <A
leader, less able than Nehemiah, would
have shifted the burden, would have per-
haps offered financial assistance, but,
faced with the need of personal sacrifice
and endeavor, would have shrugged his
shoulders and let the matter rest. Those
others would not have given up cup-bear-
erships. Nehemiah did and Nehemiah was
a success.

Dr. Gammon pointed out that a man is
not judged by how well he does the com-
paratively easy and enjoyable tasks that

conduct each of these meetings which
will extend through Friday night.

In securing Dr. “Tolly” Thompson,
the Y. M. C. A. brings to Davidson one
of its most distinguished alumni, and
a preeminent churchman of the South.
As director of Religious Education at
Union Seminary, he is in a position to
influence vitally the religious thought
of this part of the country. As a man
of forceful personality he has made a
strong appeal to young men of col-
lege age, and has received a warm
Welcome on each of his visits to Da-
vidson.

Dr. Thompson was born in Char-
leston, S..C., where his father was a
pastor of one of the churches there.
Before coming to Davidson he lived
for a time in Washington, D. C., where
he began to prepare himself for en-
trance in the college here.

He came to the town of Davidson in
1900 and entered the Davidson High
School to complete his entrance re-
quirements for college work. In 1902
he entered the freshman class and be-
came a member of the class of ‘05.
Davidson College has seen few com-
binations of leadership and_ versatile
ability that “Tolly’ Thompson was
soon to show. In his sophomore’ year
he was elected secretary of the Eu-
manean Literary Society and was made
marshal by that organizations He
served on the Y. M. C. A. cabinet as
member of the social committee.

Taliferro Thompson then began to
come to the front with such rapidity
and in such varied fields that it was
almost startling. In his lasteyear his
responsibilities were almost a task-
master, covering the tremendous field
of activities they did. The Eumanean
Literary Society made him president
in his last: year, a position of great im-
portance in Davidson of 1905. In the
commencement exercises of the liter-

‘ar on the board

of editors of the Davidson Magazine
He was also a member of the library
committee, who had complete charge
of the school library.

His popularity with his fellow class-
mates is shown in the fact that he was
elected president of his senior class,
as distinct an honor then as it is now.
He was a member of the Kappa Sigma
social fraternity and took a
part in all of its activities.
