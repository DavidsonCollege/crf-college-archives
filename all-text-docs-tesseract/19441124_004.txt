The final Chapel service on
Thursday was -built around the
story of Jesus’ healing the blind
man. By this story we are taught
to have confidence in_ religion.

Christ; even in blindness, he relied
upon his faith in Christ when. ques-
tioned, and he worshipped Christ.
by obeying, following, and wor-
shipping Jesus Christ, we too can
come to the point where we can
say “ .-one thing I know, that,
whereas I was blind, now I see.”

A communion service on Thurs-
day night concluded the Fall serv-
ices. With ‘a large audience pres-
ent, Dr. Richardson brought

Realms of Thought”. Simply, they
can summed up in this way:
“God is love; He loves the world;
and He loves me.” The text
this was John 3:1-21, and Galations
2:20. ‘
