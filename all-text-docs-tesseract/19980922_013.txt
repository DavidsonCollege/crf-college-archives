petition in sports, a team can win when
all its guns are firing. There are days
when a squad can not miss, and oppo-
nents fall under the onslaught. Then
there are games which test the heart.

Men’s tennis wins at Wake

The post-Jon Pastel era has begun
for the men’s tennis team, and it ap-
pears brighter than originally expected.
This past weekend, Davidson won the
Wake Forest Fall Classic in impressive
fashion. They faced ACC power Wake
Forest, conference foe Appalachian St.,
and Elon.

The highlight of the weekend was
the mild upset over Wake Forest. Both
teams took three singles matches each.
Junior Alex Okulski (#2 singles) and
sophomores Whit Hanson (#3) and Billy
Boykin (#6) won for the Cats. Hanson
won 6-4, 7-6 (11-9), finally claiming
victory on his seventh match point. Re-
garding Hanson’s match, senior Paul
Wulfsberg said, “It wasn’t pretty, but
neither was Goldberg vs. Sting, a W is
still a W.”

Davidson’s #1 doubles team of
Scott Briggs and Judson Sutherland
easily defeated Wake’s top duo of
Guzman and Phillip by a score of 8-3.

Wake fought back as their #2 team
defeated Davidson’s Tyler Epp and Whit
Hanson 8-6. The heroics were then left
up to Brett Ialacci and Alex Okulski. In
a tight match, they defeated the team of
Ogden Phipps and Hayes Calvert 9-7.
Davidson won five matches to four.

The Cats had a much easier time
with their other opponents this week-
end, Elon and App St. Against App St.,
the Cats took eight out of nine matches.
Ialacci was especially impressive in de-
feating the Mountaineers top player,
Matt Lucas, 6-1, 6-3. Okulski, Hanson,
Briggs, freshman Chad Wineberger, and
all three doubles teams won. Against
Elon, Davidson swept all nine matches.
David Webb, making his Davidson de-
but, played a great match destroying
Elon’s Chris Kader 6-1, 6-0.

While they play a limited fall
schedule, Davidson was impressive in
their opening weekend. They demon-
strated that in the spring they will be
where they always were with Pastel, the
top of the conference.

The Wildcats picked up four more
points to three for the Bucks, and the
two teams were four points apart at'9-5
when the Bucks began to pull away.
The Bucks scored to extend their lead to
five points. At 10-5, Davidson Head
Coach Lisa Marston decided to call a
time out to try to right the ship.

At 10-5 in favor of the Bucks the
Wildcats, by all appearances, were in
trouble. The time out called by Coach
Marston was key. Witheveryone calmed
down the Wildcats regained the serve
after the Bucks scored once more.
Sophomore Brooke Bentley was serv-
ing, and the Wildcats made their first
impressive run of the game. After five
straight points, the Bucks won back the
serve at 11-10. A tip by Mara Mordini
brought the serve back to Davidson. On
a block by freshman Jennifer Ortega,
the score was tied at 11-11.

The Bucks got a side out, and
scored three straight quickly. They were
serving for the game, and the Wildcats

seemed to be ready to fall. Defense .

saved the game for Davidson. The serve
went back and forth between the two
teams with the Wildcats always on the
brink, trying to avoid what seemed to be
inevitable.

Inexplicably, after a side out, the
Bucks’ head coach called a time out.
Her team still seemed to be in control
and after the time out they got a side out.
The Wildcats won the serve back on a
block by senior captain Janet Duncan.
With junior Gina Lawrence serving, the
Wildcats scored three straight to tie the
game at 14-14. The game ended with a
flair, as the winning point was scored
on a strong double block by the Wild-
cats.

After the reversal in game 2, the
Bucks of East Tennessee had their backs
up against a wall. They managed to gain
a quick ‘3-0 lead at the beginning of
game 3, but with a service ace by Erica
Schwartz to tie the game, the Bucks
would falter. The game ended on a
spike by Gina Lawrence at 15-9.

It was a concerted, all around ef-
