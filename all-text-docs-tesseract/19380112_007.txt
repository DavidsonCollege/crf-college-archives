This beautiful brick structure stands on the Concord Road just off the Chartotte highway facing the
Martin Chemical Laboratory. It is built in the shape of a “T," and its interior houses every modern con-
veniénce desirable.

Upon entering downstairs, a visitor finds a waiting-room equipped with brown-upholstered chromium
jurniture in a distinctly modernistic note. To the left of tris waiting-room is Dr. J: W. MacConnell's
office. In the back hall Mrs. Irving Johnston, the Infirmary nurse, has her headquarters which are easily
accessible to the ward and two private rooms for patients which branch off of the hall. This down-stairs
ward will take care of about. six patients, and immediately behind it, in the very foot of the “T,” is the
solarium, which is equipped with comfortable rolling chairs and a cabinet radio. In the cast wing of the
firstefloor are Dr. MacConnell’s operating room, which is nicely furnished with every up-to-the-minute hos-
pital apparatus and the emergency room. Mrs. Johnston has her private apartment in the west wing down-
stairs. The kitchen with its shiny white modernistic equipment is also in this wing. The laboratory:and |
drug room are also on the iirst floor. vs

Upstairs are the private guest Tooms and a larger ward. Each of these private guest ‘rooms is fur-
ginished with a new suite of furniture, including bed, bureau, casy chair, bed-table, and lamps. There is also
a private bath for each room with shower as well as tub equipment. Vhere are four of these guest rooms, |
which in emergency will be used for student patients, and also a guest waiting room. The upstairs ward

will accommodate ten patients, and covers the entire west wing. There is a—large bath-room just off
