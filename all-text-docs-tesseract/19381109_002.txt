Homecoming

When we think of Homecoming the first
word that pops into our minds is “alumni.”
Homecoming might well be called Alumni
Day. All the rest of the days in the college
year helong to those who are actively con-
nected with the college, but this day be-
longs to the old grads,

With this in mind the program for the
week-end has been carefully planned. The
main event will be the nineteenth gridiron
clash between Davidson’s Wildcats and the
powerful V.M.I. Cadet team. For the past
few years Davidson has played her Home-
coming games against. far superior teams,
but this year’s embroglio should furnish
sixty minutes of thrills and excitement.

The annual alumni banquet will be held,
with opportunities for the alumni to renew
old acquaintances and make new ones. Then
theefraternity houses will be open to all aft-
er the game. :

But where do we, the students, fit into
It

the program? Why, we are the hosts.
We owe an obligation to the alumni, the
men who helped to mold and set on a pin-
nacle the great institution of which we are
a part.

As Dr, Lingle very appropriately express-
ed it in an editorial on Homecoming last
year: “In the

so0k of Exodus we are told

him, or ever to have heard of him, He feels
lost and had not come.
Everything and everybody have changed so,
A new generation has arisen.” Right there
is where we, students and faculty, come
in. We are the hosts.

To The Gripers

If you are accustomed to reading these
columns regularly, you might have been led
to believe that we Davidson students are
continually griping about something, whe-
ther it be a new rule of the administration
or the none too gentlemanly conduct of our
fellow students.

And, if you do believe that we are con-
tinually griping, you will surely wonder why
the Davidson gentleman is such a time-
hon@red tradition.

almost wishes he

*x* * * *

We don’t blame you a
bit, but it seems to be one of those peculiar
quirks that make life interesting.

A short time ago I overheard a member
of the senior Class who last year was one of
these chronic gripers tell a friend that he
had had to see the students from other
schools before he was able to appreciate
Davidson. He had spent six weeks in Fort
McClellan last summer in the R.O.T.C.
Camp where he “rubbed elbows” with the
students from the best colleges of the south.
Before that six weeks had passed, he was
thoroughly sick of the whole crew.

There is a good lesson in that for every
other griper who breathes his wrath upon
the pages of The Davidsonian, for there is
an intangible something upon the David-
son campus that makes it unlike any other
and much better. The origin of that some-
thing lies in great part on the institutions

which so many of us are prone to criticize.
So, before you gripe, count to ten and think

it over.—O.H.B.

some of the local boys, who had been at it

and decided to strike for higher pay. The
foreman handled the situation beautifully,
I think. He refused to argue, but told the
boys to go back to work or get out. IT: feel

higher wages, without ever stopping to rea-
lize that he wasn’t the man who paid the
Wages at all,and that even if he was he
couldn't have met their request without
completely destroying all discipline in the
shed.

Without stopping to point out what should
he the selfevident application of that inci-
dent -to our campus, T pass on to another
boy who wanted some changes made and
went about them in the right way. Whe-
ther you agree with his policies or not, all
you upperclassmen must admit that the stu-
dent who was the chief supporter of the
Freshman Vote and the Point System last
year really got something accomplished.
He created plenty of agitation; he saw fa-
culty members and students both; he wrote
constructive letters to the Editor of The
Davidsonian ; he submitted one of his plans,
had it rejected, worked over it, and submit-
ted it again, until finally he saw it pass
successfully. But all of this agitation was
carried on in an orderly, sensible way.

The purpose of my Compus Comment is
not merely to blackball demonstrations,
hissing in chapel, and the idle hull which
seeks to defame everything and everybody
except the speaker’s own pet (and, too
frequently, impractical) scheme. I believe
there are a lot of mighty potent, practical
suggestions in the minds of some of the stu-
dents which could he worked and
adopted if brought out in the light. The
trouble is that there also seems to be an
artificial smoke screen of misunderstand-
ing which is blotting many of them out.

In the spring of each year we elect those
officers whom we want to represent us in
various capacities. One boy who, in my
opinion, is working very hard and unsel-
fishly for the good of the campus as a whole
is its own Student Body President. Some
failed to give him credit for all he has been
trying to do because he failed to work any
miracles at the very first. But I have been
pleased to note the ever-increasing respect
which is developing for him in chapel. I
don’t say this as a pep talk for Fred, but be-
cause I honestly believe that by giving him
whole-hearted cooperation, by working to-
gether as a unit under our chosen leader,
we will do more for a better Davidson than
in any other way. It doesn’t apply to stu-
dent government alone. If you don’t like
the way the dances are run and have a bet-
ter suggestion to offer, don’t say “quack,
quack,” but see some member-of the Pan-
Hellenic Council. If you have any sugges-
tion for improving the work of the “Y”, see
some member of the Cabinet, The old maxim
“when in doubt, kick” has been applied a
little too far. Anything is preferable to
that—that is, if you really want to see the
campus improved, and don’t just want to
shine. SHERRARD RICE,

Pres. of the YMCA.

Advisor and President of ODK, to write

Support The Band

Dear Bill:

Let's take this time out to take
our hats off to the band. Those
fellows work hard—practice—drills
—playing the
dates at games—bad seats—all these
make up a life at the
football games. Yet we boo them,
criticize them, make fun of them;
and we never give them credit for
the good, hard job they are doing.

When the band make that series
of cleverly executed mistakes, ob-
viously and beautifully done, every-
body—always ready to kick—jump-
ed on the band. The band has put
on a fine show this fall, and each
credit for

between halves—no

player's

member deserves his
work.

It makes me mad to see a student
sit up in the stands, on a nice com-
fortable blanket, with his arm a-
round his date, and be a “Grand-
stand-Bandleader.” It is just bad
taste. Let’s support the band.

Yours,

DISGUSTED.
