prepared still allows that amend.

Council but also admits for peti-

YMCA MINUTES

This meeting was held at Erwin
Lodge as part of the program of the
cabinet retreat. Since the last meet-
ing Don Crosby has taken over the
post handling interracial activity.

The cabinet was led in an open-
ing prayer by Cannon after which
Strand presented the possibilities
of starting a Hi-Y program at
North Mecklenburg High School
and Gra-Y's at nearby schools.
Homer Sparks was mentioned as
being very much interested in this
program. The cabinet gave its ap-
proval for going ahead with the

Speed made a report of the pro-
gress being made on the program
for the study conference to be held
in March,

After discussion it was decided to
end two delegates to the regional
YMCA conference to be held this
weekend in Atlanta. Expenses will
be paid out of the conference
budget.

Mr. Gripe explained to the cabi-
net the filing sytem to be adopted

in the office. This will include a
report of every activity in every
Post and an individual record of
each student's participation in the
Y program.

Following a suggestion from the
Board of Directors, the cabinet ap-
proved of having a debate in chapel
on voluntary or involuntary mem-
bership. This will be under the di-
rection of Kalogridis, Cannon, and
Tucker.

Nickels asked the cabinet to con-
sider the need of a Johnson C.
Smith student from the Davidson
community who cannot continue
his education without financial
help. Speed suggested that the
need to be presented to the Bible
Class for their help, The cabinet
agreed to take enough from the
benevolences to bring the total to
$100.

After a long indecisive discussion
on the qualifications for cabinet
membership in which nothing defi-
nite was agreed upon the meeting
was adjourned.

Davidson's dilemna boils down to this: Nobody wants to

follow either alternative. We abhor the evils of professionaliza-
tion of our intercollegiate athletic program, and we cling to
the prestige of Southern Conference membership. Running from
either alternative, we meet ourselves once again in the middle

of the road.

Someone with strength must lead Davidson out of this
muddle—be he president, athletic director, or trustee. But it will
take someone with courage to follow the oniy solution we can

see—the seeking of a level on which we are competitive.

So

strong in some convictions, Davidson has appeared two-faced
and indecisive too long in this question of athletics. But action
is only in the hands of those who have the power to act.

who has a deep concern for the
welfare of humanity. I have had the
opportunity to live and work with
over 100 European students (some
of whom are now under Commu-
nism) in an international work
camp, and also I have been a stu-
dent at two other institutions be-
sides Davidson and have visited
numerous others, I have traveled
over Europe and have been in
every state east of the Mississippi
except two, and hence feel an un-
derstanding of some of today’s
world problems. The world is look-
ing for some positive leadership,
The world, I believe, is crying for
the type of leadership which Da-
vidson professes to produce, The
world wants mature, intelligent
men, with not only mental and
physical development, but with a
spiritual understanding and growth.
We profess to have it, but do we?

The world is sick, and many peo-
ple are looking to the United States
to heal it. Many more are looking
to the small colleges like Davidson
to furnish the leadership and help:
But it looks as though we, the Da-
vidson student body, are sick also.
The many Christians here believe
that Christ is the Way, the Truth,
and the Light, and yet they don't
ever display that belief on the
campus. If what we have to offer
the world is displayed in our daily
conduct (and that is what we are
judged on) then it seems to me that
we are offering the world some-
thing which contributes little good.
Can we not say that much of the
wounds of the world are not caused
entirely by our enemies, or the rav-
ages of war, but in part by us,
we here at Davidson, for we are in
many respects narrow, lazy, uncon-
cerned about the people around us,
uninterested in knowledge not given
in class, complacent, out for a
good time, with hardly a serious
thought in our minds, and, we are
also rude, undisciplined, disre-
spectful, and hypocritical. All this’
was displayed in chapel this week.

in almost every boarding house at
noon,’ the conversation centered
around chapel, and almost every-
one who expressed an opinion said
that chapel conduct that morning
had been terrible. This has also
been true to a great degree in the
past when similiar situations have
arisen. The mystery is: How can
chapel conduct be so bad when
outside of chapel almost everyone
appears to be disgusted with such
behavior? If all those, who outside
of chapel believe that such be-
havior is disgraceful, would, once
they get in chapel, refuse to take
part in such conduct, then the
problem would be to a great ex-
tent alleviated.

There are those of us in the Stu-
dent Body who have been greatly
concerned with chapel conduct ever
since we came to Davidson, We
had hoped that the new system
initiated this year which has im-
proved the chapel programs would
solve or at least alleviate the prob-
lem. For a time it seemed ag if
this were going to be true and that
Davidson's chapel conduct problem
was on the way out. But chapel
Tuesday almost extinguished these
hopes, It seems that there are
students here who delight in the
opportunity which chapel gives
them to lose their individual
identity and hide behind the
massed Student Body where they
can act like spoiled brats and let
the Student Body take the blame,
But the Student Body is made up
of individual sudents and students
who act as individuals would be
willing to take the blame for their
acts as individuals, It is true that
attendance at chapel is compulsory,
but attendance at Davidson is not;
and if a student does not feel that

‘he can participate in that part of

the college exercises without act-
ing completely uncivilized, then I

NEW MOVEMENT ...
(Continued From Page Two)
sor Wilson called for men who are
personally committed to life-service
as missionaries, and expressed the
opinion that the success of this
group would in large measure de-
pend upon such men as these for
whom missions is most necessary
and vital. Dave Moylan warned
against becoming “a study group”
on missions, and Bill Lord pled
for training in personal evangelism.
The purposes and interests of all
present were eloquently summed
up by Prof. McCutchan, himself a
missionary eight years, who spoke
of the need for the most excellent.
ly trained men in every technical
and professional skill who would
go abroad. He reminded the group
that in proclaiming the Gospel,
every talent and earnest Christian
endeavor is called for, The discus-
sion ended with the decision that
the SVM here would make inten-
sive study of the world mission
situation today, and would attempt
to combine with this some practical
application on the campus both in
bringing information about mis-
sions to the student body and in
trying here and now to be witnesses
to individual men of the Gospel

and its potency in a man’s life.

It is the hope of many that the
SVM will be a channel for the ef-
fectual expression of the enthusi-
asm which was evidenced among
those present. The group was or-
ganized with the conviction that
good intentions are not enough, but
that individual aspirations, . stale-
mated as they are by individual
limiations, mut be joined together
to the end of inspired concerted
action, The opening hymn might
well express the concluding
thoughts:

“Heralds of Christ, who bear
the King’s commands,

om.

do not believe that either Davidson |:

or that student will profit by his
remaining in college here.

I do not know what measures, if
any, should or could be taken, but
if we as individual students refuse
to act as gentlemen, then I believe
the time has come for drastic action
of some sort to be taken cither by
the Student Council or the faculty.
The whole problem of chapel con-
duct, however, would vanish over-
night if we as individuals would
put into practice the common,
everyday courtesy and decency
which any self-respecting person
should possess.

Sincerely,

LEWIS BAKER.

ways would better accommodate
the traffic to and from the board-

ing houses,

Secondly, the construction of
parking spaces would prevent
reckless drivers from driving
hap-hazardly through the mid-
dle of the court. This would
make for a safer walkway for
the student heading for the
Concord Road boarding houses,
At the present he is never sure
when the jokesters will use
their brakes before hitting hit.
Thirdly, the present condition of

the court structure provides no ef-
ficient method for drainage.

Finally, if some of the trees
in the court were cut down,
more sunlight would be shed
on struggling fraternity lawns.
This would have to be done
anyway if parking spaces and
landscaping were added to the
circle,

tain members of the court that grass

FIRST GREEK WEEK...
(Continued From Page Two)
plan no one really got to know
anyone else, Next year, if there
is to be a Greek Week, why not
let all the visiting pledges meet
the host pledges a half an hour be-
fore supper at the house of the
host pledge group? In this way,
eating dinner with another frater-
nity would mean something more

than just eating out.

The skit idea also was good and
will be bettered by this year's
shortcomings. However, more time
should be allowed each skit and
a stfict adherence to that maximum
time limit should then be main.
tained. With adequate planning
these skits cowld become the high-
light of the pledge training.

With adequate planning too, the
whole week can be improved by
tremendous proportions. The week
should not immediately precede a
dance weekend, for one will in-
evitably appear anti-climactic. If
professors will cooperate in the pro-
posed well-organized week, then
the pledges will not be encounter-
ing tests and long assignments dur-
ing this one week,

One proposed feature of this
year’s plan was that of a
pledge.brother day comparable
to the freshman-sophomcre
day.

This, the pledgemasters unani-
mousiy agreed, was not good and
should be left to the jurisdiction
of the individual fraternities.
Through working and playing to-
gether within each fraternity comes
pledge spirit and solidarity, If the
ultimate purpose of Greek Week
is to do away with the individual
fraternity’s project or Hell Week,
then let us go on record as

prophesying its failure; but if the] #

plan behind Greek Week is to help
the pledges to meet each other and
to accomplish some positive good,
then let us assert our wholeheurted
support. It is with this aim in mind
that we submit the foregoing pro-
posals.

In closing, let us say again that
these proposals are not set forth
as hard and fast rules, but merely
as recommendations after discuss-
ing this year’s program. Each year
invariably will bring different prob-
lems requiring separate solutions.
However, as a step toward accom-
plishing some concrete action we

would like to suggest two distinct
things for the serious consideration
of the eleven fraternities: first, that
as soon as next year's pledgemas.
ters are selected that they organize
and elect a chairman, or co-chair-
men; and secondly, that they be
authorized by the fraternities to
plan and coordinate next year's
Greek Week. Give them the re-
sponsibility then to Settle all the
nebulous details in accord with
their best judgements and the exist.
ing situation, and as the result, we
feel, will be a better Greek Week
for all concerned. ‘
Sincerely,

BOB HENRY.
