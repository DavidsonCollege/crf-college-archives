Baseball

Records Were Meant
to be Broken

By GIGGY MAXWELL

As the 1990 Davidson Wildcat
baseball season winds down, several
career and season records stand to be
broken.

The leader, far and away, ofcourse,
is senior pitcher Greg Wilcox. Enter-
ing the 1990 campaign, Wilcox al-
ready owned the season record for
wins (11) and thecareer strikeout mark,
(254). As his senior season has played
itself out (he is currently 8-1, with a
2.50 ERA), Greg has continued to add
to his list of achievements. He is cur-
rently the. winningest pitcher in
Davidson history, in both wins (29 and
counting) and winning percentage
(.674), and has alsostartedmore games —
(42) and thrown more innings (351.3)
than anyone ever to don a Davidson
uniform. It’s probably safe to say that
theserecords willremain unchallenged
at least until the turn of the century.

Senior center fielder and resident
speedster, Ron Kmacik, also has his
sights set on some notable Davidson
records, specifically the season and

career stolen base records. His current
totals are 17 and 52, respectively. He
needs 11 thefts to surpass the season
mark and 13 to eclipse the career rec-
ord. Both marks are currently owned
by former Olympian and current mi-
nor-leaguer Bill Masse.

The other senior vying for a place
in Davidson athletic history is second
baseman Mikio Aoki. Mikio has 14
doubles this season. With a strong
finish, he could surpass the mark of 19
set two years ago by Roy Vilardi.

Newcomer and preseason 3rd team
All-American Rob Eenhoom also has
his sights set on some lofty goals. By
season’s end, he should own the sea-
son record for hits (he is currently 16
hits shy with 14 games to play) and be
close to the season record for total
bases.

If the ‘Cats can go 10-4 the rest of
the way, the team will be the win-
ningest in Davidson history The pres-
ent highwater mark stands at 28 wins.
So, with only fourteen games left in
the 1990 season, get out to Wildcat
Park and get yourself a taste of
Davidson athletic history.

Lee, of our own Davidson College
Union, placed second, and Billy De-
vens took third. Women’s tennis coach
Caroline Price, who staged the affair,
stated that the goal of the tournament
was to determine the interest and level

of play of racquetball players on cam-
pus. She plans to parlay that interest
into three tournaments at Davidson
next year and aclub team (to compete
intercollegiately) in the near future. If
you are interested, cdach Price is the
person to whom you ought to talk.

So men of Davidson, I propose
something alittle platitudinous. Butit
could be alot of fun. Let’s respect our
women as we would our sisters.

If we tried this, I think we would
become aware of everything wonder-
ful that separates us from them, (in a
fuller sense), and we would suddenly

Republic

find dumped in our laps along with
this friendships that would be
enormously edifying. And then when
love eventually came along it would
be magnificent, and developed fully
for that person. You see if we began
to do this, there would be absolutely
noreason why alittle girl would only
trust a man if he were behind iron
bars.
