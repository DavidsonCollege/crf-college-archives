Eating Clubs

Letters appearing elsewhere on
these editorial pages attest to at least
one significant fact: despite the hopes
of many, the present fraternity squab-
ble is not going to die either quickly
or easily.

Bob Young offered two major pro-
posals in his talk-—-sophomore rush
and 100 per cent bidding; rejecting
these, IFC President Rick von Un-
werth suggested that “the administra-
tion, together with the IFC, could pro-
mote the organization of one or two
local fraternities in the form of eating
clubs in addition to Lingle Manor.”

Von Unwerth’s chief proposal is the
formation of ‘one or two” local fra-
ternities which “could be organized
along the line of fraternities, with,
board privileges and a social budget
requiring dues from each member.
The clubs would, like Lingle Manor,
be open to all students or be based
on majority approval. Unlike Lingle
Manor, the clubs could offer good
meals in a dining room and an organ-
ized program. Lingle Manor could be
retained and supported by students
who couldn’t afford dues.”

Such a proposal, on the surface, has
great appeal. And if it could work
we would be delighted. But we doubt
that such an addition—with the pres-
ent system otherwise unchanged —
would work. We look back to the
spring of 1962 when the plans for Lin-
gle Manor were announced: the inter-
est which developed among indepen-
dents was not widespread, even when
the program envisioned was far great-
er than that which has actually devel-
oped.

Certainly before any steps are tak-
en towards forming eating clubs. a
poll should be taken to determine In-
dependent interest in such groups.

100 Per Cent Bidding

We simply cannot buy the idea ot
100 per cent bidding. Certainly we
see no benefit for the fraternity or its
members in being compelled to take
someone whom they would not volun-.
tarily invite to join. But far more im-
portant we envision only a sad experi-
ence for the person who elects to ac-
cept an invitation which was not ex-
tended with sincerity, The experience
of walking into a house only to be
shunned rather than welcomed could
be far more traumatic than any situa-
tion encountered under the present
rush system.

The bases for friendships are often
irrational and seldom clearcut. The
bases are certainly more extensive
than mutual intellectual and cultural
interests, as some would have us
think. There must be something in
common, but all too often that “some-
thing” is quite elusive. The idea of
arbitrarily placing individuals togeth-
er on the basis of “mutual interests”
is doomed to failure from the start.
Friendship can only be formed by
principals, not by a third party.

The primary function of a frater-
*nity is to serve as a social outlet.
And, while we think the fraternity
should be interested in the develop-
ment of the “whole man,” we are nev-
ertheless cognizant that the social
facet of the individual receives the
most attention from the fraternity.
And since it is the social relationship
that receives the most consideration
within the fraternity, we question the
wisdom of a third party ever assum-
ing arbitary authority—by forcing 100
per cent bidding or using any other
compulsory tactic—over the composi-
tion of a fraternity’s membership.

_. Membership in a fraternity at Da-
vidson is based upon mutual agree-
ment, The fraternity may or may not
extend an invitation to a student; the
student may either accept or reject
an invitation. We support such a sys-
tem of mutual assent: neither the fra-
ternity nor the student is compelled
either to accept or to reject the other.

Our concern does not focus on
changing this essential factor in the
System as we know it at Davidson. We
do not want to see this feature of vol-

we seek the mechanics whereby the
system can operate in a more fair and
equitable manner.

Deferred Rush

Last week we endorsed the idea of
deferred rush:

—Freshmen as a class unit would
have to become adjusted to David-
son College as a whole before going
through Rush.

—And since all freshmen would
have had an opportunity to adjust to
the college as a whole before encount-
ering Rush Week, those who suffer
the shock of rejection by the system
would have something to fall back
upon: they would have had an oppor-
tunity to discover that Davidson Col-
lege is bigger than Patterson Frater-
nity Court.

—Both the freshman and the fra-
ternity would get to know each other
better. Superficialities would die from
overexposure; brass tacks would be-
come more pointed.

—The strong would not get
Stronger; the weak would not get
weaker. Rather the freshman would
learn that the “strong” are not as
strong—and the “weak” not as weak
—as he first thought. He would judge
groups not on the basis of their ne
ulous campus reputation but on the
basis of the individuals comprising
the group.

—Freshman social life would not
shudder to a halt. Instead rush would
be adjusted to accommodate fresh-
man social life.

Pledgetraining

We have examined the three main

proposals to grow out of the current
hassle. To these we would like ‘to add
a fourth. a suggestion made by THE
DAVIDSONIAN in the September 19
issue of this year. In an editorial en-
titled “To The Pledgetrainers .. .” we
urged that the pledge programs on
Patterson Court be reexamined. We
did not attempt to detract from the
generally commendable work of the
pledge programs in the areas of schol-
arship and fraternity spirit; rather we
asked the pledgetrainers to take note
of what they were not doing.
_ We offered suggestions for mak-
ing pledge programs more vital: we
urge pledgetrainers to examine again
these suggestions.

Going one step further:

The IFC has attempted this year
to become more than a glorified book-
ing agency. President von Unwerth

and his cohorts have attempted to

convert the IFC into a true interfra-
ternity council, concerned not only
with entertainment on weekends but
also with all facets of fraternity life.
We laud this move. And we propose
that the IFC view Pledgetraining asa
matter for interfraternity concern.
Certainly each fraternity has certain
matters that would be peculiar to its
pledge program. But the IFC could
perform a valuable service if it set
up general guidelines to be followed
by all fraternities in their pledge pro-
grams.

Looking Further

One fact becomes clearer and
clearer as the issue becomes cloudier
and cloudier. No system will be with-
out problems. However, it is also
quite likely that the system presently
in operation at Davidson leaves much
to be desired,

_ The fraternity question is not go-
ing to be resolved overnight. And
rightly so. The complexities are nu-
merous and difficult. Extended and
thorough investigation is necessary.
We recommend — we urge President
Martin to appoint a committee rep-
resenting all factions to study the
problems and to attempt to offer con-
structive and feasible proposals by a
specific date.

WRAY BLASTS GREEKS

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Greeks Hit In Running Battle

ane,

by Lingle

Dear Editor:

Today I received and read my
copy of. the Nov. 13 edition of
THE DAVIDSONIAN with great
interest and concern. This time
1 sincerely hope that the re-
hashing of the problems of Da-
vidson's fraternity system will
result in definite action on the
part of the Administration and
the IFC that will correct some
of these problems.

I was one of those ‘fraternity
rejects” at Davidson. With this
as the major reason. I decided
to leave Davidson at the com-
pletion of my sophomore year.
Perhaps because of my own
weakness—perhaps not—I decid-
ed that I could not remain at
Davidson as an Independent.

Naturally. I, as one that re-
ceived no redates or bids during
Rush my freshman year, felt a
certain amount of bitterness to-
ward Davidson's fraternities.
However, as a transfer to a
state university, I have now be-
come a fraternity man, pledg-
ing—what would be called in
Davidson terminology — one of
the ‘‘strong’’ fraternities on
campus.

Because of this, I feel now
able to examine Davidson's fra-
ternity system in comparison
with the system at my school.

I think the first. thing David-
son fraternity men should real-
ize is the need for change. Of
the almost 40 boys in the orig-
inal Class of °66 who have left
Davidson since the beginning of
the freshman year, over 75 per
cent were Independents. The
lack of fraternity affiliation is
undeniably a reason for many
departures.

I believe that the chief need
is a delay in the Rush program
until the second semester or
the sophomore year. Here at
USC, rushing in my junior year
I did not feel in the least out of
place. In my pledge class of
some 22 boys, only four are
freshmen. The majority are

Fraternity Row Kept Under Heavy Fire

Dear Editor:

One of the little ironies of the
discussion which has been rag-
‘ing over proposals to modify
the fraternity system at David-
son is that the proposals are not
directed towards solving any
“fraternity problem" at. all.
There is nothing wrong with the
fraternities. They are operating
now as they always have. Nor is
the problem one under discus-
sion one which concerns the in-
dependents alone, as the propos-
als made in the last two weeks
seem to indicate.

We are dealing with a prob-
lem which must be faced by
every student who enters David-
son and which, therefore, ougit
to concern the entire student
body: ‘How shall I satisfy my
social needs, my need to form
lasting friendships, to meet girls
and to seek advice while I am
a Davidson?”

I am now entering my fourth
year as an independent. I have
no qualms, no regrets. I have
turned down offers by fraterni-
ties before and would do so
again. As I look at the frater-
nity system from the outside. I
see nothing but- bickering and
snobbery.

“BICKERING & SNOBBERY”’
Large fraternities look down
on small fraternities; prestige
fraternities look down on what
they think to be socially inferi-
or groups: the ‘“‘jock” fraterni-
ties look down on the ‘‘fly’’ fra-
ternities; ‘‘cool'’ fraternities
look down on the “uncool”; the
southern fraternities look down
on the not-so-southern fraterni-
ties: the not-so-southern frater
nities look down on the southern
fraternities: the fraternities that
emphasize leadership look down
on those that don’t; all. frater-
nities look down on the inde-
pendents: and the independent
independents look down on the
independents in Lingle Manor.

Some of this begins to wear
off by the senior year. Some
members of my class have ac-
tually spoken to me on campus
who never spoke before. But
for myself and for a growing
number of my fellow-students
(some of them—I even suspect
—are fraternity members) the
answer, ‘‘Go join a fraternity,”
is no answer at all.

NO MORE FRATERNITIES

NEEDED

A variant of this answer is,
“Go form a fraternity (eating
club or social club).” But this
was lest year’s answer to the
problem, and the college
promptly provided Lingle Man-
or. This year’s answer to the
problem is to form two (more)
fraternities, or eating clubs or
social clubs. If these fraterni-
ties are formed and the present
trend continues next year we

will be advised to form four
{more) fraternities, or eating
clubs or social clubs. Yet the
combined membership of the
Greek-letter fraternities plus the
membership of Lingle Manor
is actually Jess than the combin-
ed membership of the Greek-
letter fraternities alone when I
entered as a freshman. and, in
addition, we now have a larger
student body than we had in
1861.

It is eviGent that forming
more fraternities is not the an-
swer. It does not matter wheth-
er there are 12 fraternities, or
13. or It, or 19, or 25, or 104,
because they will still not be
able to accommodate al! the
entering freshmen. It is not that

the existing fraternities do not.

have room for an increasing
percentage of each freshmen
class each year. It is that an
increasing percentage of the
freshman class each year does
not have room for fraternities.

Is this an entirely new phe-
nomenon? Is this discussion on-
ly necessary because of some
slip-up in the Admissions Office
last year or the year before? I
have not talked to a single sen-
jor independent who would join
a fraternity if he ‘thad to do it
again’. I have not talked to a
single senior independent who
would permit his son to go to
Davidson as long as fraternities
hold the monopoly on social ac-
tivities.

TREMENDOUS ANTIPATHY

I do not believe that I can
possibly overstate the antipathy
which exists between the fra-
ternity, or eating club, or so-
cial club and the independent.
ese organizations require(‘KD,
These _ organizations require
money, which the independents
by and large do not have: they
require cars, which the inde-
pendents by and large do not
have; and they require time.
which the independents by and
large are not willing to give.
And this to say nothing of the
occasional entering freshman
who has outgrown in high school
his mania for joining secret or-
ganizations and learning secret
handclasps.

What do the fraternities offer
to the student at Davidson Col-
lege? Is there anything positive
that they can contribute to the
life of the student? The merits
of the fraternity system hinge
on two things: the mystical con-
cept of ‘‘brotherhood"’ and the
fraternity monopoly on organ-
ized social activities.

ABOUT BROTHERHOOD

This is how the fraternity
system looks from the outside:
When you talk of “brotherhood”
to an independent, he thinks of
the hurt and bewilderment

at the Union after Greek Week
each year. He thinks of the boy
sitting by himself who can’t
bring himself to associate with
those who have been rejected
and yet is slowly coming to re-
alize that he has been rejected
himself.

I know that there are good
things about ‘‘brotherhood”’. A
friend of mine once told me taht
if I could only sit in one “ball-
ing” session and see what the
fraternities have done, and have
tried to do for their pledges.
then my whole outlook on fra-
ternity exclusivism would be
changed. But exclusivism re-
mains the basis of ‘‘brother-
hood”. Each fraternity ends by
excluding 95 per cent of the stu-
dent body and having ‘'brother-
hood” with what's left.

But what is this brotherhood?
Ideally, it is much more than
friendship: you can be friends
with someone outside of your
fraternity, but he can never be
your ‘‘brother’. Yet one does
not have to carry the inquiry
too far to find out that some
‘brothers’? are not even friends.

I began this letter by saying
that the entering freshman
needs three things: friendship,
girls, and advice. The frater-
nity system claims to provide
all three: friendship and advice
are supplied through ‘‘brother-
hood”. Friendship is. based on
mutual choice. “Brotherhood”
seems to be based on a sort of
“mutual exclusion’. Even if the
fraternity system as it now ex-
{sts promotes the formation of
some lasting friendships. the
concept of “‘brotherhood” must
be equally an aid and a hin-
drance. And the ‘advice’ which
the pledge trainee receives
from his brothers is surely a
mixed blessing.

A NEW SOCIAL LIFE

It is often argued that, as ex-
clusivism is a dominant social
trend in the outside world, it
should exist at Davidson also.
But before we can evaluate this
argument, we must understand
that the mutual exclusion which
exists at Davidson is much more
intense than that practiced in
the outside world. When I join
a country club in Charlotte, I
Tealize that this is not the only
way in which I can have rela-
tionships with my _ fellow-men.
Many, in fact the vast majority
of mankind, will live quite as
happy and useful lives as I
without ever seeing the inside
of my club.

At Davidson it is almost a so-
cial necessity to join some-
thing. But why should we lower
our standards to conform to the
outside world at Davidson? How
is the world ever to survive for

which he sees on the new faces the better life if we can't even

wait to get into it before we
start conforming?

If this monopoly were remov-
ed. if the college were to pro-
vide for the social life of ALL
the students through an organi-
zation in which ALL of the stu-
dents might participate, the pri-
mary reason for the existence
of the fraternity system would
be gone, the fraternities would
close down in a few short years
for lack of members, and the
houses might be put to better
use.

MIXERS EVERY WEEK

This is precisely what I pro-
pose. The budget of the College
Union should be multiplied.
““Mixers"', such as the one held
for the freshmen with Converse,
should be organized every week-
end either by having the girls
come on campus or by chater-
ing buses to take the students
to the girls’ schools. These ac-
tivities would be open to all stu-
dents who are not able. or do
not wish, to make other arrange-
ments. Gradually, the Union
would take over all the duties
of planning formal dance and

_ concert weekends.

As the Greek-letter fraterni-
ties and Lingle Manor one by
one fall below a certain min-
imum mebership requirement,
I suggest that their houses be
taken over by the college to pro-
vide additional dining space for
the student body. The question
of who would eat in the ex-fra-
ternity houses would be decided
by some arbitrary means. such
as drawing numbers out of a
chat. Later. when the majority
of the fraternities had been
abolished, the question of who
would eat where could still be
decided by lot. or the houses
could be converted into special-
interest houses which would be
centers for organized and unor-
ganized discussions relating to
problems in the various fields,
such a history, English, math-
ematics, political science, etc.
The students might then sign
up to eat in a particular house
for as long or as short a period
as they might wish. despending
on the space available.

T hope that I have at least
presented the problem of social
life on this campus in a new
light and from a new perspec-
tive. I do not expect the solu-
tion to this préblem to take
place overnight, and I am sure
that I will not benefit from
whatever is done. But in about
twenty years, when my son is
looking at colleges, Tl! glance
once more at a Davidson cata-
logue. and maybe I'll be pleas-
antly surprised, who knows?

sophomores, but there are sev-
eral other, juniors besides me,
along with one senior.

The fact is this: every enter-
ing freshman at Davidson is not
ready to go through Davidson's
rigorous, selective Rush pro-
gram. I know, because I was
one of those unprepared ones.
My sophomore year I believe I
could have survived and may-
be gotten a bid. But by then it
was too late. By then I was
tagged a GDI.

1 owe a great deal to David-
son: friendships. a good educa-
tional background, and more.
But I could never come back as
a student. And I could never al-
low my son or my friend to
come to Davidson until some
change is brought about. Be-
cause, as it is, the chance is
too great of being a “reject.”

So I urged the IFC to do
something: discuss: look at
Rush programs at other schools
(I'd be glad to explain the sys-
tem at my school); consider the
individuals involved; and make
a change. It would surely be
for the better.

Dear Editor:

As a parent of a Freshman I
should like to express my ap-
preciation to Davidson for the
gracious hospitality extended to
us freshman parents last week-
end. From our first moment on
campus I was haunted by a
strange time-illusion—the feel-
ing of having lost my perspec-
tive of the here and now. Reluc
tantly I succumbed to this sense
of timelessness and indulged
myself in a sense of enjoyment
similar to the recapturing of a
melody that had for years elud-
ed me. or of finding reality in
the gossamer.of dreams, or of
quieting a homesickness grown
out of a forgotten yearning.

This was the place I had.
spent an idyllic Saturday after-
noon with a dynamic young
man whom I loved very much
when I was not quite six. This
young man had graduated from
Davidson seven years before
and had brought me back to see
his school and share some me-
mories as only a young child
can. We returned to a favorite
professor's widow, her teenage
son entertained me in the_gar-
den.

This was so very iong ago,
but I remember the sunlight
sifting through the pale green
leaves of early spring, and how
the young son lavishly filled
my arms with lilacs and white.
violets. When his mother re-
called us to the living room,
we had tea from an antique
silver teapot and wafers as thin
as snowflakes. When we said
goodbye, I climbed into the car
and fell asleep almost at once.
As my muscles relaxed, the
flowers I had been holding spill-
ed all over me.

Upon awakening sometime
later I remember peering
through the Hlacs and deciding
it had all been a delightful
dream. Of course the young man
who had taken me to Davidson
was my father. How strange to
think of him then as nearer my
son's age now than my own!

I did not return to Davidson
again until my own college
days. and the occasion was
Prom-Time. Such gaiety arid
recklessness are fun to remem-
ber even though the days were
threatened by the urgency of
war. The orchestras played on
even as our dancing partners
turned to soldiers while the
ominous clouds of World War
IT engulfed us.

And now I've reached the
third phase of Davidson's place
in my life—the best time of all
—the time when our son be-
comes a part of the pattern of
your days.

Time goes so fast. and then
suddenly it stops, and frag-
ments all out of context get
mixed up in a single moment.
As we left your campus after
this Freshmans Parents' Week-
end, our daughter, just barely
seven, climbed into the car with
her arms filled with extravag-
ently colored leaves. As she
Gozed off to sleep, her muscles
relaxed, and the lovely leaves
spilled over her. I smiled as I
watched her, for I knew when
she awoke and peered out be-
tween the leaves, exactly what
she would think—that it had all
been a delightful dream.

Thank you, Davidson, for an-
other memorable weekend.
