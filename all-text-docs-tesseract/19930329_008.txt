Reduced Shakespeare Company Delights Love Audience

By Katherine Salt

The Abridged History of
America presented by the Reduced
Shakespeare Company was witty,
imaginative, crazy, critical and to
top it all off, truthful. The com-
pany, formed in 1981 in San Fran-
cisco, delivered a history lesson
unlike any other at Davidson Col-
lege or any other college and uni-
versity, for that matter.

Spanning atime period of over
one thousand years, the company
of three raced smoothly around the
stage changing props and costumes
while relating the American story.
From the slaughtering of the Na-
tive Indians to the scandals of Presi-

Marley
Reggae

By Rice Lacey

“Y ou’ ll be here after the
concert, right?”

“NO problem, mon,” re-
sponded our taxi-cab driver. All
eight of us proceeded down the
Street, a huge target for all the
vendors.

You could tell we were in a
third world country, but it was not
until we came up on the crowd that
we noticed the tropical breeze and
flora of Jamaica.

As we entered the hotel com-
pound, I forgot all about our cab
driver. We would worry about a
ride after seeing Ziggy Marley.

Caught in the crowd follow-
ing the path, we descended the
tree-lined hill overlooking the stage
and floor. On the other side of the
floor the ocean sprayed against the
cliffs and beach. Still more or less
together, we all scattered along the
sand, with our backs to the water
and wind.

The stage was elaborately lit,
and before I had achance to survey
the crowd, Julian Marley, Bob’s
son, took the stage.

When I had bought our tickets
earlier that day I had no idea the
magnitude of the event. The
Marleys had never previously per-
formed together. Mother and
widow Rita Marley energized the
people with Bob’s “Lively Up
Yourself,” and her classic tune “So
High.”

As vendors kept us well sup-
plied with Red Stripe, we danced

to Ziggy Marley and the Melody

Makers. I gradually moved closer
and closer with the show’s build-
ing intensity. After “Tomorrow
People” and some tracks off his
new album, Ziggy grooved into
some of Bob’s hits.

The rest of the Marley family
shortly joined him to jam to many
of our favorites, but the songs were
only partof the night. Isoon found
myself at the front of the stage and
speakers; the rastafarians, all
around me, swung their dreadlocks.

Before I knew it was over, I
was being led up the hill and out to
the street again. Luckily, our taxi-
_ cab driver hadn’t forgotten us and

‘ took us to our hotel.

dent Nixon and from the travails of
factory women to the antics of
female comedian Lucille Ball the
company mixed American past-
times with American politics. In
doing so they delved deep into
American souls, ideals and priori-
ties.

Beginning with the line “It’s
not the length of your history, it’s
what you’ ve done withit,” the play-
ers proceeded to show the progres-
sion of the American nation as it
has destroyed whatever or whom-
ever was in its path in order to gain
wealth and power. As one player’s
lines went happily: “Christopher
Columbus was the first to slaugh-

ter the native Indians and become
wealthy in the process. Yet that
makes him the first, true blooded
American.” The story line contin-
xued in an amazingly interesting
and complex fashion as it incorpo-
rated the Battles of Lexington and
Concord with the Grassy Knoll
and the shooting of John F.
Kennedy.

The bullet used in this skit re-
emerged in a skit depicting the
death of Lincoln, thus creating a
truly hilarious and insightful play.
Skits like these re-occurred
throughout the two hour comedy.
The wonderful use of audience par-

tion and humor helped toease

“ equal— Ha, ha, ha!

over the very political and upset-
ting ideas that seemed to be the
basis and the reason for the play.
Such lines as “All men are created
!” spoken by the
founding fathers were a subtle way
of expressing the inequalities that
exist in our society. The actors did
a terrific job of winging it as vari-
ous unexpected things happened
throughout the play. It became
more enjoyable as even the actors
themselves could not control their
laughter at several of the jokes.
Despite the humorous mo-
ments, it cannot be denied that the

’ presentation gave a very negative

impression of America, its people

The band Electro-luxe is quickly growing in popularity throughout the area.

A Chat with Davidson's Resident
Rock and Roll Stars, Electro-luxe

By Thomas Bavis: ”

Electro-luxe is a hard name to
avoid these days, especially on the
Davidson campus. Hardly amonth
goes by that this band does not
have a show in the area, and hardly
a show takes place that is not sup-
ported by Davidson students. If
you have ever seen them live or
heard their tapes, no explanation
of their popularity isneeded—they
are afun band. When spoke with
them on Thursday night, I found
that the band members, like their
music, have the same attitude; they
were witty and nerdy, and they
refused to stay serious for long.

I spoke with the band—drum-
mer Michael Glaser, bassist Frank
Guzek, and guitarists Randolph
Lewis and John Morris—at their
house in Davidson. This is what
they had to say.

Davidsonian: Have y'all gradu-
ated?
John: Well, Randy and I both
graduated:in 1991 as English ma-
jors. Michael graduated last year
as a music major. Frank?

Frank: 1m still in school, as a
music major. I guessI’m the spring
chicken of the band. -
Davidsonian: {hate to shatter the
image of a rock and.roll lifestyle,

but you all have jobs, don’t you?

Michael: Yeah, we all have jobs
besides Electro-luxe. We have to
pay the bills. But we make a lot of

. time to do band stuff, especially

recording.

Davidsonian: What’s the record-
ing process like?

Randy: We have a “‘studio” in my
bedroom—actually just a lot of
recording equipment in a corner of
my room. But it's decent equip-
ment, and the recordings are of
fairly high quality.

John: Sometimes we play demos
for people and they’ll ask where
we recorded them. Many are very
surprised we did them in our own
house, just the four of us.
Davidsonian: Isuppose it’sanatu-
ral tendency for someone to o6m-
pare a new band to groups ofthe
past. WhenIlistened to yoursongs,
the Beatles and Big Star came to
mind. Who do you think has most
influenced your sound?

Randy: I grewup onthe Beatles, as
did John, and I guess it’s fair to say
they were an influence. They did
somuch with recording techniques,
which is something we have toyed
with a lot lately. What was the
State of art recording equipment
for them twenty-five years ago is

, Similar to the setup we have. Sol

have learned a lot from them about
how to craft a song onto tape.
John: Big Star had an influence on
me. They knew how to make a
good pop song.

Frank; \ din't listen to much music
as akid. In fact, I didn’t buy any
tapes until I was in high-school
The first two tapes I bought were
by Iron Maiden and The Cure.
John: That explains‘a lot Frank.

Michael: We’ve all listened to a

lot of different types of music
through the years, especially cut-
ting-edge music like the Smiths
and R.E.M., and a lot of it inevita-
bly finds its way into our songs.
Davidsonian: What about playing
live, do you enjoy that?

John: Oh, yeah. It’s a good way of

trying out new material on people,

and it’s fun to perform.
Davidsonian: Are there any shows
in the near future for Electro-luxe?
Michael As a matter of fact, we
have two shows next week: the
first one is on Thursday the first, at
the Double Door. The second is at
the Milestone on Saturday the third,
and that’s a big show for us. We’re
headlining there for the first time,
a big turnout would bring us inex-
plicable joy. |

and its history. The sad partis that
every negativeinnovation was true
to the core of American priorities
and actions and everyone in the
audience seemed to know it. The
brilliant backtracking through the

.timeline of American history

brought a’sigh of both relief and
disappointment as the audience
became aware of how destructive
American history has been. To the
idealistic historian and the fanati-
cal patriot the play would have
been a disgrace. To those who are
not afraid to admit the truth and
who have a sense of humor, it was
two hours of fun and brilliantly
imaginative acting.

‘It's Oscar

Time Again:
Our Picks

By Scott McLean

Well folks, it’s Oscar time
again. Somehow that doesn’t seem
to mean much this year though,
partially because it was such a poor
year for good cinema, but mainly
because the Academy of Motion
Pictures of Arts and Sciences al-
ways rewards the most politically
correct films of the year instead of
those pictures and performers who
are truly deserving. Sometimes
the two coincide, but this is very

~ rare indeed.“ Every time I think of

Oscar’s 1985 snub of “The Color
Purple” I must admit that I get a
little misty, and that is just one in
the long line of Academy disses.
The Academy has not made much
ground this year, which is particu-
larly ironic considering this year’s
theme is “Women in Movies.” Oh
well, whatare you going todo? All
Ican do is sort through this year’s
nominees and try to pick the bestof
the crop. _May the Force be with
me!
Best Actor: Robert Downey,
Jr., Chaplin; Clint Eastwood,
Unforgiven; Al Pacino, Scent of a
Woman; Stephen Rea, The Crying
Game; and Denzel Washington,
Malcolm X. The three top con-
tenders for this award are
Eastwood, Pacino, and Washing-
ton, but I suspect the competition
will boil down to a face-off be-
tween Pacino and Washington.
Washington deserves to win this
one without a doubt (and anyone
who saw Malcolm X would tell
you the same), but the Academy
will probably go with Pacino since
hehas been passed over eight times
already (for much better roles too).
However, the recent revelation
about some illicit doings‘on the
part of Scent of a Woman produc-
ers in regards to Pacino’s Golden
Globe win could provide a back-
lash against him. This one might
actually be an interesting race this
year, but who knows for sure?
Best Actress: Catherine
Deneuve, Indochine; Mary
McDonnell, Passion Fish;
Michelle Pfeiffer, Love Field: Su-
san Sarandon, Lorenzo’s Oil; and
