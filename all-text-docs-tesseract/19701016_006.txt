NEW GROUPS NEED MONEY

Demand Surpasses Activity Fund

By BILL ESKRIDGE
Staff Writer

The Activities Fund has
remained stabie and conse-
quently inadequate as re-
quests have become _ pro-
gressively higher each year

according to Dean of Stu-.

dents Richard C. Burts Jr.
‘When we had $23,000 ten
years ago, it was generally
adequate for our needs,”’
said Burts, ‘‘but three years
ago, the fund was still
$25,000 and ‘was greatly in-
adequate.”

The only _ organizations
which usually receive money
are the Quips and Cranks,
THE DAVIDSONIAN, the
Wildcat Handbook, the Mis-

cellany, the Apntist Series,
and the Student Govern-
ment,

This part of the Davidson
College budget is generally
misunderstood by ‘the student
body, although the activities

Housing

By DOUG BROWN

The problems — resulting
from the change in the hous-
ing of dates for homecoming
weekend have generally
been solved according to Di-
rector of Student Housing,
(Mrs. Peter Nicholls.

Normally rooms for over

600 dates are made availa- —

ble in Belk and Richardson
for homecoming weekend.
Mrs. Nicholls estimated this
practice has gone on for the
last fifteen to twenty years.
As a result of a petition,
this practice has been dis-
continued: Dates will be
housed-in homes in the local
community, and the Student
Housing Office is acting as a
clearing house for dates.
“Tt is difficult to Say
whether this procedure will
be better,’ Mrs. Nicholls

said. ‘‘Ordinarily this” of
fice, along with the jani-
tors, would be working

quite hard making arrange-

ments,"’ commented Mrs.
Nicholls.
Students may find that

these changes may cause
difficulties, and Mrs. Nic-
holls felt more responsibili-
ty is placed on the students.
It is now, necessary for stu-
dents to get out and find a
place for their dates to stay.

Mrs. Nicholls has heard
no complaints about the
new. procedure. She felt it
was important to be patient
and not to panic.

‘The housing. of dates in.

town is no financial saving
to the college according to
Mrs. Nicholls. “The housing
of dates in’ Belk and Rich-
ardson has been a self-sup-
porting thing,’’ she said.

Mrs.. Nicholls believes. stu-
dents will have to be ‘more
considerate towards the peo
ple their dates are staying
with. - »

fee is one of the most im-
portant charges exacted by
the college from ‘students.

Allocation of money from
the Activities Fund is con-
trolled by a committee con-
sisting of Treasurer Robert
Currie, Professor of Math-
matics Richard R. Bernard,
Union Director C. Shaw
Smith and Burts, the chair-
man of the committee.

According to Burts, the
explicit purpose of the com-
mittee is to, ‘Seek to place
the funds to the best use and
to seek the best judgment it
could get.”’

The committee pursues its
job by soliciting student or-
ganizations: and accepting
requesis for money submit-
ted by these organizations.

“Of course, the ‘askings’
always exceeded the amount
of money to be granted,
but this did not really b¢

Problem

There have been complaints
that students and their datés
often fail to go by the home
where she is to. stay until
it is time to take her home
in the early hours of the
morning.

Mrs, Nicholls pointed out.
that motels cancel rooms if
they are not claimed by a
designated time. She urges
that the same courtesy be
extended to ‘those in the
community housing dates.

_ religious:

come a problem until recent
years,’’ said Burts.

“Then, we were confront-
ed with major decisions on
where the money was to go.
It became a terrific job for
the commission to make al-
locations because of the
shortage of money."’

However, the _ situation
eased somewhat last year
when the allotment became
$31,000, an increase of $6,000
over the previous years.

This year, the situation is
