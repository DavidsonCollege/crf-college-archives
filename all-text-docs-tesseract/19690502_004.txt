Morgan

Associate Editor

American Civil Liberties
lawyer Charles Morgan criti-
cized college faculties and
administrations in an ad-
dress at the Davidson Chap-
ter of the American Associa-
tion of University Professors
spring banquet last Friday.

He heads the ACLU's South-
ern Regional office and Oper-
ation Southern Justice, which
is aimed at discrimination
against women and Negroes
in jury selection.

Morgan, a 38-year old At-
lanta lawyer, is known for

his defense of sucti notables
as Cassius Clay and Gr-
Howard Levy.

College administrations
should be “in charge of such
things as raising money, tak-
ing care of buildings, and
sweeping the floors,’ said
Morgan. The typical admin-
istration has “grown com-
pletely out of its original
function.”” he said. ©

“How can an institution
like Davidson justify a ROTC
program. voluntary or not?"
Morgan asked his surprised
audience.

Morgan emphasized that he

Established last year by

Lowenstein: Reason

Must Cure Society

By BILL LINEAWEAVER

Asst. Managing Editor
He speaks without notes.
quoting liberally from a wide
selection of sources: Robert
McNamara, Martin Luther
King, Robert Kennedy, Rob-
ert Kennedy quoting Aeschy
lus.

He speaks softly, almost
gently, and his hands are as
important in his talking as
his voice. or at least they
seem to be used as much.

His speeches are low-key
and filled with satire and lit-
eracy. They sound :political
largety because of the speak-
er's profession. In someone
else’s mouth, they could pass
for a good introductory lec-
ture on the problems on
American society.

He is against the war, the
draft, student (and other)
violence, the ABM system
and swollen defense spend-
ing. He is for increased do-
mestic programs in almost
every possible area.

Also, he is the man many
people credit with starting
the movement that culminat-
ed in the resignation of Lyn-
don Johnson.

This politician is Allard L.
Lowenstein. United States
Congressman from the Fifth
District of Long Island. He
spoké Monday night at N. C.:
State in Raleigh and at Chap.
el Hill.

In Raleigh, a mixed crowd
of students and faculty in
coats and ties IUstened to

Lowenstein over banquet
tables. Lowenstein spoke on
the ‘war, the ABM, and a
hos? of other matters. His
style was an improbable mix-
ture of Adlai Stevenson and
Mort Shal, and the audience
reacted in kind; most were
very Interested, several ang-
ered, many amused, some
disappointed and some mov-
ed.

They were interested be-
cause of his intensity. He
seemed to believe what he
was saying. Words like
“commitment” were used in
a way that transcended
cliche.

The crowd laughed at his
burlesque of official reason-
ing. ‘‘We have to keep bases
for obselete airplanes opers-
tive in Spain, according to
the Pentagon, because Fran-
co, whom we all know as a
faithful ally and a defender
of freedom. must be defend-
ed against any threat, like
insurrection in the Spanish
colonies in Africa.

“There are Spanish colo-
nies in- Africa. two of them.
Spanish Sahara and Ifni. The
Pentagon must have visions
of thousands of natives swim-
ming the Mediterranean with
their camels to topple Fran-
co in another evil People's
Revolution.

“The only thing I can say
to it is that that story must
have been devised to make
the arguments in favor of the
ABM system sound compara-
tively plausible.”

Lowenstein spoke of a ‘‘fun-
damental sickness of Amer-
fean society that provokes
legislators to put ‘‘useless
missles” in a higher priority
than school lunches or pov-
erty programs. There were
frowns,

One elderly professor turn-
ed sideways at the words,
“We are reaping the fruits
of racism."

Several of the students were
disappointed. They came to
hear some sort of litany of
revolt. “We have to work
from within the system to
change it,” said Lowenstein.
He quoted from the consti-
tution and the Declaration of
Independence. ‘“‘Viotence is
totally unacceptable,” he
sald.

Humor was replaced by an
anxious note as he ended.
‘We were defeated in Chi-
cago. but the big men lost
the war. What can Daley and
Jolmson do now, anywhere?"
“God has blessed this nation
with the greatest potential in
history. Those who turn ‘o
violence or apathy don't re-
alize that we have just begun

After he had repeated his
speech to students at a Chap-
el Hill lecture hall. he went
to a room in the Union and
talked with about 30 stu-
dents, answering questions
and sharing a communal
milkshake.

“People with brains have
doubts and somehow have
trouble acting,” he sand.
“The kooks don't have the
brains to doubt, so they act,
ripping up cities and cam-
puses. The vast middie group
has to be awakened to use
their brains and act as best
they can to get the initiative
back from the kooks.

lapses, there won't be any

anything helped. This society
must be made viable; there
aren't any feasible alterna-
tives.”

funds of the College Union.

May said closer supervi-
sion of funds will be exercis-
ed in the future so that the
foundation's board may be
more familiar with how the
money is used.

“The Activities Grant
Foundation is the one place
at. Davidson where a person
can turn for money to fi-
nance a worthy project. If
the foundation can't grant
the request, we can often di
rect the person to other
sources,’ said May.

did not question the need for
a standing army, but he said.
“Let the military finance its
own education program.”

Condemning the use of ‘a
double standard, one for
whites and one for blacks,"
Morgan said, ‘“‘nothing good
has ever come from a distinc-
tion based on race.”

“Something is wrong with
a school which has only four
black students,"’ Morgan said.

In the question and answer
period following his address,
Morgan was asked about the
Levy case. Declining direct
comment on the case since
its appeal is still in court,
Morgan did comment on mili-
tary justice.

“It's impossible to have

justice in a military court,” |

he said.

Detailing court-martial pro
cedure, Morgan said the
court was composed of peo-
ple “working for the gener-
al* and added that despite
concientious efforts. such a
court could not be completely
fair.

Having lost early rounds in
the Levy court battle, Mor-
gan said he is ‘now testing
the constitutionality of the
charges.” The” next steps

could lead to the third Cic-
cuit Court of Appeals and
then possibly to the Supreme
Court.

Sadler Quiet On Policy,
Awaits Election Results

Thomas S. Sadler, the next
Mayor of Davidson, intends
to hold an organizational
meeting of the new Town
Council during the week af-
ter the May 6 election, before
announcing any plans.

Sadler, who is the only can-
didate running for the ‘town's
executive office, said of his
program, ‘I don't think we
have anything we would like
to go out on a limb for now.”

Nine candidates have filed
for the five council seats to
be filled in the election. Four

Sadler plans to hold all

In the interest of better
communication between town
officials and the people, Sad-
ler enthusiastically invited
representatives of the press
to attend council functions.

Sadler, now an incumbent
councilman. did not give con-
crete information about * his
ideas on such issues as street
paving and housing code cn-
forcement yet. He took a cool
stance toward the proposed

however.

said.

Sadler was optimistic about
the new town council he wiil
be working with. “Of course

quest for an appointment ‘to
share more fully" with him
the students’ concern over
the war and the draft.

The signers say, ‘‘We will
act according to our consci-
ence. Along with thousands
of our fellow students, we
campus leaders cannot par-
ticipate in a war which we
believe to be immoral and
unjust. . . . We publicly and
collectively express our in-
tention to ‘refuse induction
and to aid and support those
who decide to refuse. We will
not serve in the military as
long as the war in Vietnam
continues."

The signers come from ivy
league, big ten, denomina-
tional, teacher and commun-
ity colleges.

“Mr. President,” the letter
signed by nine of the students
said. ‘‘We urgently write to
you now... . to advise you

that enany of the basic ques-
tions students and other con-
cerned Americans have rais-
ed about our purposes in Vi-

BASS CLEANERS

etnam remain unanswered.

. . We must now number
ourselves among those stu-
dents who cannot at this
time square military duty
with integrity and consci-
ence.”

The overall statement also
said: ‘‘Most of us have work-
ed in electoral politics and
through other channels to
change the course of Amer-
ica‘s foreign policy and to re-

“move the inequities of the

draft system. We will con-
tinue to work in these ways.
but the possible results of
these efforts will come too
late for those whose defer-
ments will soon expire. We
must make an agonizing
choice: to accept induction
into the armed forces, which
we feel would be irrespon-
sible to ourselves, our coun-
try. and our fellow man; or
to refuse induction. which is
contrary to our respect for
law and involves injury to
our personal lives and ca-
reers.”’
