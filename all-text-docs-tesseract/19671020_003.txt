‘“svithout any assoecinted pra:

He emphasized that he was

CHAMBERS BUILDING

ED. NOTE: Tha following was written by
President Martin when he was oditer of THE

DAVIDSONIAN in 1931.

Much has been written and more said of the -
beauty, usefulness, and. particularly, the preser
vation of the Chambers Building, bul, unless one
knows Davidson well, he cannot realize the vast
importance of this building in the life of the
school. One has only to realize that all classes,
excepting chemistry and R. 0. T. C,, meet in

. Chambers, and that all the offices of the adminis-
tration are there, 10 understand hew essential the
building is in the operation of the college.

It seems almost impossible that Davidson
could have heen kept running after the fire which
destroved Old Chambers, when there was ho ad-
ministration building, and classes were held in
Shearer, ln houses in the town, and in other in-
convenient places, It was only through the per-
severence of Davidson leaders, and the generosity
of Davidson men that disasler was averted. Bven
after the construction of the south wing of the
new cdifice. it is hard to understand how the work
was so successfully carried on, *

Now that we have the whole building com-
pleted, surrounded by grounds that are being
improved every day. amply providing facilities
for the entire system of education, it is important
that we keep in mind at all times the care and
preservation of this virtual center of Davidson
activity. This has been done in an admirable man-
ner in the past and should be continued during all
future Davidson generations. Only in this way will
we be able to have an adininistration building of
which all Davidson men can be proud.
