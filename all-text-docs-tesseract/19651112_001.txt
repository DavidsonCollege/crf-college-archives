NUMBER NINE

By LINDSAY DAVIS
Davidsonian Staff Writer

Jan. 15, 1965—The Davidson
College faculty voted to take a
stand on the most controversial
problems facing North Carolina
for many years, perhaps ever.

Its stand was to actively pro-
test against the infamous Speak-
er Ban Law of 1963.

Soon after the passing of the
law, the local chapter of the
American Association of Uni-
versity Professors, headed by
Dr. J. H. Ostwalt, appointed a
representative to talk with leg-
islators about the details of the

passage of the law and to get a
copy of the bill.

In April, 1964, the chapter was
ready to appoint a committee
to draw up a forma! statement of
opposition to the law. Advised by
certain political leaders to with-
hold the statement until after
the elections, the committee
waited until January, 1965.

From then on the faculty as a
whole worked closely with par-
ties in Raleigh for the repeal,
writing letters, publishing ar-
ticles and making talks to civic
organizations urging support for
their stand.

The committee, chaired by Dr.
R. E. Gift, consists of William
L. Bondurant, director of a
alumni activities, and Profs.
Louise Nelson, Locke White and
W. B. Patterson. These five,
along with Ostwalt, drew up the
statement which the faculty vot-
ed to release in mid-January,
1965.

Then they began to work on
the current project, an article
for the AAUP’s publication,
which is concerned with aca-
demic freedom of expression.

When asked about the content
of the article. Patterson divid-

Trustees May Restrict
Franchise Of Faculty

Faculty voting on matters of
college policy may be limited
only to full professors and asso-
ciate professors under an
amendment approved by the
Board of Trustees at its meet-
ing here last month, THE DAV-
IDSONIAN learned this week.

The measure has not become

official. because it must receive
a second approval of the board
at the next meeting of the
Trustees.

No announcement of the ac-
tion of the Trustees was made
following the meeting on Oct.
22; however, other amendments,
including the elimination of the

Criticism At Open End

Changes in the method of pre-
sentation of information about
Honor Court trials and in the
penalties for violation of the
Honor System will be discussed
in an Open End program. next
Wednesday.

The program is being spon-
sored by the Honor Court to al-
low students to express their
opinions on the two issues. The

Court decided to have the pro-
gram in a meeting last Monday
which was called to consider the
present situation of the Honor
System.

Court Chairman Jim Stokes
stated, “The two matters that
have been mentioned seem to be
the most vital questions to ans-
wer, so it is hoped that the Open
End discussion will concern just
these issues.”

Stokes said that there are
three possible methods of pre-
senting information about Honor
Court trials to the student body.
“The present method of attémpt-
ing to keep complete secrecy
could be maintained. Or the
transcript of a trial could be
published with the reasoning
which led to the Honor Court’s
decision appended to it.

“Or a trial open to the stu-
dent body at large could be
held. The Court will discuss
these alternatives at the Open
End,"* added Stokes.

The second issue to be raised

Freshmen
Plan For
Parents

The Freshman Council
finalized its outline for the
Parents’ Day program sche-
dule last Wednesday even-
ing and included in its plans
name tags and guided tours
for parents.

The Council will greet and
give name tags to the parents
during registration beginning at
9 a.m. Members of the Council
will then guide the parents
around the campus in tours be-
ginning every 15 minutes. Dan
Mombrea, who is in charge of
the tours, handed out booklets
about Davidson at the meeting
so that Council members could
give a more detailed tour of the
campus than all the individual
students.

Council President Bayard Mil-
ler will address the parents after
a banquet in Chambers. His
speech will concern the new out-
look of the Freshman Class
caused by the delayed rush of
fraternities. Later in the after-
noon, Craig Wilson will hold an
open house planned at the ROTC
Department.

The Union will not serve lunch
on Parents’ Day. Students are
invited to the banquet whether
or net their parents are coming.
Free tickets must be picked up
at the Union desk.

is the possibility of establishing
a gradation of penalties for vio-
lations of the Honor System.

Concerning this question
Stokes said. ‘‘The Court: would
like to disucss the insertion of
the word ‘ordinarily’ in Article

VII, Section 5 of the Student!

Body Constitution so that it
would read, ‘Every student
found guilty of violating any séc-
tion of this article shall ordinari-
ly be dismissed from the col-
lege.”

Stokes expressed his belief
that “‘constructive discussion of
these two issues at the Open End
will lead to changes which will
improve Davidson's Honor Sys-
tem.””

“Man's prerogative is
finding the great new pro-
blems of our day,” Dr. Rich-
ard I. Levin said at chapel
Tuesday. ~*

Dr. Levin was the second
speaker in a series of lectures
sponsored by the Economics De-
partment.

After being introduced by Dr.
Louise Nelson, Dr, Levin pro-
mised to use “the gut approach”
in his talk and to lend color to
the subject by use of concrete
examples.

“Somewhere, I'm sure,"’ be
began, “the president of West-
inghouse has just come to
work,” This man is primarily
concerned with what the com-
pany’s 100,000 or so employees
are doing. He doesn't worry
about details of operation like
the delivery of an order of light
bulbs, but about overall corpor-
ate strategy.

Dr. Levin raised the question,
“How can he divorce his at-
tention successfully from the
light bulb issue with any degree
of assurance that the bulbs will
be delivered?"’ The answer is
that Westinghouse uses a vast
computor system to take care
of a rather complex series of
accounting and inventory pro-
cedures.

en tee,

This system works faster and
better than humans could. In
the future, according to the
speaker, “routine operating de-
cisions will not be made by peo-
ple."' However, the demand for
the man who can make strateg-
lie, creative decisions will in-
‘ crease.

Dr. Levin next turned his at-
tention to a hypothetical situa-
tion concerning the sales mana-
ger of the Esso Standard Oil
Company. Because of the di-
verse possible products of crude
oil, the later faces the question,
‘What shall we make and sell

explained to news media imme-
diately after the meeting. .

When asked by THE DAVID.
SONIAN why the action was not
explained along with other de-
tails of the meeting of the
board, College President D.
Grier Martin stated that he over-
looked.the details of this amend-
ment after the meeting.

Many faculty members re-
acted rather strongly to news of
the voting proposal this week.
“Phe whole air of secrecy sur-
rounding this thing is incredi-
ble,“” remarked one professor.

As of late yesterday afternoon,
faculty members had not been

officially notfied of the Trus-|:

tees’ proposal.

At Tuesday's faculty meeting
one professor reportedly inquir-
ed of Dean of Faculty Frontis
W. Johnston, who was presiding
in Martin's absence, as to the
basis of the rumor concerning
the amendment. The dean stated
that he was not familiar with
the details of such a proposal
but would check into the mat-
ter.

Early today Martin notified
faculty members that he would
meet with any interested profes-
sors this afternoon to discuss
the matter.

better have an answer.”

Here again the use of com.
puters and advanced mathe-
matical technipues shows what
is the best use of the raw ma-
terial to satisfy certain criteria.
This can be done mechanically,
and the need of having men to
perform this type of task is fast
disappearing.

“The use of mature indivi-
duals to perform repetitive cal-
culations is an enormous social
waste,” Dr. Levin added. On
the other hand the: study of
optimization techniques is an
extremely vital task.

ed it into five general sections:
1) the political history of the
bill; 2) an analysis from the
constitutional viewpoint; 3) the
relationship of the law to aca-
demic freedom: 4) a discussion
of the law and national secur-
ity: and. 5) the effect on the
reputation, academic standing
and campus life. “This would
include,’ added Patterson. ‘‘spe-
cific cases of refusals of learn-
ed societies to meet on cam-
pus, plus the failure to obtain
certain pertinent speakers.”

The article itself is actually

“a result of a coalition with the |

University of North Carolina,
mostly Chapel Hill, but also
help from N. C, State and UNC-
G,.’”’ Patterson said. The draft-
ing began eight months ago and
is just now ready to be pub-

licized.
A special session of the legis-

lature will convene soon in Ra-
leigh to consider the recommen-
dations of the commission of
Gov. Dan K. Moore to study the
law.

In a nutshell, the commission
recommends that the regulation

versities be left to the discretion
of the trustees of the institutions.

“We are hoping,” continued
Patterson, “that the law can be
completely repealed. But that
is not likely. What will prob-
ably happen is that the law will
be amended in line with the
commission's recommendations,
with an agreement that the
trustees will adopt a_ policy
similar to that of the present
law.”

This is not complete victory,

is in the hands of the trustees
and not the state legislature.

OSTWALT

Though not a member of the
AAUP, Bondurant who holds the
LLB degree, worked with the
committee on the constitutional-
ity of the Speaker Ban. Be-
cause he is not a member of
the faculty, he is in a position
to voice his opinion of the fac.
ulty’s stand,

“Their decision,” he said.
‘came at a time when it was
common for people who spoke
out against the law to be labeled
sympathizers themselves.”

The faculty, however, had the
courage to speak out for its
convictions, Bondurant ven-
tured.

Faculty’s Opposition To Speaker Ban Law Continuing —

“For the first time." he con-
tinued, ‘since I've been here—
10 vears—Davidson College has
taken a public stand on a politl-
cal problem when the college
itself was not directly involved
in it.”

The Davidson faculty was one
of the state leaders in opposing
the new law which did not even
affect the college. However, the
faculty was and is so interested
in the status of higher educa-
tion in North Carolina that it felt
the need to protest this affront
to freedom and threat to accredi-
tation of the state consolidated

university.

Faculty Postpones
Drinking Question

Further
Report
Planned

No new action was taken
and no specific proposals
were made concerning the
new, faculty approved
drinking rule. at the faculty
meeting held this Tuesday.

Further discussion of the a-
mended rule and. its implica:
tion for the Social Council and
athletic trips is expected at the
faculty meeting in December,
when the joint Faculty-Trustee
Committee on Alcoholic Bev-
erage Policy will present a
further report on the contro-
versy.

Some concern has developed.
over the problem of maintaining
control of drinking by team
members on athletic trips under
the new ruling.

Dr. J. G. Martin, one of the
faculty members of the five-
man Faculty-Trustee Commit-
tee, reports that the committee
will study the opinion of the
coaches before the December
meeting. and that it may be
necessary to reconsider the com-
mittee’s original recommenda.
tions.

“But for now,” Dr. Martin
emphasized, “it is an entirely
open question. I'm not even sure
what I'm going to think after
these discussions.”
