Martin Shows High Optimism
As Cat Harriers Begin Season

By MARK CONNORS
Asst. Sports Editor

The Davidson cross-country
team opens its 1973-74 season
this Saturday with hopes of
having its best season in several
years.

Ending the past season with a
5-5 record, the Wildcats face
basically the same schedule as
last year. Tomorrow they open
with a 10-mile race on Stone
Mountain in Georgia. ‘‘It’s just
to give the team a taste of com-
petition before we open our
regular season next week,”
commented coach Sterling
Martin, head track and cross-
country coach.

“This squad is the best I've
had in at least three years,
commented Martin. ‘‘We've got
almost everybody back from
last year along with a couple of
outstanding freshman pros-
pects.”’

Captain and number one man
on the squad once again is
Ricky Bell, a junior from
Meredithville, Va.

“Ricky will probably be our
front runner but I’m expecting
freshman Coty Pinckney to be
right up there with him.”

Pinckney, winner of this
year's Freshman Cake Race,
hails from Alexandria, Va. He
is also one of the bright pros-
pects for the Davidson track
team this year.

Another dark horse will be

freshman Greg Kunkleman,
who finished second behind Pin-
ckney in the cake race.

‘Another potential front run-
ner could be sophomore Jeff
Neikirk,’’ said Martin.
‘‘Although Neikirk is new to the
cross-country program, he was
one of the Cat’s leading half-
milers last spring on the track
team. ‘Jeff is in really fine
shape and could very well
challenge Ricky for the number
one spot,’’ added Martin.

Besides three or four prospec-
ts for the top position the Wild-
cat harriers have several retur-
ning lettermen to make for one
of the most well-balanced
teams in a long time.

Juniors Ricky Deal and Bob
Lautensack should form a
strong backbone for the squad.

Sophomores Chuck Sudetic,
Steve Scroggs, Jesse Smith, Bill
Smith and Bill Cole will all be
battling for positions on the
squad.

“I'm also impressed with
John Barksdale, Jim Snead and
Buck Farrow,"’ said Martin.
‘They should help the squad by
adding even more depth.”

Very optimistic about the
season, Martin feels the key to
success will be to win the same
meets as last year and then
hopefully beat both The Citadel
and Appalachian,”’ according to
Martin.

with Calvin Allen and Frank
(foul ball) Folger, they will
easily be up there.

The other experienced team
in the league is ATO. Un-
fortunately, the now infamous
AT Zeroes only experience is in
the fine art of being good
loosers. Rumor had it last year
that the ATO’s invented the for-
feit. They lose better and more
often than any team C.A. has
ever seen.

Moving on the League 2, as
much as this reporter hates to
admit, the SPE’s seem to be the
top outfit in this bunch. The
SPE’s will rely greatly upon
their experience and
organization. Bill Higgins and
Bob (Air Ball) Horton anchor
the offense and defense respec-
tively.

PAX is going to give the
SPE’s a tough run as there is
more than just flickerball at
stake when these two teams
meet. PAX picked up quar-
terback Jay Powell who played
out his option with the Staten
Island Fairies. Powell should
give PAX a greatly improved
offense.

SAE’s second squad should
have the experience to hang
above the freshman teams in
this league, but you never know.

Ah yes, the freshman teams.

something to behold. C-1 has
potential, but another rookie

squad has caught C.A.’s eye.
The Altoona Aardvarks have
that added momentum that
comes from a screwy name.
The AA's took seven out of
eleven watermelons at the
freshman outing, and were also
responsible for saying ‘‘Hi to
Momand ABC-TV”’ last Satur-
day. Look for these gentlemen
to go a long ways.

C.A. calls his own number in
League 3 as the Staten Island
Fairies will be back. Unbeaten
before basketball practice star-
ted last season, the Fairies will
have to rebound from the loss of

Jay (Nelson ) Powell, whoplayed

out his option following contract
disputes. The services of all-
IMAC end Steve Gadaire will
also be missed on the Fairies.
Gadaire was shelved for the
season by a foot injury.

Recruited to assist all-IMAC
performance Joe Duncan and
Larry Horowitz are Kirk Com-
be, Ken Schmader, and Jim
(Wimpo) Sitterson. Sitterson
was obtained for no one. It’s felt
that the Wimps came out ahead
on the deal.

The Pikas will be tough in this
league led by fleet-footed Jim-
my Boyd. The Pikas always
score a lot of points and might
come out on top if thier defense
comes through.

As Champs —

enough players. Chip (the
Phantom) Stone and Johnny
Rodgers (no, not the little guy
who played for Nebraska) will
lead the inexperienced outfit.
Tennis coach Jeff Frank will
pitch in also.

C-2-B, sister team of C-1-A
will bring up the rear. I hope
they can keep it up. Freshman
are known for their flickerball
ineptness, so when a hall splits
up they are begging to be
decimated. Look for these two
squads to be the turkeys of the
campus this fall.

League 4 is the strongest
overall league. C.A. has got to
go with the tribe, the Cleveland
Indians. Names such as
Rodgeman, Sanchez, Plem-
mons, and ‘“‘Big Bad"’ John Bird
will be flickering their way to
notoriety all season long.

Look for PDG and SAE to bat-
tle right behind the Tribe.
Should Cleveland falter, C.A.
says that SAE will pick up the
crown. The Gamms just don’t
have the depth, but they do have
all-IMAC candidates Chris
Young and Marty Williamson.

League 5 is simple to predict.
(C.A. is real good at simple
things). The Delts are on top all
the way. No one will come close
to last year’s champs. Their
supply of jocks is
inexhaustable. They should
repeat as champs this year.

The KA's could be close, but
they lost some people and they
are in there with the Delts. C. A.
says, ‘‘Good luck.”
