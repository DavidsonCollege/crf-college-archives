* Letmetake this time to make
another impassioned plea for
Davidson’s return to the South-
ern Conference. I think the ad-
vantages implicit in such amove
are obvious, but Ill repeat them
anyway.

1. Competitive, established
rivalries.

2. A beneficial step up in the
level of competition in almost
every sport.

3. Member schools with ath-
letic and academic makeups rela-
tively similar to Davidson’s. The
other schools’ greater size seems
daunting, but when you’re the
smallest Division I school (and
Davidson is) itis something with
which you must live.

4. The Southern is a confer-
ence on the rise; the addition of
Georgia Southern, a Division I-
AA national champion in foot-
ball many times over, bringseven
greater respectability to a foot-
ball conference which already
includes Furman and the Cita-
del, both perpetual dwellers in
the I-AA top 20.

5. They have allowed us to
rejoin and to continue to play
football at the Division III level.
It seems to me that Davidson
would never have left in the first
place had not the trustees put to
death the I-AA football program
which was then a condition for
membership in the Southern.
-Please, please, please.

* Looking at the ease with
which Coastal Carolina got by
Augusta (their victim in the Big
South Tournament final) and
Jackson State (the casualty in the

rts Front

NCAA Tournament play-in
game) made me think that
Davidson, losers by just3 points
to the Chants in the semis, could
easily have followed the same
route to the NCAAs. And as the
only team in the Tournament
witha losing record (they would
have been 13-18), the ‘Cats
would have been offered up as a
sacrifice to those basketball dei-
ties in red and white, UNLV.
The horror, the horror.

* The Wildcats’ actual 10-19
finish was not a disappointing
one for me. Sure, there were
plenty of negatives; the team
seemed at times unable to break
apress or inbound the ball, turned
the ball over. with incredible
frequency, and gave away a
couple of close games (the OT
lossat UNC-Asheville, when the
Bulldogs hit two 3-pointers in
the final :05 to force overtime,
sticks in my mind). But it is im-
portant to remember that the team
was dominated by freshmen.

The starting lineup for most
of the year consisted of -four
freshmen, guards JasonZimmer-
man and Pat Holloway and for-
wards Janko Narat and James
Marsh, and sophomore center
Detlef Musch. Overall, freshmen
scored 60% of the team’s points,
played 56% of the minutes,
grabbed 47% of the rebounds
and accounted for 59% of the
assists. Keep in mind, too, that
freshmen Scott Alford and Ron
Horton, both major contributors
while healthy, missed most of
the season due to injury.

‘Cats End Week Of PerfectVictory

By Alan Rosselot

Davidson’s baseball team
capped a perfect week by crushing
Charleston Southern 15-0 in the
second game of a doubleheader on
Saturday at Wildcat Park.

This destruction of the Bucca-
neers concluded a three game
sweep of Charleston Southern, a
Big South foe, in addition to ex-
tending the Wildcats win streak to
five. The five victories include
these three as well as wins over
Duke and Lafayette.

The streak has brought the
Wildcats season record up to .500
at 12-12 (8-8 in the Big South).
The Wildcats hope to pull above
the even mark with a win over first
year program UNC-Greensboro
before they head to Hawaii over
Spring Break for the prestigious
Rainbow Classic. _

As demonstrated by their run
totals against Charleston South-
ern, the Wildcat bats have defi-
nitely been-a fact, in a winning
games. .

More importantly, however,
may be the strong performances
on the mound.

Pitchers Dave Williams, Brad
Wanzenberg, and Jim Stanfill al-
lowed only five runs in four games

this week. Williams (5-1) earned
two wins, Wanzenberg (3-2, one
save) picked up the save against
Duke anda win against Charleston
Southern, and Stanfill (1-0) held
Charleston Southern to one run.

Perhaps the biggest win of the
week came on Tuesday as the
Wildcats took advantage of three
errors by Duke’s third baseman,
Sean McNally, to score tworuns in
the sixth inning. The Wildcats held
onto beat Duke4-3. Williams gave
up three runs in seven innings and
Wanzenberg held the Blue Devils
scoreless for two innings to seal
the victory.

The Wildcats headed into the
weekend series against the Char-
leston Southern Buccaneers need-
ing wins to place themselves in
contention in the Big South. Other
Big South schools have yet to re-
ally begin their conference play.

- The Bucs proved to be exactly
what the Cats’ needed as ‘they
coasted to thrée easy victories. In
the first game of the series on Fri-

day, Stanfill overcameashaky start.

to hold the Bucs to only one run
while the Cats warmed up the
basepaths. The Cats rolled to an 8-
1 win.

Men's Tennis Stretches

ued its turnaround this week, in-

team), Sewanee and conference

a repeat performance as Williams
allowed only one run while pitch-
ing a complete game. Freshman
catcher Brett Boretti (2-3,3 RBIs),
designated hitter Steve Livesey (3-
3, 2 runs scored), and. shortstop
Rick Bender (2-4, 2 runs scored)
highlighted the Davidson attack.
Bender and first basemen Joe
Azzolino each hit homers as the
Cats walked away with a 6-1 vic-
tory.

In the final game of the series,
Wanzenberg pitched a complete
game shutout, allowing only four
hits while striking out five. In the
meantime, the Cats took advan-
tage of Buc errors to score eight
runs in the first two innings, six of
which were unearned. Of the fif-
teen Wildcat runs, seven were un-
earned.

The Wildcats take on UNC-
Greensboro on Tuesday at Wildcat
Park before they head to Hawaii on
Wednesday. In the Rainbow Clas-
sic, Davidson’s pitchers~ must
continue to have strong outings if
the Wildcats are to have a chance.

The Cats will play.a total of
nine games in nine days while in
Hawaii. The schedule includes
Wichita State and the University
of Hawaii, ranked 6th and 17th in
the nation, respectively.

Dale Voeks at number two and
Albie Varoskiand David Jespersen
atnumber three came through with

Frank hoped that winning a
close match would give the team a
needed confidence boost. Zabell
agreed with Frank.

“It’s good to know that wecan

. Said Zabell.

The ‘Cats had a1 an easier time
against Sewanee, winning 9-0.
Sewanee was a weaker team than
Washington College, but Frank
attributed the victory to a better
overall performance by Davidson.

The Wildcats carried their

Charleston Southern. Davidson
won the match in the singles por-
tion, scoring a 6-0 sweep.
