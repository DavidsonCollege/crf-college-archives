STUDENT COUNCIL . Our . newly
elected Student Couneil was installed last

zation iz one that receives iar too little
credit for the tremendously important work
that it does in governing the Student Rody

system of Siudent Government is built on
the Student Couneil and yet in a few weeks,
it would be a saie bet that hali the Student
Ivody could not name all the members o/ the
“couneil.

OPEN HOUSE... This seems well on the
toad to becoming an annual affair: li it is
continued we heartily recommend that in

that they are causing students quite a bit of
inconvenienee by lengthening their visits
past six olclock. First floor inhabitants

Ungentlemanly Behavior...

Editorials have been written and talks
have been made. but to no avail. We are
speaking of our conduct in chapel. At times
it becomes positively disgraceful. unworthy
of Davidson gentlemen. * Especiaily during
the devotional exercises each morning is it
inexcusable. I{ you have ever tried to con-
duct a chapel service, vou know how hard
it is even when, the most courteous atten-
tion is paid to Jour remarks, and the least
we can do is show the other fellow the same
courtesy that we would like to have. And
even if we don’t think enough of the speaker
or of our neighbor who is trying to listen to
the service, we should at least have enough
respect for ourselves to pay reverent atten-
tion. _

And then with regard to our conduct dur-
ing the Student Body meeting at the end of
the chapel period. A little fun is all very
well in its placé, bit there is such a thing
as carrying it too far. When important an-

“OUR ELECTION SPIRIT”

In many respects college Jive during
spring elections is abnormal. ‘The tension
prevalent over the campus is all to -eyident.
The average student becomes $o anxious to
see his man win, regardless of imerit, that
he casts aside his scruples along with’ the
crowd, and goes to any length to accomplish
his purpose: a

Somehow, this abnormal attitude has
come to be considered an integral part of
what wer ialsely term “iraternity spirit”
during the mad seramble to sce which lodge
will get the most campns offices. It has al-

-most become a fraternity competition, Rut
the social fraternities areznot the only of-
fenders. Too many “iriendly cliaues” and
“hall groups” stick their fingers in the po-
litical pie. And it is a pity that such a state
of atiairs exists.

Despite re-running of elections, individ-
ual politics move merrily on. Many a stu-
dent fills out the ballot of an absentee
without proxy. Too often ballots of oth-
ers are removed and destroyed by ardent
but insidious vote-getters who think
“that’s pretty smart.” Things reach a
pretty pass when an ordinarily conscien-
tious man lets his fraternity affiliations so
interfere with his honest judgment that,
in a board or staff election, he forgets the
merit of the man and backs his “brother.”

Yes, it is 2 strange state indeed. We sit
around and gripe how the clections come
out. We intimate that the vote-counting
was “erooked.” And we shir others for the
same things that we do ourselves. When
we do make ourselves realize that we are in
the wrong. we salve our conscienees with
the trite phrase “everybody else does it and
we have to deiend our rights.”

What can we do about it? In the first
place: we can stop saying that nothing can
be done about it. From there on, it is an
individual matter. If we refrain from these
practices as individuals, the eleetions as a
whole will be a jot cleaner and the results
a gteat deal more honest.

At-iong Tast, the Supreme Court ‘nas de-
cided to review the case involving the right
of the federal government to tax reocipts
for football games played by state colleges.
This particular case is brought by the Uni-
versity of Georgia, but other, state insti-
tutions have protested the payment of the
tax on admissions. Up to now, the Hederal
courts have sustained the state colleges in
their contention that football games are
-fundamental parts of the education program
of the state schools and thus exenipt from
federal taxation. Now the “nine old nen”
will have their say and the long drawn-out
litigation will be settled finally.

One course in the ‘everyday cur-
ricula of college students that is not
neglected’ is sleep—and the aver-
age collegian sleeps 56 hours every
week. At least those are the. facts
—determined by the University of
Wichita education class of Dean L.
Hekhuis. . .

“The tabulation showed,” the sur-
vey yreport said, “that the persons
working the mast hours studies the
frost. One student who works 50
hours,/in a local dry goods store
spends 26 hours in studying. On
the other hand a girl sleeping 60
hours, does no outside work and
studies but 10 hours.”

Another conclusion drawn from
the compilation was that the stu-
dent who sleeps the least spends
the most time studying.
