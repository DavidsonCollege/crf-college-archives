‘My main task is clearing Dracula’s name’

Florescu reveals Dracula’s
cryptic Romanian heroics

By GIL CUTHBERTSON
Staff Writer

Radu Florescu’s notoriety
as an authority on Dracula
means that wherever he goes
people expect him to be
wearing a black cape and
brandishing his fangs.

Florescu does not fit the
traditional role of a ‘‘Dracula”’
anymore than does the histori-
cal Romanian count that Flo-
rescu has made the subject of
his book, The Search For
Dracula.

As a result people ‘were
surprised to see the ‘Boston
College professor without his
cape and fangs on campus this
week to speak about scholar-
ship about “Dracula.”

How did Florescu get in-
volved with the process of
tracking Dracula down?

“I have always been utterly
fascinated by history and es-
pecially with field work and
research which I love. So when
another member of the Boston
College faculty approached me
about the possibilities of stu-
_dying Dracula, I jumped at
the chance,” said Florescu.

““Vampire’”’ a hero

Florescu sees one of his
main tasks to: be the clearing
of Dracula’s name.

“Count Dracula was sort of
a Robin Hood character to his
fellow Romanians. Most
people never suspect that
there actually was a Dracula
but he was actually a national
hero. I must stress that the
actual Dracula was. not a
vampire,’ said Florescu.

Even with a schedule of
lectures across the nation and
his teaching duties at Boston
College, Florescu still finds
time to explore. -

“I feel a professor should do
something besides go to his
classroom. I like to go to the
place where history happened.
Of course,’’ explained Flore-
scu, “now I get money from
my book which is doing very
well, and lectures, but I
roamed around long before I
had any money.”’

frightening conclusions

The search for history where
it happened is not without
problems. Florescu’s attempt
to discover Dracula’s castle in
the Romanian mountains
caused many problems, some
of which seem almost super-
natural. .

“We had a lot of trouble in
the search for Dracula’s cas-
tle,’’ said Florescu. ‘‘My uncle
was hurt very seriously when
he fell into a ravine and all of
us on the search were aflicted
with some sickness.

“The Romanians were very
helpful to us, which sort of
surprised me. There was a lot
of red tape though,’ said
Florescu.

Although Florescu does not
believe that his investigation
party to Dracula’s castle was
cursed, he does admit to
feeling a certain unsettling air
about the place.

“The people in Romania are
still very superstitious and
believe that vampires do exist.

I don’t subscribe to these
beliefs, but when we visited
the castle, I could feel some-
thing, something unnatural
and completely different about
the place,’’ said Florescu.

Florescu’s concern that his-
torical mysteries be solved has
driven him beyond his study
of Dracula. He has written
The Search For Frankenstein,
which attempts to get to the
basis for Mary Shelly’s novel.
He is now at work on his next
book, The Search For Blue-

... McArthur expresses

(continued from page 9)
been no continuity in recent Y
leadership, McArthur expres-
sed interest in planning meet-
ings and functions of the
entire staff ‘‘to allow fellow-
ship among Y Board mem-
bers. One of the basic princi-
ples of the Christian name in
the organization title denoted
openness--the Y is not a clique
or specific group keeping other
people out. :

“We want to make student
involvement in the Y and the
Davidson community as easy
as’ possible. We’re open to
all,” said McArthur. “We

stand as the middle ground
between the College Union and

the Davidson Christian Fel-
lowship.”’

The new cabinet expressed
hopes of establishing a strong
community program in the
Depot. ‘‘I think the depot is
the link of Davidson College
students with the extra-col-
lege community. We need to
be better informed of needs

and wants in the community,
however, before establishing a
Depot program,” said McArt-
hur.

“The Depot’s kind of like a
church. It just sits there
empty except for once a week.
At least we don’t air condition

or heat the building, though.”
