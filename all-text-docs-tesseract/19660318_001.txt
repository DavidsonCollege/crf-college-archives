THURMOND TALKS TO TV MAN
Coffee Hour Featured Sharp Questions

S. C. Senator Tries
Back-Home Politics

By LINDSAY DAVIS
Davidsonian Feature Editor
He spoke long and hard trying to make up for being
late. He said what he believed, but it seemed he geared
it to the folks back home he was politicking, and not to new members of the Honor

a college audience.

Strom Thurmond, U. S. Sena-
tor from South Carolina, visited
the Davidson campus Tuesday
and spoke during chapel. He was
delayed by weather and was
some 10 minutes late.

Speaking on “Freedom,” the
balding, but vigorous ex-general,
reopened his attack on the Dem-
ocratic administration in Wash-
ington. He charged that ‘*free-
dom js being destroyed by the
federal government.”

He divided his talk into two
definite parts, one dealing with
domestic and one with foreign
policy. The Constitutional Con-
vention of 1787, he said, “‘set up
a framework of government with
the greatest measure of free-
dom.":

DELEGATED POWER

Thurmond was especially up-
set by the trend of government
to enter realms of society in
which no power was delegated
to it. ‘‘No extraordinary powers
were delegated to one man or to
one organization.”

He praised the system of
checks and balances and the sep-
aration of powers in the federal
system. “The government,” he
continued, “has entered areas
where they have no right to be,
such as education and arts and
humanities.”

However, this is not his major
concern, as he said later in con-
versation with students. Rather.
foreign policy is his pet, and
sometimes his “‘pet peeve.”

He said that be stands behind
the President in his present pol-
icy in Viet Nam. Thurmond feels
a definite obligation to peace and
freedom in the world. ‘Do not
take freedom for granted. You
will lose it if you do,’ he warn-
ed. ‘
COMMUNIST THREAT

Communism is the present ele-
ment of tyranny and opponent

Studen

Because of a shortage of good
tickets, the student body was un-
able to sit as a group near the
court last weekend at the NCAA

of freedom in the world today.
as Hitler's Germany was a gen-
eration ago. ‘‘Thirty-six per cent
of the world’s population and
one-third of the land mass is now
behind the Iron Curtain,”* he said
in proving bis point.

Growing more and more ve-
hement, he lashed out at those
who advocate abandoning Viet
Nam to the Communists. ‘‘We
can't let the people down.”

As a buzz began to grow in
the audience; Thurmond launch-
ed a barrage of facts indicating
the growth. of Communism in
the last 20 years. Taking each
country at a time, he showed
that if the U. S. left Viet Nam,
the entire subcontinent of South-
east Asia would be overrun by
Communism.

CHINA WAR

“If you are to win,”’ he con-
tinued, ‘“‘you must take risks.”
To worry about ‘the Chinese en-
tering the war is foolish now, he
said, because they have been
supplying and directing it for
several years. ‘‘Therefore, we
must take the risk, supply the
power and crush the enemy.”

Thurmond was not upset by
the often sharp questions he en-
countered at the coffee, but was
happy to hear them. ‘'For a
while,’ he later remarked, “I
was ready to believe that the
young people did not have any
interest in their nation’s affairs,
but I have found that they do.”
Jokingly, he added, “Now, if
they only believed like me, the
Republican Party would be in
fine shape.”

The senator could not stay
long on campus, and had to
leave too soon after lunch at the
SAE house. He left behind many
of his beliefs, which, while not
always compatible with the stu-
dents’, at least left an impres-
sion and ideas to think about.

‘Committee Considers Proposal
To Abolish Required Vespers

A proposal to abolish re-
quired vespers and to sub-
stitute a vigorous program
of voluntary worship was

eligibility because of his partic-| considered by the faculty

There is a precedent to Mat-
thews’ election while attending
another school. In 1961 George
Trask was elected student body
president while spending his jun-
ior year at the University of
Vienna in Austria.

The recommendation was one

of several ideas which were dis-
cussed by the cuimrmittee con-
cerning the requiréd attendance
by students at religious services
at Davidson.

An ad hoe group of students
proceeded meanwhile with plans
for a boycott of vespers Sunday
night, despite the requests of
student leaders to withhold any
pressure during the committee's
current discussions.

The group distributed notices

night and posted notices on the

campus calling for a boycott of

“Sq what they did. was send
us some extra tickets they had

We had single tickets scattered
all over the Coliseum.”

Each of the four scitools was
allotted its 250 tickets in an op-

position of the tickets was such
that the group could sit as a

“These two groups took up

anyhow,” the athletic director
said.

“We felt these two groups

“I think St. Joseph's must not

Scott said. “But their students

After the 250 good seats had

the tickets gotten later.

current proposals and discus-
sions of. the committee as rea-
son for: their shift in support.

Meeting twice this week, the
committee originally heard two
proposals which were to com-
bine vespers and chapel cuts,
to hold vespers services every
other week instead of the present
weekly basis or to create a com-
mittee which corrolate and im-
prove the vespers programs.

Members include Chaplain Will

President D. Grier Martin, Dean
of Students Richard C. Burts,
Professors Lewis B. Schenck,
Daniel D. Rhodés. and Donald
B. Plott and student represen.

In a Wednesday afternoon
meeting the committee heard the

proposal by several students who
had originally supported the
boycott idea that the required
vespers program be discontin-
ued. :

The group announced that it
hoped to make: some recommen-
dation concerning the situation
to the faculty at its April meet-
ing.

It seemed to be the feeling of
the committee, remarked one
member to THE DAVIDSON-
IAN, that it might be better ‘‘to
abolish vespers altogether rather
than to crucify (the progtam)
through proposals which would
cause a gradual decline jin at-
tendance.”

The proposals to combine the
chapel and vespers cuts were
not. received favorably by the
committee: however, the group
will meet again ‘Monday to con-
sider the other recommenda-
tions.

President Speaks Out
On Vespers Question

By MIKE HARRINGTON
Davidsonian Associate Editor
“If the vespers requirements

which we do have now are done
away with, the results will prob-
ably be that we will have no
real vespers service,” President
D. Grier Martin said to about
250 students Wednesday night at
Open End.

In response to moderator Mur.
ray Smith’s question about the
President's own personal feel-
ings on possible changes in re-
quired vespers services, Martin
stated there were too many fac-
tors and proposals involved for
him to express his opinion.

But he further commented that
there were a great many men
among the faculty, administra-
tion and trustees who were con-
cerned about student feelings on
required vespers services and
who were willing to discuss the
subject with the students.

The threat of a possible stu
dent boycott of vespers services
remained a_ volatile subject.
Martin at first expressed his dis-
tress that some students felt the
administration so deaf to their
objections that they found it nec-
essary io organize boycotts.

Citing the past discussion over
the trunk rule controversy, he
said, ‘1 believe that during the
time of my _ responsibility, a

great deal of action has been
taken on many different matters
due to student interest.”

Firmly declaring his opposi-
tion to any form of student boy-
cott, Martin concluded: “But 1
want to say to you with all the
sincerity that I can, that I do
not believe Davidson College
will be willing to take any ac-
tion as a result of what pressure
might be applied.”

At one point during the ques-
tioning period, Buzz Hardin and
Bob Groat, self-avowed sponsors
of the boycott, declared that. the
planned boycott was a one-shot
affair to express student beliefs,
not to put pressure on the ad-
ministration or anyone else—‘‘to
show that students really care."

Martin gravely thanked them
for their elucidation and said he
nad been misinformed as to the
intent of the boycott. But he sug-
gested there were other more
positive channels of student com-
munication with the administra-
tion, such as petitions and state-
merits of beliefs, that might bet-
ter express student sincerity.

One student engaged the Presi-
dent in a sharp line of question-
ing, as he demanded that Martin
declare the fate of students who
en masse overcut vespers serv-
ices. “The rules will be enforc-
ed ,all of them, for everyone.”
