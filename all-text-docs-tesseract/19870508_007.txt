.adopt it and we go public then.
Probably not a public announce-
ment of the Campaign before
1988, but there is this process of
conversation within the family of
the College before we concede
what has to go on before we do it.
That’s very important.

Obviously the discussion of
the Divestment Policy is some-
thing which has been a continued
concern of the community for a
good long while. I think the prop-
er context for viewing what hap-
pened in the Board-meeting this
time . . . is the fact that in 1979
the Board had acted and espoused
an earlier policy which served as a
kind of a point of reference for the
decisions that were made this go
around.

For me, the policy which has
been adopted is much more
explicit. It provides the adminis-
tration with the kinds of directives
that we need to take the courses of
action that are consistent with the
Trustees reading of what is war-
ranted here. And I think it is safe
to say that the administration of
the College will be more assertive
in the months ahead in terms of
that particular aspect of Invest-
meant Policy (that particular being,
the part having to do with invest-
ment Corporations doing business
in South Africa).

It is not admittedly a policy
which is acceptable or comforta-
ble for all constituencies within
the College. I think it represents to
most within the College evidence
of genuine good will on the part of

the Trustees that take seriously the

concern of the College family in
entering into dialogue and in com-
ing to some sort of reflective con-
clusion which represents their
sensitivity to their own fiduciary
responsibilities as well as to the
moral issues which are involved
and the best way to address those
issues in their judgement.

This is clearly an issue on

|which people of good will and

conscience will not always agree.
I think it leaves open within the
community — it leaves open av-
enues for conversation of other
moral issues as well in terms of the
investment policies of the Col-
lege. And I will ‘say it is com-
pletely within the realm of possi-
bility at some point in the future, I
would not hazard a guess as to
what those issues might be, but I
think it is possible that the Trus-
tees will be asked to apply that
policy in yet other circumstances
than the South African situation as
well. Those are important.
Another . important thing I
would underscore — and this is
something that may have kind of
gotten by in terms of significance,
but the Trustees with considerable
deliberation, made a decision in
terms of the funding for the im-
mediate expenses both for the
Sports Complex and for additional
housing for students to undertake
tax free bond package which is be-
cause of the change in North
Carolina Constitution this last
year is possible for the first time.
This in the judgement of the
Trustees represents in a sense an
exception to the rule. Davidson

| College has a policy of no inde-
btedness, but this particular ap-

proach to funding is one which is

So attractive especially in cases

_ available on campus having to es-

such. as these two. On the one
hand, in the case of the Sports
Complex, in which the funds are

pledged but are going to come in.

over a period of time which is
longer than the construction
period. ‘You know you are going
to have the money, you are just
not going to have it when the
bricks are going into place unless
you choose to wait until all the
money jis in hand. In the other in-
stance, a dormitory is one of those
facilities — one of those few fa-
cilities in a college situation —
which is a revenue producing fa-
cility. And so it will in a sense pay
back its own indebtedness
whether or not funds are raised to
foot the bill on it.

So there is a sense in which by
taking out one of these Tax Free
Bonds and getting the money the
facility itself pays back over the
long puil.-So, I think that’s, a
rather remarkable: step. Not re-
markable in the sense of news
grabbing, but it says that the Trus-
tees have opened the College’s
opportunities for the construction
of new facilities into a new dimen-
sion which was not available to us
before because it was illegal in
North Carolina before, or at least’
‘it-was extra legal, it could be done
legally. And now it’s a possibility
and they have taken advantage of
that possibility and that represents
a lot of significance there too.

Davidsonian: Is the new
housing being built with the no-
tion of eventually providing hous-
ing for all students who desire it
(which isn’t the case now) or is it
being built with an eye toward the

future and making an increase in.

student enrollment?

Kuykendall: The first half of
the question, John —I don’t
think it is economically sensible to
presume housing for 100%. I
don’t think we would ever say, we
have 1,350 beds so we have 1,350
students or vice versa. I think it is
intended to see to it that the stu-
dents who currently desire off
campus housing and are not able
to afford it, obtain it not afford it,
are able to obtain it will have the
option for some on campus situa-
tion. But we will not, according to
my reckoning of the numbers, will
not be up to 1,350 beds on campu
at any point. ;

We will always depend upon
the outside community, both for
those students who need for finan-
cial reasons to live at home or to
live in some other circumstances
and for those students who simply
desire to be in another setting, we
probably are going to find ourse-
Ives (this is pendulum of student
inclination in terms goes back and
forth) we are probably going to
find ourselves at some points
along that swinging of the pen-
dulum saying to some people we
know’ you don’t want to live on
campus, but you've got to live on
campus because we figure our
budget this way. And that’s going
to be mildly coercive in it s way as
it has been maybe mildly or more
than mildly, coercive to . some
$ophomore males the last few
years saying, “Sorry guys, we've
haven’t got any rooms. You've
got to-go find your own colony. So
we'll probably find ourselves as
we exparid the number of beds

tablish some basic guidelines as to
, who can live off campus and
under what circumstances. So it
becomes then a privilege rather
than a necessity once again.

With regard to growth, the
current policy of the College is
that we intend to stay essentially
the same size. Now I say the pol-
icy as though it were singular, it’s
really multi-form. One policy of
the College is that we do not con-
struct any general facility for the
College without assuming a stu-

dent body population of 1,500. So”

Little Library is built on that basis,
the Commons is built on that
basis, the new Sport Complex is
built on that basis.

The other side of that is that
we need to be realistic about the
demographic situation that we
face over the next six to seven
years and we are far more con-

_ cerned to maintain the quality of
the student body that we currently
have than we are to increase the
size of the student body. And I
‘think probably by the mid-1990’s
we are going to see ourselves in
the situation in which the addition
of say 10 students a year, what-
ever, is increasingly difficult to do
at the same time that you maintain
‘the quality of the students that you
have attracted to the community.
So I think there are going to be a
lot of factors to play into that.

If I had to guess, I would say
that the growth will be very
gradual in the next decade. It may
go up 50 or so, but that’s specula-
tion on my part. And it will take
some. careful planning on our part,
because you don’t increase the
student body without enhancing a
lot of other things here as well and
you have to plan for those in ad-
vance. It would be in my judge-
ment, folly, to bring in 100 addi-
tional students and not enhance
. the faculty say by 10 positions and
that’s a lot of money to do that and
we would be doing everybody
more of a disservice if we didn’t
do it. So I think these things have
to more concurrently, and it’s far
more prudent to do that gradually
than it is to leap in and do it all at
once. So I think we will be just
watching that on a year to year
basis without much sense that
there will be radical in any given
time.

Davidsonian: Last Tuesday,
the faculty approved a change to
the semester system by a vote of
56-50. Is this majority enough to
begin implementation of a semes-
ter system at Davidson?

Kuykendall: I think it is. Yes,
I think we have no choice because
a simple majority is all that is re-
quired. I would hope that in the
weeks and months ahead, those
who have particular difficulties in
certain parts of this could be
brought to a more positive orienta-
tion. And I think from the nature
of the debate and from the issues
that were raised in last Tuesday’s
meeting, my sense of the whole is,
that though there are some strong
preferences, there is no over-
whelming reluctance on the part
of most of those who may have
voted no to give us a try.

I think 56 to 50 in this instance
Says someting about the tradi-
tional caution with which the

- Davidson faculty approaches cur-

ricular. change and _ calendar
change. And of course, there were
a lot of issues involved in this one
package as it came forward. There
may have beén those who very
much think that the sorts of
change indicated in the cur-
riculum are entirely warranted and
didn’t like the calendar” There
may have been others who liked
the calendar and thought that in
the curricular area something had
been left to size. So, it’s a very
complicated thing to carry a pack--
age like that to a faculty and dis-
cover any kind of consensus.

And I have the feeling that the
further we go the more the
momentum will be to get on with
the changes and discover the ways
in which it can be made. I’m con-
fident that the Dean and others
will be working closely with de-
partments that may have particu-
lar problems that need resolution,
to see to it that those problems can
be resolved in the best possible
fashion. And I don’t think -we
Ought to minimize the fact that in
some areas of the College’s life
the changes are going to be more
radical than in others, and we need
to honor that in terms of the transi-
tional period and the time given to
specific departments to work on
what needs to be accomplished in
the interim.

Davidsonian: Recently there
was a student survey taken in
which students expressed a
number of opinions. One of those
was on the change to semesters.
The percentages were fairly eve-
nly divided between those who
wanted semesters, those who
wanted to stay on the present term
system, and those who were unde-
cided. Do you think that the
change to semesters should reflect
student opinion?

Kuykendall: Well, I would
hope that everthing that happens
at the college reflects student
opinion to some degree. I think,
truth to tell, matters of curriculum
and calendar are faculty preroga-
tives though. I think that in this in-
stance as in others we ought to be
attentive to what students have to
say. I’m not sure that that always
says we do precisely what that
constituency of the college family
wants. I think its probably more
important in terms of the long
term future of the college that the
faculty be convinced that this is
the best way to do the educational
mission which we have set for
ourselves.

‘I had good and interesting
conversations with students who
have taken the calendar piece of
this package as the most signifi-
cant. I happen not to believe that’s
so, and I have not been able in my
own thinking about this to accord
the same level of seriousness to
the debate of terms vs. semesters
that I have of the sorts of academic
enhancements that are involved in
this proposal which has been
made. And I will be ready to grant
that may be a failure on my part.

‘I came to Davidson without
any clear perceptions that there
were moral issues involved in the
debate between the semester and
the term and discovered pretty
early after my arrival that in the
minds of some at least that there
are and I don’t want to disparage
their perception. But I think that in.

tion goes on at the level of convi-
ence and it’s sometimes not possi-
ble simply to talk at that level.

I think that there are good
thinks to be said for both systems.
I taught for 11 years under a sys-
tem which is essentially a term

many instances that the conversa- | -

system and I found it a viable way
to do education. I went to school
most of the time under the semes-
ter system and except for the fact
that the semester system. under
which I was educated always had
that desperate two weeks right
after Christmas before exams,
which is not a part of the system
that is proposed, I always thought
the semester system was O.K.
too. I had a friend in one of my
educational experiences who was

pleading for what we called the | .

quarter system at that time, on the
basis that its easier to make a first

down than a touchdown and I’m | -

not sure that that holds water.

But I think both calendar sys-
tems are viable ways of doing edu-
cation and sometimes a change is
warrented because of educational
concerns that would shuffle things

around a bit. I think the majority |:

of the faculty feels it is that time at
Davidson. Before I came. to
Davidson I also read the debates in
the minutes of the faculty which I
think occurred a year before I
came. I was interested in seeing
some of the dimensions of the de-

bate at that fime which had been of

course brought up once again this
time.

Davidsonian: Will there be a
supervisory committee to oversee
the implementation oa,

Kuykendall: I’m sire there
will be. I’m not sure this
juncture the educational policy
committee will probably have the
responsibility for articulating the

way that we go. And we will have |:

to confront the issue as to whether
or not we can get started and get
on with it in the course of next
year and have it in place. I’m sure
that that’s the intention of the
committee. Essentially we’ve got
a lot of time and in another sense
we haven't got much time. We’ve
got 15 months to see it to fruition
and we've got a lot to do in that
period of time.

Davidsonian: Is there any
particular president you espe-
cially admire?

Kuykendall: I admire my im-
mediate predecessors whom I
knew. I admire Dr. Spencer
whom I’ve never worked with in
this college, but I admire him for
what he did for this college in his
years of presidency. President
Martin gave me my first job, and
he may have been wrong to do it,
but he was and is a man who is a
special hero of mine because of
the human qualities but also obvi-
ously because of his great accom-
plishments.

His predecessor, Dr. Cunnin-
gham, I knew only slightly as a
freshman and a sophomore. There
was no person as distinguished
and overwhelming as he was as an
individual; he was called “Slick
John,” and he had plenty of hair.
He was the epitome of the gentle-
man, the well-educated, urbane,
sophisticated, highly committed
leader that ‘was typioal of college
presidents fifty years ago.
