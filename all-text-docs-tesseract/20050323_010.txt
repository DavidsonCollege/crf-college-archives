Basketball team loses scholarships

The College announced late today
that men’s basketball scholarships will
be cut at the end of the year because of a
lack of visible progress towards a
national powerhouse team.

Among the noted
missed goals were
the failures to beat
Duke and to make
the NCAA tourna-
ment.

Davidson College
president Frank
Baum spoke of the
disappointment in
not reaching the
NCAA tournament.
“We figured before
the season that, at
the very least, we
would be an eighth

seed in the tourna- Unfortunately, the NIT just doesn’t cut it.

ment. But, to not

even make the tour-

nament this year was painful for all of
us. Finally, I sat down with the athletic
director and we made the difficult deci-
sion to cut scholarships.”

A pattern had been noticed in the
alumni donations to the athletic pro-
gram before the NCAA selection and
afterwards.

Because of the excitement that the
men’s basketball season*had generated,
alumni donations to the program had

A Jiff of Jeff...

gone up 130 percent in the last year.
After discovering that Davidson was not
going to be in the NCAA tournament,
donations to the athletic department
have dropped to zero.

Men’s
basketball
coach Ty
Rogers dis-
cussed the
prospect of
the season
without
scholar-
ships: “J
understand
it will be
tougher to
get recruits
here now
without the
lure of
scholar-

ships. but I”

am confident in my team’s ability to
overcome adversity and make the NCAA
tournament next year.”

When asked about the prospect of
playing next year without a scholarship,
star forward John Waters ’06 stated,
“Yeah right, man. I can’t pay $40,000 to
go here. I guess I will be transferring
somewhere else.”

Point guard Bobby Stuart ’07 spoke
along the same lines. “I don’t think any-

one is going to stay here if they’re not
getting paid to play. At least, I’m not.
I’ve already filled out the paperwork.” -

“It will be
tough when we
play scholarship

schools like
Wofford, but I’m
sure we will get

through it.”

While the prospects for next season
look bleak, Davidson basketball still has
at least one fan.

Stephanie Young ’07, head of the
Davidson Cat Pack, spoke about sup-
porting the team.

“I’m still going to be the crazy red-
faced fanatic that cheered the team
when they had scholarships. It will be
tough when we play scholarship schools
like Wofford and Furman, but I’m sure
we will get through it.” ,

Wright’s highly popular “Wright for
You” campaign was forced to switch
directions when Martin’s ‘Wrong for Us’

“It’s a good day
for Hank Martin,
a good day for
Davidson, and a
good day for
democracy.”

flyers spread all over campus, thus
sending the campaign into a tailspin of
negative advertising.

“J thought that it was extremely inap-
propriate for Mr. Martin to attack
Stephen in. such a manner,” said
Wright’s campaign manager, Lyle Duff
’06, about his rival’s mudslinging tac-
tics. “There is no reason to stoop to that
level, even in such a high profile race as
this one.”

The two sides traded barbs for the
next four days as campus was littered
with flyers from “Hank Martin is Sub-
Free,” to “Stephen Wright is unfaithful
to his girlfriend.” Finally, the posters
culminated in Martin putting up a
poster saying “Stephen Wright only got
into this school because he’s an athlete,”
and Wright responding with an
“Everybody knows that athletes don’t
get help with admissions at Davidson”
poster.

Dean of Elections Wesley Young, said
that the election was the most intense
that he had ever seen at Davidson.

“T’ve been running elections for over
40 years at Davidson, and I’ve never
seen it like this. Of course, there was
always the occasional ‘He’s a drunk,’ or
‘He’s a carpetbagger,’ but what these
young men were saying had some
teeth.”

Election observer Dr. Lee Insel
agreed that the election was extremely
hard-fought.

“These partisan politics need to end,
especially during trying times such as
these. With the school already overcom-
mitted to renovations of the F apart-
ment and Duke Dormitory at the same
time and carrying huge budget deficits,
the infighting will severely hurt us both
economically and in relations with other
colleges.”

As the election neared, cries of over-
spending from the Martin camp got
louder.

One of Martin’s staffers, Jane Leigh
08, said what Wright was doing was
obvious. “You're telling me that you’re
spending less than $15 and printing fly-
ers on the kind of extremely high quali-
ty thick stock paper that they were
using? I’m a trusting person, but I’m
not stupid.”

Wright has never confirmed or
denied the allegations, but the look on
his face at his concession speech indi-
cated remorse. “We never wanted to
hurt anyone,” Wright said tearfully. “We
just wanted extended meal plan hours.”

According to the most recent polls,
Hank Martin is now the clear favorite to
win a seat in the SGA senate and is
expected to gain enough votes to carry
the title of president.

Upon hearing that Wright was drop-
ping out of the race, Martin said, “It’s a
good day for Hank Martin, a good day
for Davidson, and a good day for democ-
racy.”

The Davidsonian

actually on
automatic

After Friday’s electrical surge, it was
discovered that the piano on the third
floor of the Alvarez Student Union is
actually an automatic “player piano.”

Said witness Peter Lyle ’07, “I was in
the Union at about 10 p.m. on Friday,
when all the lights went out for a brief
moment. When they turned back on,
there was a loud beeping noise, and the
piano just started playing by itself.”

He continued, “I then saw the Union
desk worker run over to the piano and
flip some switch underneath it, after
which it stopped played.”

_ When reached for comment, Union
Supervisor Jack Lux stated, “At this
time, we admit that yes, the piano is
automatic. We apologize for any percep-

“We got a great
deal on it,
because it only
plays five songs,
all of them poorly
and out of tune.”

tion of deceit, and we do admit that in
hindsight, we should have told the stu-
dent body, especially those who actually
believed that they were playing the
piano. But, we got a great deal on it,
because it only plays five songs, all of
them poorly and out of tune.”

Campus reactions were mixed.
Remarked Jess Wilder ’05, “I just think
it’s strange that people would sit down
and pretend to play the piano. I still
don’t know why they would want to be
seen pretending to be playing some ter-
rible song and annoying everyone in the
Union.”

Phil Lazarus ’07- echoed her state-
ments. “I was always wondering why
there would only be four or five songs
ever played. Now it all makes sense. I
just wonder if the Karaoke in the Union
was lip synching as well. There goes all
my trust in the school.”

According to the administration,
there are no plans to change the piano
or upgrade it to a better model.
