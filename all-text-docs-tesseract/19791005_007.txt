Little Library housed secret treasure

Literary detective Nelson tracks works of Thoreau

By NANCY MCNAIR

When English professor
Randy Nelson first came to
Davidson for interviews, he
neglected the library on three
separate occasions. Not until
teaching his first English 104
class did he make his astonish-
ing discovery in the E.H. Little
Library stacks.

“You'd have thought he’d
been shot out of a cannon
running down those:stairs with:
that book,’’ remembers Library
Director Leland Park. The
cause of all this excitement: a
scarce edition of Henry David
Thoreau‘s works, a page written
in Thoreau‘s now-fading hand
bound into the cover to ensure
its rarity.

Apparently, the wisest thing
about Thoreau’s sister Sophia
was her name. Instead of seeing
that her dead brother's work be
published, she released a trunk
full of principally unpublished
material for use in a promotion-
al scheme.

According to Nelson, the
publishers, Houghton, Mifflin,
and Company, used a practice
known as ‘“‘tipping”’ to enhance
the sales of their 1906 collec-
tion, The Writings of Henry
David Thoreau. This involves

binding a page of the original
manuscript in the first volume
of each'set. Thus, 600 copies of
the “manuscript” edition and
200 copies of the ‘‘Walden”’
edition have carried with them a
total of 800 pages of unpub-
lished Thoreau writings.

Nelson’s job as editor of the
tentatively titled Nature Es-
says and Literary Remains is to
round up these tipped pages
and place them in sequence for
Thoreau scholars. In 1973 Nel-
son began proofreading and
manuscript work as a Princeton
graduate student. Upon gradu-
ation came his appointment as
editor on the Thoreau project.
From Princeton and now David-
son, he has sent between 7500
and 9000 letters, canvassing
libraries for copies of the 1906
edition.

So far, the results of his work
have been encouraging. “‘Of 800
pages, we now have around 500,
enough to begin making deduc-
tions,’’ said Nelson. ‘‘The best
sourcé seems to be Presbyterian
preachers’ widows, little old
ladies in North Dakota or
somewhere who write that their
husbands loved to read,’’ he
added. However, Nelson has his
problems with rare book dealers
who wish to preserve the rarity
of their merchandise by refusing
publication.

Ironically, Nelsofi never sent
a letter to Davidson College,
shrugging off his near-home-
town school. One day, however,

. he went to the stacks to look for

the Standard Thoreau edition
for a class. Nelson leapt at the
sight of the 1906 edition on the
shelf. ‘But don't worry, it was
safe,’’ he noted. ‘‘The book
hadn‘t been checked out since
about 1952.'’Director Park im-
mediately sprinted the book to
the rare book room where it now
rests in the atitograph section.
“It's a little unnerving to think
that something like that is up
there,”’ declared Park.

The fragment of manuscript
bound in the Davidson copy,
numbered 364 of 600, reveals a
tentative hand in brown ink on
faintly blue-lined paper. The
editor must become a grapoho-
logist of sorts, deciding whether
the pencil-corrections are ori-
ginal to the author. Nelson
notes of Thoreau‘s handwriting
that ‘‘...by 1861, Thoreau is
dying and he knows it. His
writing becomes’ chicken
scratch.’’ He dates the David-
son page in the 1850's and

identifies the pencil as Tho-
reau’s own hand.

Although Thoreau never tit-
led the essay containing the
Davidson page, Nelson and his
colleagues tentatively, call it

October 5, 1979—The Davidsonian—7

Professor Randy Nelson examines the scarce ce Henry David Thirson

edition that he found in the E.H. Little Library.

‘‘Nature and Moonlight.”’ In
sparse prose, Thoreau describes
the meticulous work of the
stone-cutter: ;

His work is slow and
expensive. Nature is here
hard to be overcome. He
must sharpen his tools
oftener than the carpenter.
He fights with granite. He
knows the temper of the
rock. He grows strong
himself; his tread is pon-
derous and steady like the
fall of a rock.

Nelson states that ‘‘under
severe and heated attacks” at
professional meetings, he. has
argued that these unpublished
works would haye been a sequel
to Walden. He hopes to have
the edition ready for a two
volume publication by the Prin-
ceton University Press in the
1980's.

Library Director Park often
has the experience of professors

coming by and saying, ‘“‘would
you believe that the Davidson
Library has..." “And most of
the time, we bought the book
when it first came out,’’ he
added. Park credits this wealth
or first-editions material to the
wise selection by Davidson
professors over the year. ““And
I expect that someone like Dr.
Nelson will come through and
find more treasures in our li-
brary.”

Take a few moments and visit
the rare book room. (Wear a
sweater; it is a bit cool in there.)
Feel the deckle-edged pages of
the seventy-three year old vol-
ume. Study the daguerreotype
of Henry David Thoreau on the
frontspiece with his half-moon
fringe of beard. and drooping
brow. Read Thoreau in Tho-
reau’s own hand. Check your
attic and your grandmother’s
for the 1906 edition. And let
Randy Nelson tell you the
proper way to pronounce ‘‘Tho-
reau.””

Alumni converge here for

Homecoming Weekend

By ELIZABETH WILSON
Staff Correspondent

The administration is prepa-
ring for a large-scale invasion
this weekend. A battalion of
over 400 veterans are en route
at this very moment, planning
to bombard the campus ‘in
staggered attacks beginning
Friday afternoon. We consi-

dered sending out the Nation-

al Guard, but Zack Long and
the folks at the alumni office
had a better idea: they sche-
duled so many barbecues,

tours, receptions, and picnics

that the invaders won't have

the time or. the, energy to do .

much damage.

Pretty good idea, huh? Well,
the returning alumnis think so
too, and they plan to enjoy this
Homecoming Weekend even

more than us students(if that’s
humanly possible).

The foray begins with an
Alumni/Varsity Baseball game
Friday afternoon, followed by a
Barbecue and Brew for the class
of 1974 at Dean Terry’s. Satur-
day will include a blitzkrieg of
meetings, tours, receptions,
reunions(focusing on the classes
of 1909, 1914, 1919, 1974, 1977,
1978, and 1979), culminating in
a Homecoming Luncheon and,
of course, the football game.

So if you. notice a few
suspicious-looking characters
lurking about the campus this
weekend, don’t calkSecurity.

“Use the official counterattack

strategy; march right up and

say hello. You probably won’t

be bayonetted and you may
even learn something.
