Riflers hit upon money plan

By EBENEEZER CHOKE
Staff Writer

In attempts to raise funds
for the purchase of badly
needed equipment, the David-
son College Rifle Team has
toyed with several schemes,
the latest of these and the one
which seems to hold the most
promise for success is the
proposal to hire out team
members as ‘‘Hit Men’’, or
more correctly, now that the
team has gone coed, ‘‘Hit
Persons’’,

First suggested last spring,
the idea met enthusiastic re-
sponse from the varsity shoot-
ers.

Coach Capt. Jerry Flan-
nigan feels that the proposal
will be beneficial to the team
for two reasons. ‘‘Not only will
this be an important source of
income but it will allow oppor-
tunity for my shooters to get
in some valuable practice dur-
ing hours when the range may
not be open,”’ he;said.

Discussions with College
President Dr. Samuel R.
Spencer Jr. added weight to
the team’s decision. In a
recent interview Dr. Spencer
praised the rifle team for their
ingenuity and commented,
‘‘Having our very own Hit
Men here at Davidson will be a
great step forward for this
institution. This will help to
give Davidson some badly
needed publicity, and put us
back on the map.”’

Cartmill feels that this move
will cause a major shift of
emphasis in Davidson athle-
tics. ‘‘I see the rifle team
moving up; I see them moving
to fill the void left by the poor
performance of our football
and basketball teams in recent
years:”’

For the past three weeks
team members Katherine
Whitney and Rob Mitchell
have been conducting a pre-
liminary feasibility study of
the Davidson campus.
“Things should work out just
fine, from the bell tower of
DCPC, the top of the dome,
the library roof and assorted
Belk windows we can just
about cover the entire campus.
I’m looking forward to a great
season,’’ said team captain
Tom Miller, basing his com-
ments on the study.

When word of the team’s
intentions leaked out recently
the response was encouraging.
Already 16 freshmen have
made inquiries.

Faculty feelings were aiteed
on the issue, however. A letter
expressing great concern was
received Wednesday signed by
the seven members of the first
year Humanities staff.

‘ On the other hand, Profes-
sor Rogerson of the Spanish
department seemed rather ela-
ted over the whole thing, as he
hurried down to the rifle range
to discuss the possibility of
group rates for a contract on
his entire two séctions of
Spanish I students.

‘‘As.a member of David-
son’s rifle team I feel that this
experience will be a rewarding
one for (most) of those con-
cerned. I feel that it will help
to increase team spirit as it
creates an air of competition
among those shooters vying
for contracts,’’ said team
member Tom Niblock.

“The-added income will be (=

especially useful. Having only
seven weapons severely limits
the team’s ability to perform
at their optimum, he con-
tinued.

“The money we earn
through our hard work will be
used to purchase new weapons
and scopes. This will enable us
to expand our operations and
bring more freshmen into the
program,’’ said Flannigan.

This is the dawn of a new
era in Davidson's history. You
can be part of that history:
support the rifle team. You
can’t afford not to!

Athletic Director Thomas
Cartmill announced today the
football team’s acquisition of a
number of items from the rest
of.the athletic department.

“Tom (Couch) and I figured
that the only way we were
going to get a winning football
team here would be to get the
combined effort of the entire
athletic department behind
the grid program,” said Cart-
mill. ‘‘Since most of them
didn’t want to comply, we just
used a little persuasion and
confiscated all this stuff.”

Taken first were the bud-
gets for all other sports—in-
tercollegiate, club, and IMAC.
‘‘We left ’em a little bit for
said
Cartmill, ‘“‘but we got all the
real loot for our kitty. In a few
years if we start to win big
we'll let ’em have a few funds,
but right now they can get by
with playing all home games,
playing in street clothes,
whatever. We may loan ’em a

few jocks.”’

“These durn goals, they make
the best towel baskets you
ever did see,’’ he noted. ‘‘And
this field, why, we’re going to
use this one for left-handed
pulling guards with even-
numbered jerseys to train on,
if I remember correctly.”

When asked about his new
golf cart, Couch quipped,
‘‘Ain’t she a beaut? It’ll do 35
without. even trying, and it’ll
pull like a mine mule. Of
course, we had to sell the track
team into slavery to buy it,
but believe me it’s worth every
cent.”’

Other acquisitions are num-
erous. The track locker room
will be used to store the
football team’s socks. “‘Some
A-rab sold us a whole truck-
load of siightly irregular
socks,’’ said Couch, ‘‘and we
are going to need a whole lot of
space for them. You know
how important they are to a
winning program.”

Also taken was¢he Univer-
sal weight machine, which will
be placed behind the East
stands and used for hanging
out wet uniforms to dry. When
asked if the machine will be
accessible for use, Cartmill
said, ‘‘Heck no!

Couch noted that the swim-
ming pool was one of the first
items to go. ‘‘We got a special
deal on an outboard motor
from the Evinrude place, so
we're going to bolt it down at
the deep end of the pool and
make the state’s biggest

’ whirlpool out of it. We hear

that Williams College has one
almost as large, but what the
heck,” he chortled.

During the interview, this
reporter noticed a large num-
ber of footballs, each with
“IMAC*“ written on it in large
print, in the corner of Cart-
mill’s office. He said this
concerning¢the balls: ‘‘Oh,
yeah! Well, we figured if we
could get our players more
accustomed to handling the
ball then we’d have a lot fewer
fumbles, so we took all of
these from Jeff and are going
to give all our backs and ends
one each to sleep with. We
hope there’ll be no emotional
involvement,’’ he added.

When asked about the large
number of workmen applying
their trades in the gym, Cart-
mill said, ‘‘We’re going to turn
that outdated, drafty gym
into tHe finest facility for
entertaining recruits in all of
college football. We’re going
to have three floors of plush
suites, a movie theater, a bar,
and who knows what else. It’ll
be fully staffed, air-condit-
ioned, just like your best New
York hotels. No way we can
lose in recruiting with that
baby.’ Plans for buying a
Lear jet for recruiting have not
been finalized.
