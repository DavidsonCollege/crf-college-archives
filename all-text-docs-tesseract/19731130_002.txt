Sead Jum Goodice chairman
of the Energ, Conservation
Committee

Goodioe emphasized that
Students aren't the only ones
affected by the energy crisis.
but that everyone on campus
will share the discomforts of
the fuel reductions

Director of the Physical
Plant Grover C Meetze poin-
ted out that the termperature
in all buildings is being
reduced to 68 degrees and that
there will be attempts to
reduce some hall lighting and
turn off some incandescent
lights

“We are trying to develop
the best solutions to the
Situation For instance. you
can get heat from the lighting.
SO we May not want to turn off
some lights. Also there will
be no cut down on outside
security lights.’ said Meetze.

With the present cutbacks. it
is hoped that Davidson will be
able to purchase the oil
necessary for meeting. the
college's fuel demands.

One problem faced by the
college is that under the oil
allocation system Davidson
can only buy as much oil as it
purchased last vear

Last year. the college
utilized quite a bit of natural
gas as an energy source. Since
gas supplies have been in-
terrupted until April 15. the
college is completely depen-
dent on oil

“We want to let everyone
know what is happening so
that they will be conscious of
conserving energy in all ac-
tivities.’ said Goodloe.

An energy conservation
committee has been formed
by Goodloe to give students
the opportunity to work with
Meetze and the Physical Plant
Department in developing
methods by which energy can
be saved.

The present measures are
aimed at reducing the fuel ex-

pended in producing steam

heat. Contrary to early re-
ports. hot water will still be
available in the dorms
throughout the day.

Unless the energy crisis
becomes more severe, there
are no other major fuel cut-
backs anticipated. Students
are asked to use as little elec-
tricity as possible, but no
regulation of usage is con-
templated at this time.

It is possible that in the
future certain campus
buildings will be closed for the
night in order to conserve

energy. but no concrete plans
have yet been formulated

“The action is to be com-
mended and is reasonable. We
must get used to living with
less of the comforts of life

“I think it is a policy we
should continue next year as
well and in the vears to
follow,” said Steve Smith in
reaction to the fuel shortage
measures

“It is just going to be a little
colder." siad Meetze

Random House Closes

Due To Funding Lack

The number of houses left on
the Patterson Court dropped
to eight when the Student Life
Committee voted to discon-
tinue the lease held by the
members of Random House.

The reasons for closing were
both a lack of sufficient finan-
ces and a failure to meet the 20
percent non-off campus. non-
national membership
representation in the house.
according to Council of Social
Organizations President Mitch

vis.

The membership of Random
House was dominated by
members of the Sigma Phi Ep-
silon fraternity, having 19 out
of a total of 25 members.

The number was “not
enough to keep us financially
solvent,”’ stated Random
House treasurer Ken
Williams.

Former Random House af-
filiate and present Sig Ep
president’ Duncan Baker,
although admitting that the
closing of the on-campus
eating house might discourage
some freshmen Sig Ep
pledges, didn't think that the
move would directly hurt the
national SPE fraternity,
whose off-campus activities
are strictly social

“Out of 44 brothers, not
more than 18 wanted to eat
here anyway.” Baker pointed
out, ‘‘and for those of us that
were, each member of Ran-
dom House would have had to
pay $220 apeice in order to
keep the house open,’ Baker
said.

“We'll stay closed Winter
term,” confessed Baker. ‘‘but
Will Terry is trying to help us
reopen in the Spring if there is
a renewed interest.”

Indeed, the main point that
was continually being em-
Phasized by all persons in-
volved was the mistaken
association of Random House
with the Sig Ep’s

“My reaction is that the two
should not be confused with
each other,” Purvis declared.
“nor should the closing be
taken as a retaliation against
the Sig Ep fraternity itself.”

“I do, however, think that
some controls had to be
necessary to keep the Sig Ep's
from having both on and off-
campus houses,’ Purvis con-
cluded

Meanwhile, the displaced
Members are either trying to
eat in houses elsewhere on the

court, at the ARA houses. or in
their roots “es
