Brighton Beach Memoirs

By MICHELE MILLER
On April 24, 25, 30, and May
1, 2, the theatre department brings
to us Neil Simon’s Brighton
Beach Memoirs, an autobiog-
raphical comedy about a young
writer going through the rites of
passage.
_ Brighton Beach Memoirs is
the story of Eugene Jerome, a
budding writer growing up in a

- Jewish family. The play is set in

1937 in a depressed neighborhood
of New York. Eugene, the young
Neil Simon character, lives with
his parents, his aunt, his brother,

and two female cousins. The fam- —

ily barely scrapes by in their
crowded flat. Eugene writes as a
a

defense against claus-
trophobia.

“You can look at it as a young
boy’s rite of passage and as a fam-
ily’s struggle for survival,” says
visiting director Connie Welsh,

istic director of Charlotte’s Tar-
radiddle Players. For Welsh, the
phrase “a family tree grows in
Brighton Beach” sums up what
she hopes to convey. “This is a
family who really has to survive
and the only way they had to sur-
vive was by depending on each
other and relating to each other,”
says Welsh. She concentrates on
the family’s need for each other,
their problems and their relation-
ships.

Theater department presents

Neil Simon is striving in
Brighton Beach Memoirs toward
refinement and maturity in his
writing, says Welsh. “Neil Simon
is the most popular playwright
that has ever lived. His plays are
produced more than any other
writer, probably even Shakes-
peare. I think he is so popular be-
cause he catches the pulse of the
present time and he twists it with a
little bit-of humor. He’s fun and
he’s human and people enjoy
him,” says Welsh. “Simon is very
clever; he is a superb craftsman.
He knows where the laughs are
coming and knows where to build

Dr-Gardner offers new perspective on U'S‘S:R-

By AARON LEVINE

‘Davidson's lecture circuit has
been dominated this year by ex-
perts discussing the Soviet Union;
it is refreshing to hear an ordinary
tourist speak on the topic for a
change. Wednesday in the 900
Room, as part of the Union’s
Open Luncheon series, Davidson

traveled to the U.S.S.R. in Janu-

ary; his lecture was co-sponsored .

by the Dean Rusk program.

He was especially interested
in the Soviet theater. In visiting
the Kirov Ballet, he noted that
while the artistry was just as good
as that of any Western ballet com-
pany, the technical qualities of the
night’s production were not up to
Western standards. Gardner esti-
mated that the Soviets are approx-
imately 30 years behind the
United States when it comes to the
technical aspects of staging.

The Kirov was not the only
ballet ‘Gardner attended while in
Russia. Near the end of his jour-
ney, while in Moscow, he at-

world-renowned Bolshoi Ballet

Grigorievich,

Gardner remarked. that the
performances were “excellent.”
He was able to attend a small party
given in honor of Grigorievich.
Gardner remarked that it was

paradoxical that what he witnes-’.

sed at the party was the “pinnacle”
of the class system that purports to
be classless.

Some of the lecture was spent
on reflection on the lives of other
types of artists also living in the
Soviet Union. How does a writer
function in a society such as this?

Gardner, he needs aname, and the ©

One person Gardner met, a

once “demoted” from a previous
job because she had received “too
much information from abroad.”

“An artist needs to be careful

Gardner suggested that this might
represent only the desire to be pro-
tective with guests, rather than a
desire to keep Americans and
other foreigners away. The people
were friendly, he said.
