Each _ every David-
son stu Fay without
—_ a $100.00 general

Where does this money
go?

Mr. R. A. Currie, Busi-
ness Manager of the Col-
lege, summarized the pur-

se of the single fee as fol-
ows: “Prior to 1956, stu-
dents paid various fees to-
ward the costs of student
activities, health and physi-
cal education, laboratory
courses, the College Union,
the library, etc.

“Because of the extensive
bookkeeping involved ahd
other factors, this system
was changed and $100.00
general fee per year was
charged. This single pay-

ment finances student ac-
tivities and contributes to
the operating requirements
of the College.”

“Up to $21.75 of this can
be used for student activi-
ties; the remainder of the
general fee along with in-
come from tuition, from en-
dowment and annual gifts
to the College is used to
meet operating require-
ments of the College.”

Exactly what will the
student get for his $100
this year?

The $21.75 student ac-
tivities fee purchases all
lication issues of the
AVIDSONIAN, SCRIPS
and PRANKS, and QUIPS

io CRANKS and admis- backed by endowment dol-

and performances of the
Red pont Black Masquers.
This fee covers the ope-
rating expense of the stu-
dent government and the
cost of forensic teams,
when they are active.

Secondly, the. student
contributes $78.25 or more
to the maintenance and
operating expense of the
College. Before 1956. the
student paid numerous fees
covered by this category—
laboratory, student health,

library, gymnasium, student ACTIVITIES BUDGET

down into components. The
student activity fee is, how-
ever, divided each year and
allocated to the various or-

ganizations which it sup-
ports.
“Article XVIII of the

Constitution of the Student
Government of Davidson
College,” stated Mr. Currie,
“designates a Financial
Committee which. has . the
annual duty of allocating
the total student activities
fees available. The Commit-
tee is composed of the Bus-
iness Manager of the Col-
lege, two members of the
faculty, the Secretary of
the Student Body, and two
senior members of the Stu-

dent Council.”

“At the beginning of
each school year, student
organizations submit to
the Committee requests
for funds with detailed
estimated budgets. Allo-
cations are made on this
basis. Any unspent funds
at the end of a year re-
main in trust and may be
used for student activities
in the following year.”

This year's allocations to-
tal. $18,216 for the follow-
ing six student activities:
Quips and Cranks—$7500;
DAVIDSONIAN — $4700:
Scripts and Pranks—$2050;
Artist Series — $4300; stu-
dent government — $216;

ge Elaborates On Activitie$ Fee

Red and Black Masquers —
$450. No budget was sub-
mitted this year for forens-
ic. The Red and Black Mas-
quers were appropriated
funds in case interest crys-
tallized among the stu-
dents, enabling plays to be
presented this year as in
the past.

The total income. from
this year’s general fee can-
not be determined now be-
cause refunds will be made
to students withdrawing
during the first 10 weeks

of this semester and be-
cause the enrollment for
second semester is un-

known. The general fee in
1958-59 amounted to ap-
proximately $88,600.

Vance Packard is interest-

He talked enthusiastically
with students, frequently tak-
ing notes on what they were
saying.

He laughed at examples of
status seeking advertisements
presented to him and made
copies of some of them.

He visited the DAVIDSON-
IAN office late in to the eve-
ning after his talk Wednesday,
chatting with staff members
and answering their questions
about newspaper work.

Vance Packard was
pressed with Davidson.

He liked the students and the
physical aspects of the college
plant.

He said that considered “The

Vance Packard is a man
vitally interested in the
American society. He doesn’t
claim to be a sociologist
spouting dogma, iust a re-
porter presenting the facts.
However, he has done a good
amount of independent re-
search.

“Sociologists feel that I have |
given the public an Insight in-|

to the social structure in which!
they exist. None have ever ob-
jected to my use of their
works.”

“People who have. read my

in terms of striving for status!

and how that striving has pro-
