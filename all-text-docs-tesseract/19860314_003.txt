Asian news — In the Philippines, a
spokesman for newly elected President
Corazon Aquino said that she may pro-

officials appointed by her deposed pre-
decessor Ferdinand Marcos; several
former Marcos officials have already
been arrested. There is a rumor that Mar-
cos, who is in exile in Hawaii, will at-
tempt to regroup his political allies.

Meanwhile, documents were found
in the Filipino Presidential Palace reveal-
ing that Imelda Marcos, the wife of Fer-
dinand Marcos, held bank accounts
under fictitious names in order to funnel
money out of the Philippines to finance
expensive shopping trips in the U.S. and
Europe.

Earlier this week thousands rallied in
Seoul, South Korea demanding direct
presidential elections and democratic re-
form in the country.

Other International News —
Reagan conceded that he will be “willing

to see what someone offers” if the House
votes down his request for $100 million
in aid for the Nicaraguan rebels; how-
ever, to date no proposed alternatives
have proved satisfactory and Reagan re-
mains committed to his original request.

Meanwhile, Marlo Suario, former
Socialist Prime Minister of Portugal, was
sworn in Sunday as the country’s first
elected civilian president in 60 years.

In other. international develop-

Pictures from the Soviet space craft
“Vega 2” confirm that as opposed to the
two-core theory deduced from earlier

$354 million in missiles. Last Friday the
State Department told the U.S.S.R. to re-
duce the size of its U.N. mission in New
York by 40 percent during the next two
years; the Soviets are protesting this “‘il-
legitimate demand.”

Divers have found the crew compart-
ment containing remains of the as-
tronauts of the ill-fated space shuttle
Challenger. NASA announced a policy

Marcos ousted, Reagan calls for contra aid

Last weekend a crowd of 80,000
abortion rights activists marched to the

37,000.

An FBI investigation reports that
nearly 200 federal employees hold phony

about as happy as he makes up his mind
to be.”

New housing lottery features open room selection

By KEITH FINCH
Davidson students who want
to live on campus next year will
have to take part in a new lottery
system which involves an “open”
room sign-up procedure.
. According to a, brochure to be

released..next week, by the Hous- —

ing Office, this year’s room selec-
tion procedure will take place in
the Chambers Gallery where stu-
dents will have the opportunity to
choose their rooms from a poster
showing layouts of dormitories
and indicating which rooms are
still available. Students will be ad-
mitted to the sign-up area in the
order of their lottery numbers to
select their rooms.

The room sign-ups will take
place on two nights in April, and
students who miss the sign-ups
will be moved to the end of the
list. However, students will be
able to have friends select rooms
for them.

Housing director Tom Jen-
nings said that the new procedure
is intended to increase student in-
volvement in the room-selection
process.

“The main advantage I see
coming from the new system will
be the open-room sign-up proce-
dure,” Jennings said. “It brings
the system out into the open. In
the past part of the problem was
that people didn’t see things hap-
pening — they assumed that the
Housing, staff was just making ar-
bitrary decisions about rooms.
Now, students will be able to see
each other taking their rooms out
from under their noses rather than
assuming that it happens in the
housing office.”

Assistant Housing Director
Debbie Young said, “The reason
we're moving to having the stu-
dents actively participate is to
allow the students to actually see
the rooms as they are marked off.
We're not trying to hide anything;
we want to get it out into the

”

open.

Jennings said that he and the
housing staff had considered other
possible room selection systems,
including computer assignment
and a “first come, first served”
system in which students would
be assigned rooms on the basis of
their position in line. “We didn’t
want people camping out to get
the first places in line,” Jennings
said.

In past years, students submit-
ted cards listing room preferences
to the Housing Office, whereupon
staff members proceeded to assign
rooms based upon the order of stu-
dents’ lottery numbers.

Jennings foresees some poten-
tial for problems with the new sys-
tem, stemming mostly from stu-
dent’s lack of familiarity with the
rules. “It’s new, and if people
don’t read the information there’ll
be a lot of trouble on those two
nights. But we’re expecting them
to read the information, and if
they don’t know what's going on,
it’ll be their own problem.”

No special privileges

Further changes in housing
policy include an end to special
privileges for rising juniors forced
off campus during their sopho-
more year. This year’s rising
juniors will be allowed to draw
senior numbers as they had been
promised, but this may be the last
year that this special privilege will
be offered.

Jennings said that the Housing
Office decided not to allow senior
privileges to students forced off
campus, because many groups
want the same privilege. “All
sorts of people want special
privileges,” Jennings said, “like
the freshman girls who have to
live on fourth [floor] Little (Hall)
and complain about that. It’s the
same way with the freshman
males who have to live on Belk’s
[Dormitory] basement and never
have a freshman hall. How are we

supposed to decide who gets the
special privileges?” Jennings
added that it is sometimes difficult
to tell which rising sophomores
are actually forced off campus.
“Eliminating the special privilege
makes it a truer lottery.”

He added, however, that the
decision is not final. “We’re going
to keep track of the sophomores
who are forced off campus this
year, because the issue is still
open to debate. I think Dean Terry
is pushing towards keeping the
sophomore advantage.”

Less clustering

Another change in housing
policy is the decision to prevent
social groups from taking over
dormitories or halls. The policy
reads, “No more than 16 students
from any social group, eating
house, or fraternity may block to-
gether in any hall or section of a
residence hall. It is the intention of
the College that we are an inte-

grated community, not a segre-
gated one.”

Young said that the decision to
prevent concentrations of large
numbers of students from the
same social groups is well within
the authority of the Housing Of-
fice. She said, “If for any reason a
student’s behavior warrants dis-
cipline, then they can be penalized
through their lottery choice.
That’s been found to be a very ef-
fective means of discipline.”

Young used the decision made
last year to limit the rooms made
available to members of Sigma
Alpha Epsilon as an example:
“The SAE’s were kept from clus-
tering in Knox because they had
been so destructive before. They
were trying to take over the whole
dorm because it was so close to
their fraternity house. We kept
them out for the college's bene-
fit.”

No storage in rooms
The Housing Office has also
decided to require that all personal
belongings be removed from
rooms when students leave for
summer break. In the past, stu-
dents retaining their rooms have
been allowed to keep sofas, car-
pets, and other furniture in their
rooms during the summer.
Jennings explained that rooms
containing furniture can be offen-
sive to students and parents stay-
ing at Davidson for camps, con-
ferences, and freshman orienta-
tion, particularly if the furniture is
of low quality. ‘There are 28 con-
ferences and camps at Davidson
that we must house during the
summer,” Jennings said, ‘and
there are between 600 and 700
people here at times. It's really
hard to go though dorms and mark
the rooms that can’t be used.”
Jennings also said that it is dif-
ficult for college personnel to
clean around furniture left in
rooms over the summer.
