Messiaen Creates Apocalyptic Quartet

“I saw a mighty angel come

down from heaven, clothed with
a cloud, and a rainbow was
upon his head, and his face was
as if it were the sun, and his feet
.as pillars of fire.

“He set his right foot upon the
sea, and his left foot upon the
earth, lifted up his hand to
heaven, and swore by Him that
liveth forever and ever, saying:
THERE SHALL BE TIME NO
LONGER; but in the days of the

Trumpet of the seventh angel.
the mystery of God shall be
finished.”

This text (‘‘Revelation of St.
John”: Chapter 10, Verses 1-7)
was the inspiration for ‘the
“Quartet for the End of Time”’
composed and premiered at a
prison camp in Silesia in 1941 by
the contemporary French com-
poser Olivier Messiaen (b.
1908).

He is featured in a recently
released Angel recording (s-
36587) with Michel Beroff at the
piano; Gervase de Peyer, clar-

Dlassical

inet; Erich Gruenberg, violin;
and William Pleeth on the cel-
lo.

The experience of a New Years’ eve per-
formance by Tim Weisburg in Atlanta con-
vincingly demonstrates that Weisberg is anar-
tist capable of combining creative musical
genius with an electrifying stage perfor-
mance.

Tim Weisburg is a flutist. But to describe his
music is to confront that awful dilemma of
selecting rubrics under which to identify con-
temporary music.

“Basically I guess it’s pop or rock flute,’’ he
explained, quick to deny the label ‘‘jazz.”’
‘Don’t use jazz,’’ he said. Yet he admits that

much of the material he and his supporting
band perform has a jazz flavor, while
acknowledging that there is apparently a
recent trend toward jazz oriented rock music.

“T think rock musicians are listening to
more and more jazz. I think they look up to
jazz musicians and admire their music.”’

This attention to more serious musical ex-
pression Weisburg attributes to a heightened
level of listening in rock music.

“I think audiences are (and have been) way,
way ahead of recording companies. Back in
1970 or so before I had a record contract,
nobody~record companies, concert agents,
club owners—would buy instrumental music.

“The Mahavishnu Orchestra started it all,
and now it’s the thing. The audiences have
been ready for a long time.”

For Tim Weisburg, the. audience is an im-
portant consideration. ‘‘More than anything, I
love to play in front of an audience.” Having
seen his show I am utterly convinced of the
sincerity of that statement.

In his performance he demonstrates a
technical proficiency as a musician that com-
plements his exuberancéas a performer.

“Being a performer goes along with being
an innovator in music, I think.

“T like performing more than anything. A
show would have a beginning-something that
excites the audience—a middle, and an end.
The whole thing should flow.

‘‘Just like when you are putting together an
album; you have the tunes on tape, but they
change according to the order you put them in.
The same is true for a live performance.”’

As for the music he is doing now, Weisberg is
conscious of tonal development.

“I think you can see something begin in
“Dreamspeaker,”’ the third album, and con-
tinue in the fourth ( ‘Tim Weisberg 4’ ).

“Tt’s an ensemble sound, the focus is on the
blending of flute and guitar playing the same
lines together. I try to keep the flute
recognizable on top of the rhythm.”’

This is a' technique which shows itself
clearly in such varying musical styles as Dave
Mason (guitar and voice), and as Weisberg
also pointed out, in the Allman Brothers
Band’s use of two guitars or guitar and
keyboard along with voice to create two and
three melodic lines simultaneously..

‘The music has also grown in the direction
| of our use of the synthesizer that provides
| tonal color.”’ |
j Yet for the listener, somewhere in the music
; there is an expression that seems to go beyond
| instrumental.

Weisberg noted how Ian Anderson (of Jethro
j Tull) uses both flute and voice in rock, and
| described how he himself prefers to use the
| flute all the time as a voice.

Still, an interviewer once asked him (after
| demonstrating his seeming familiarity with

Weisberg’s music) about the use of lyrics and
Weisberg was forced to explain to the embar-
rassed writer the absence of voice.

Though he admits he has “‘listened to rock
and roll forever,’”’ Weisberg’s background is
classical.

‘I like to listen to classical music for profi-
ciency, and I still practice and take lessons. I
guess I started jamming with the flute about
six years ago.”’

Weisberg is proud that ‘I am doing exactly
what I want to do.

‘“‘The record compay is confused, but they
try to stay out of the way.”’ He built his band
with the idea in mind of what kind of music he
wanted to do, and with the freedom afforded
him through his obvious success in rock music
he is pleased that he has ‘“‘never had to con-
sciously try to be innovative or sell something.

“I guess most of the albums sell in the 17-24
group, but it ranges from 14 on up,”’ Weisberg
said. .

The members of his band all have rock
backgrounds and Weisberg chose them
because of their excellent talents. He sees
himself as a catalyst in composition, but the
music is developed with a majority of ideas
discussed with the band. :

“I think of myself as a leader soloist, but
also as a member of an ensemble. :

“T may motivate what is created, but I think
orchestrally. I like to use the group |secause it
is constructed of incredible musicians.” é

As for new directions for Weisberg, he ex-
plained that the next album, including
material now being developed, will be more
challenging music for the band.

He has considered a solo album making use
of all of the studio effects possible with his

’ flute, but for Weisberg that is not for now; it

will have to come at the right stage of his
career.

Presently Weisberg mostly concerns him-
self with writing music for the show. He
prefers concerts to club dates because he can
focus on the performance with fewer distrac-..
tions. Mostly he just loves what he will be
doing here.

“T love to perform and college dates are my
favorite- no doubt about it- I love college con-
certs.’

For Weisberg performance is contact, and
he expressed genuine excitement at making
contact with the Davidson community in his
upcoming show Jan. 18 in Love Auditorium.’

The work was scored in this
unusual fashion since these in-
struments were the only ones
available in the prison camp.
The performances are truly im-
pressive—including some of the
most incredible clarinet playing
I have’ever heard--and the
recording quality and disc sur-
faces are excellent.

The Quartet consists of eight
parts all interrelated: Crystal
Liturgy, Vocalise for the Angel
who announces the end of time,
Abyss of the Birds, Intermezzo,
In praise of the Eternity of
Jesus, Dance of Fury for the
seven trumpets, Cluster of rain-
bows for the Angel who an-
nounces the end of Time, and,
In praise of the Immortality of
Jesus.

Messiaen writes of the reason
for the text: ‘‘... I was drawn
not to the cataclysms and mon-
sters of the Apocalypse, but
rather to its silences of
adoration, its marvelous visions
of peace.”’

The composition geflects
marly of Messiaen’s “revolu-
tionary attitudes towards his
art and represents one of the
formative works for his unique
musical language.

For instance: the vision of the
rainbow was used as an op-
portunity to employ varying in-
tensities of sound color. The
idea of Time and the end of it is

represented by Messiaen’s em- .

ployment of simple and com-
plex rhythmic formulas used in
a normal mode; in retrograde if
possible, and augmented or
diminished in time.

These rhythmic techniques
,are native to non-western music
and alien to Méessiaen’s
teachers: the generation of
Debussy and Ravel. He also em-
ploys transcriptions of Bird-

song, a device dominating
his music today.

Messiaen’s music can be very :

abstract, he employs the
polyphonic writing, with the in-
troduction of polyrhythm as
well, and in this respect adheres
to the French Neo-Classical
Tradition.

At the same time he seeks to

revitalize Romanticism. He’

was a member of the “Young
France’”’ musical group as a
student, an organization foun-
ded to save Romanticism. It
may be that Messiaen has done
so.
He explains his attitude: ‘It
is a glistening music we seek,
giving to the aural sense volup-
tuously refined pleasures. At
the same time this music should
be able to express noble sen-
timents.”’

A second early. work of
Messiaen is also available in a
new recording: ‘Visions de
L’Amen”’ dating from 1943 and
scored for Two Pianos.- It
shocked Paris when it was
premiered after the composer’s
release by the Germans that
year.

Messiaeii seeks to represent
the four meanings of ‘‘Amen’’:

‘“Amen, so be it! The creative
act;

‘“‘Amen, I submit, I accept,
Thy will be done;

‘‘Amen, the wish, the desire,
that this may be, that you may
give tome and Ito you! ;

‘“‘Amen, that is, all is fixed
forever, consummated in
Paradise.”’

There are seven intense
movements: Amen of the
Creation; Amen of the Stars of
the Ringed Planet; Amen of the
Agony of Jesus; Amen of
Desire; Amen of the Angels,
Saints and Birdsong; Amen of
the Judgment; and Amen of the
Consummation.

Its Nanguage is entirely
similar to the Quartet with an-
noying little lapses into more
traditional and less dissonant
harmonic language although in
reducing the level of dissonance
here, unlike the Quartet, he en-
tirely avoids resolving these
passages in a conventional
fashion. It is a minor problem
anyway and rather more
amusing than irritating.

The ‘‘Visions”’ are rich in in-
vention and demand everything
in the way of sound from the
Piano. The grand chorale of the
Creation provides the unifying
force with its processing chords
and ringing bells.

Other themes ranging from
delicate to dramatic, and the
Birdsong are used. In all it is an
overwhelming piece of music.

The performance by Peter
Serkin and Yuji Takahashi
(RCA-ARL-r-0363) is im-
pressive but a bit unrelenting at
times, the recording is clear
and close miked.

The studio seems to have ex-
panded the dynamic range at
the beginning, a cheap gimmic
creating the unrealistic im-
pression of the sound there.
