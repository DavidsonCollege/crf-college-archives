four literary societies of the colleges, the
Eumenean, Philanthropic, Pandeinic, and
Metrophilian meet together in Shearer
Hall for the annual Senior Oratorical
Contest and the award of inter-socicty
medals. Contrary to the custom of the!
past two years, the awards of diplomas
will not be made in the joint meeting, but
will occur immediately after the an-
nouncement of the winner of the oratori-
cal contest, in the two literary society
halls, the Eumenean and Pandeinic so-
cieties meeting in the Eumenean hall, and
the Philanthrope hall.

The four finalists in the oratorical con-
test were selected in a preliminary held
early in January from among the best
speakers of the Senior class. F, A. Hop-
kins, the first speaker representing the
Eumenean Society will speak on the sub-
ject, The Individual and the Nation.
D. B. Wharton of the Metrophilian So-
cicty speaks next on the subject War
Wisdom. HH. B. Price, the third speaker,
the Pandeinic representative, and
speaks on the subject Whither. The
final orator of the evening is A. C. Ray,
Jr., the second man from the Metrophil-
ian Society to enter the finals, speaks on
the subject, The Clash of Color. :

The Metrophilian leads’ with two men
in the finals, the Eumenean and Pan-
deinic Societies being represented by one
man each, and the Philanthropic failing
to have a speaker. Three of the speak-
ers, Hopkins, Ray, and Wharton were
finalists in the Junior contest last spring,
Wharton winning. The fourth speaker,
Price, did not go out for the Junior
Speaking contest, but showed up well in

Pandeinic Springs From Eumenean
—Metrophilian From
Philanthropic

During the year 1921-22, the Freshman
year of the graduating class, two new literary
societies, the Pandeinic Metrophilian,
came into aah

In the early days of the colleve the literary
societies held a premier place among the out

posed largely from state of

' North Carolina, and the Eumenean Society

(fus) consisting of students from without
the Tar Heel State. Competition in those
days ran high, and centers of great interest
to the older alumni are the two literary so-
ciety halls.

With the advent of and growing interest
in athletics, and the other forms of extra-
curricular activity, which are now legion, in-
terest in the literary societies began to wane,
and it was felt by certain members of the
faculty Well as by Senior and Junior
members of the old dus and Phis that the
creation of two new socicties would increase

as

the total membership and add zest to inter-
The two societies there-
fore branched, in November, 1921, and from

society competition,

the old Eumenecan there sprang the Pandei
nic, and from the old Philanthropic the Mets
rophilian societies. The location from whieh
a man comes has nothing to.do with which
society he shall join, but the competition
among the societies is free.

The results have justified the hopes of the
founders, and the college generation of the
class of 1925 has seen renewed interest in
literary society work, debating, declaiming,
essay writing, the practice of’ parliamentary
law, ete. This interest has been augmented
this year by the enthusiasm of
Wachter.

Professor

The new societies have shown themselves
to be up to the calibre of the old, the Metro-
philian having furnished a number of inter-
collegiate debaters and the Pandeinic having

won a large majority of the_inter-society
contests since its founding.

It is hoped by the members of the two
new societies that soon they will have society
halls of their own, and will not longer have
to sponge on the hospitality of their fore-
bears.

The future for the literary societies is
very bright. Results both locally and in
inter-collegiate debating contests during the
past year have been most gratifying. If the
next college generation will increase even
more literary and forensic interest and work,
much may be expected from the Eumenean,
Philanthropic, Pandeinic, and Metrophilian
literary societies.

It may be of interest to visitors to know
that the chandelier which hangs in Phi hall
is a gift to the college, and, being brought
over from France, is supposed to be an exact
imitation of the chandelier under which Na-
poleon Bonaparte was married.

Woodrow Wilson, during his year at Da-
vidson, was a member of the Eumenean so-
ciety, and records of his work are kept in
the college library by Miss Shaw, librarian.

of Georgia, he has written an account of
early history of that State.

James Ross McCain was born in the
year 1881. He-is a graduate of Erskine
College, Due West, S. C., of the class of
1900, He received his Master of Arts
degree in the year 1906, and the degree
of LL.B. in 1901. His degree of Doctor
of Philosophy was received from Colum-
hia University in 1014. In the years fol-
lowing his graduation from Erskine he
was both a lawyer and a school teacher.
In 1005 he founded the Darlington School
in Ga., and head until
115. This school of the best
Preparatory Schools in the South, and
it is to the credit of Dr. McCain that he
should have been the founder and head
of such institution, His association
with Agnes Scott College began in 1915.
At that time he was registrar of the col-
lege and professor of Economics. Later
he became Vice-President of the insti-
tution, and since May 25, 1923 has been
President. Although he has only been
head of the college for two years he has
caused many changes and improvements
brought about. As its efficient
leader Agnes Scott will doubtless
tinue and expand its great usefulness in
the South.

Seniors Welcome
Last Year’s Class

The class of '25 is glad to welcome back
to the hill the many members of the class
of '24 who, it is hoped, will return to renew
old friendships at their alma mater.

R. R. Jones, president of last year’s grad-
uating class, has put forth every effort to
insure a reunion of the class, practically en
masse. J. L. McLean has been handling a
part of the arrangements and the merry
helloes of the newest alumni will ring out
joyously.

A luncheon for the class, it is understood,
is being arranged, where reminiscences, hopes
and plans can have free play.

Twenty-five wishes to the class ahead of
her a most happy and successful reunion.
