Life/ work planning

Wood questions educational goals

of a life-affirmer, helping anyone
interested in becoming involved in the
asthat world in a more total manner than is

1 ordinarily possible on campus.

‘‘A basic principle around which we
organize our activities is openness to
a variety of experiences, cultures, and
stimulating human beings. We can
send out feelers to much more of the
world than we have traditionally,
particularly on a campus that tends to

be homogenous. We need to be open
to other influences than those which
are dominant here; I try to commu-
nicate to students that the whole
world is available, that we can take

control of our lives and grasp those
qualities which make us truly alive.”

“I would like to see this institution
become a place that increasingly

turns people on to their own unique
ahilities and personal initiatives,’’

“It is neat that we have the librar:
and the union programs, but equall:,
important. are transactions with the
rest of the world. That active inter-
face is vital, so that students get out
and participate rather than just
thinking.”’

Wood believes that an adequate
model for education is action followed
by reflection; in any case, action
should not be divorced from reflec-
tion.

He draws an example from his
current hobby: “If you try to learn
about biking by reading a book about
it, you end up incapable and lacking
enthusiasm.

“On the other hand, if you get out
and ride first, you can come back and
read avidly about the problems and
joys of cycling,

“IT would like to expose people to
the color of life-“to the sounds and the
feel, so that students here won’t have
to merely intellectualize about what

concept of love; love is a means to
creativity.”
He sees his role at Davidson

Ken Wood believes that academic
learning is important, but that off-
campus involvements with human
problems are also vital to fulfillment,

Wood does not like the word
“career.’”’ To him it connotes that
there is a niche or mold that a person
must find and fill, whereas he sees
vocation as more a creative process.

“Work is that which you use to
actualize yourself,’’ said Wood, ‘‘and
this may include various occupational
settings in one lifetime. In as much as
we strive for new forms in the world,
we create ourselves. The concept of
creating is more basic even than the

Patterson Court cuts back,
houses must fight for funds

By SCOTT REID
Staff Writer :

The Patterson Court Coun-
cil (PCC) will be reformed this
year because of two. new
factors: the tight money sit-
uation generally and the open-
ing of the Grey Union building
specifically.

At the beginning of last
year the PCC had an unu-
sually large budget with which
to work. There was the
$14,000 allocated for ’74-’75
plus $2,000 left over from the
year before.

Nonetheless, that budget
was over-spent by about
$1200. The deficit was dis-
covered at the end of last year
when Emanon fraternity
needed to replace its refri-
gerator.

That money has been taken
out of the PCC’s ’75-’76 bud-
get, a budget that had already
been cut by $2,000 by the
college for economic reasons.
The council begins this year
with less funds than usual,
about $10,000.

The PCC was formed in
1970 to appropriate money to
the fraternity houses for furn-
iture, equipment, furnishings
and _repairs to same. It is also
supposed to coordinate the
fraternities and the college,
and work for a better atmos-
phere on the court. The latter
function has been largely ig-
nored in the past. .

“In the past, council mem-
bers would say, ‘Well, let that
house have the money they’ve
asked for to repair their bar,
and next month they’ll let us
have the money we need for a
new ping-pong table,’ ” said
Jeff Neikirk, President of ‘the
PCC

being as tight as it is, it will be
interesting to see each house
fight for its share.”

Neikirk, who admits that

“This year, with money

the PCC has been very loosely
run in the past, has worked on
some new ideas with Robert
Currie, College Business Man-
ager, on how the funds should
be allocated to the\houses this
year.

“Our main idea is to get a
set of guidelines down on
paper that will show what the
PCC will fund for the houses
and what the houses must
supply for themselves.

“Our two suggestions for

yearly allowances are these:
three dollars per person in
each house for silverware,
plates and other flatware plus
an additional $200-250 per
house for general repairs and
furnishings. Currie wants the

‘ NEIKIRK

council to keep charge of these
allowances.” said Neikirk.

These two allowances would
deplete the PCC budget by
about $5,000, leaving an equal
amount on reserve for large
expenditures that can not be
foreseen at this time, such as
the replacement of refregera-
tors, stoves, and other essen-
tial equipment.

Currie has decided that he
must keep a closer watch this
year on the PCC’s budget
because it was overspent this

year. In particular he is in-
sisting that .he have final
approval on all expenditures
by the PCC.

“This has always supposed
to have been the procedure in
the past,’’ said Currie. ‘I’ve
had the whole thing spelled
out this year because it ap-
pears that last year’s  over-
spending resulted from the
PCC’s not following this pro-
cedure.”’

From now on all capital
items must be _ purchased
through the college. The col-
lege is sales-tax exempt and
can often buy equipment from
wholesalers for less than the
non-tax exempt fraternities
can. Each item to be replaced
(ie: stove, refrigerator, TV,
etc.) must be inspected by the
College Engineer to see if it
cannot be repaired for less.

“I was ecstatic with the
results,”” commented debate
captain Gordon Widenhouse

In the eight preliminary
rounds Davidson finished with
a 5-3 record. j
Seeded twelfth of the top
sixteen teams in the elimina-

Continuing to the quarter-
finals, the team upset William

Scranton University in the
semi-finals, they went on to
lose to Catholic with a two-one
decision on the part of the
judges.

“I think this goes a long
way in proving that the
Davidson debate program is
reaching a high level in debate
competition, ” continued
Widenhouse. He said that
Davidson had always don.
well jn the ‘‘Carolina Circuit”

that is area competition.
Some consider the Hopkins
Invitational in the top twenty
debate tournaments in the
coutitry. “By far this is the
best Davidson has done in a
tournament of this quality,”
observed Widenhouse.

tion under their belts, the de-
bate team is looking forward
to the Wake Forest Junior
Varsity T, t > Oct
ber 24-26. This competition is
one of the largest of its kind in
the southeast.
Davidson is hoping to take
